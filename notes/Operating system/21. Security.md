# Security
**Protection and security**. A protection system is ineffective if user authentication is compromised or a program is run by an unauthorized user
* *Protection*. An internal problem concerning how to provide controlled access to programs and dat stored in a computer system
* *Security*. Require an adequate protection and consideration of the external environment, within which the system operates

**Security of computer resources**. Must be guarded against unauthorized access, malicious destruction or alteration, and accidental introduction of inconsistency

$\to$ This chapter examines ways, in which resources may be accidentally or purposely misused

## The security problem
**Secure system**.
* *Motivation*. The OS can provide mechanisms, with appropriate aid from the hardware, allowing users to protect their resources, including programs and data

    $\to$ This works well only as long as the users conform the intended use of and access to these resources
* *Secure system*. A system is secure if its resources are used and accessed as intended under all circumstances
    * *Problem*. Total security cannot be achieved, hence we must have mechanisms to make security breaches a rare occurrence, rather than the norm

**Security violations (or misuse) categories of the system**. These violations can be categorized as internal, i.e. malicious, or accidental

$\to$ It is easier to protect against accidental misuse than malicious misuse

>**NOTE**. For the most part, protection mechanisms are the core of protection from accidents

* *Terminology*.
    * *Intruder and cracker*. Those attempting to breach security
    * *Thread*. The potential for a security violation, e.g. the discovery of vulnerability
    * *Attack*. The attempt to break security
* *Breach of confidentiality*. Involve unauthorized reading of data, or theft of information

    $\to$ This is typically the goal of an intruder
* *Breach of integrity*. Involve unauthorized destruction of data
* *Theft of service*. Involve unauthorized use of resources
* *Denial of service (DOS)*. Involve preventing legitimate use of the system

**Methods of attack**.
* *Masquerading*. One participant in a communication pretends to be someone else, e.g. another host or another person

    $\to$ Attackers breach authentication, i.e. the correctness of identification
    * *Consequence*. 
        * Attackers can gain access that they would not normally be allowed or 
        * Attackers can escalate their privileges, i.e. obtain privileges to which they would not normally be entitled
* *Replay attack*. Consist of the malicious or fraudulent repeat of a valid data transmission

    $\to$ This is frequently done along with message modification, to escalate privileges
* *Man-in-the-middle attack*. An attacker sits in the data flow of a communication, masquerading as the sender to the receiver, and vice versa

    $\to$ This can be preceded by a session hijacking, i.e. an active communication is intercepted

**Levels of security measures**. The cost to the perpetrator can be made sufficiently high to deter most intruders

>**NOTE**. In some cases, it is preferable to prevent the attack, but sufficient to detect the attack then take countermeasures

* *Physical*. The site or sites containing the computer system must be physically secured against armed or surreptitious entry by intruders

    $\to$ Both the machine rooms and the terminals or workstations having access to the machines must be secured
* *Human* Authorization must be done carefully to assure that only appropriate users have access to the system
    * *Threats from authorized users*. Authorized users may be encouraged to let others use their access
    * *Social engineering*. Authorized users can be tricked via social engineering into allowing access
        * *Phishing*. A legitimate-looking e-mail or Web page misleads a user to entering confidential information
        * *Dumpster diving*. Attempting to gather information to gain unauthorized access to the computer
* *OS*. The system must protect itself from accidental or purposeful security breaches
* *Network*. 
    * Intercepting data travelling over private leased lines and shared lines could be as harmful as breaking into a computer
    * Interruption of communication may constitute a remote DOS attack, diminishing users' user of and trust in the system
