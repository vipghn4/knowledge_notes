# 7. Virtual machines
## Introduction
The layered approach is taken to its logical conclusion in the concept of virtual machine

**Fundamental idea**. Abstract the hardware of a single computer, i.e. CPU, memory, disk drives, etc. into several different execution environments

$\to$ This creates the illusion that each separate execution environment is running its own private computer

* *Mechanism*.
    * By using CPU scheduling and virtual-memory techniques

        $\to$ An OS host can create the illusion that a process has its own processor with its own (virtual) memory, i.e. the virtual machine provides an interface that is identical to the underlying bare hardware
    * Each guest process is provided with a (virtual) copy of the underlying computer

        >**NOTE**. Usually, the guess process is, in fact, an OS

>**NOTE**. Virtual machine is how a single physical machine can run multiple OSes concurrently, each in its own VM

## Benefits
**Key idea**. Most of the benefits of using BMs relates to being able to share the same hardware yet run several different execution environments concurrently

**Protection**. The host system is protected from the VMs, and VMs are protected from each other
* *Pros*. Each VM is completely isolated from all other VMs and the host

    $\to$ There is no protection problems
* *Cons*. There is no direct sharing of resources
    * *Solutions*. There are two approaches
        * *Shared-memory-based approach*. Share a file-system volume, thus to share files
        * *Message-passing-based approach*. Define a network of VMs, each of which can send information over the virtual communication network

            >**NOTE**. The network is modeled after physical communication networks but is implemented in software

**OS research**. a VM system is a perfect vehicle for OSes research and development

**System-development time**. a VM system can eliminate much of the problem of system-development time, i.e. the system is unavailable to users during system-development time
* *Explain*. System programmers are given their own VM, and system development is done on the VM instead of on a physical machine
* *Consequence*. Easier for OS development

**Concurrent OSes**. Multiple OSes can be running on the developer's workstation concurrently
* *Consequences*.
    * Allow rapid porting and testing of programs in varying environments
    * Quality-assurance engineers can test their applications in multiple environments without buying, powering, and maintaining a computer for each environment

**System consolidation in production data-center**. Users can take two or more separate systems and run them in VMs on one system

**Packaging applications**. If a system can easily add, remove, and move a VM, application developers can pre-install the application on a tuned and customized OS in a VM
* *Consequences*.
    * Easier application management with less tuning required
    * Technical support of the application will be more straightforward
    * Easier for system administrators to manage the environment
    * Easier to install and redeploy the application to another system
* *Requirements*. The format of VMs must be standardized so that any VM will run on any virtualization platform

## Simulation
**System emulation**. Emulation, in a software context, is the use of an application program or device to imitate the behavior of another program or device

>**NOTE**. System virtualization is just one of many system-emulation methodologies

>**NOTE**. Virtualization is the most ocmmon since it makes the guest OSes and applications believe they are running on native hardware

**Simulation**. The host system has one system architecture, and the guest was compiled for a different architecture
* *Example*. When we want to continue running certain important outdated programs on new computers
* *Idea*. The emulator translates each of the outdated system's instructions into the native instruction set of the new system
* *Pros and cons*.
    * *Pros*. Emulation can increase the life of programs and allow us to explore old architectures, without having an actual old machine
    * *Cons*.
        * Bad performance, since instruction-set emulation can run an order of magnitude slower than native instructions

            $\to$ Unless the new machine is ten times faster than the old, the program running on the new machine will run more slowly than it did on its native hardware
        * Correct emulator is difficult to be created

## Para-virtualization
**Para-virtualization**. Another variation of VMs
* *Idea*. Rather than trying to trick a guest OS into believing it has a system to itself

    $\to$ Para-virtualization presents the guest with a system, which is similar but not identical to the guest's preferred system
* *Pros and cons*.
    * *Pros*. More efficient use of resources and smaller virtualization layer
    * *Cons*. The guest must be modified to run on the paravirtualized hardware

**Solaris 10 OS**. An example of paravirtualization

    <figcaption>Solaris 10 with two containers</figcaption>
</div>

* *Idea*. Have containers, or zones, which create a virtual layer between the OS and the applications
* *Mechanism*.
    * Only one kernel is installed, and the hardware is not virtualized

        $\to$ The OS and its devices are virtualized, providing processes within a container with the impression that they are the only process on the system
    * One or more containers can be created, each of which can have its own applications, network stacks, network address, and ports, etc.
    * CPU resources can be divided up among the containers and the systemwide processes

## Implementation
**Problem of implementation**. It is difficult to implement a VM, i.e. much work is required to provide an exact duplicate of the underlying machine
* *Explain*. The VM software can run in kernel mode, since it is the OS, but the VM can execute in only user mode

    $\to$ We must have a virtual user mode and a virtual kernel mode, just as the physical machine, both of which run in a physical user mode

**Tranferring from user mode to kernel mode on a VM**.
1. When a system call is made by a program running on a VM in virtual user mode

    $\to$ It creates a transfer to the VM monitor in the real machine
2. When the VM monitor gains control, it can change the register contents and program counter for the virtual machine to simulate the effect of the system call
3. The VM monitor, in virtual kernel mode, then restart the VM

**Hardware supports**. Without some level of hardware support, virtualization would be impossible

$\to$ The more hardware support available within a system, the more feature rich, stable, and well performing the VMs can be
* *Example of hardware support*. In AMD processors define two new modes of operation, i.e. host and gurst
    * VM software can enable host mode, define the characteristics of each guest VM, then switch the system to guest mode, passing control of the system to the guest OS running in the VM
    * In guest mode, the virtualized OS thinks it is running on native hardware and sees certain devices

        $\to$ If the guest tries to access a virtualized resource, then control is passed to the host to manage that interaction
