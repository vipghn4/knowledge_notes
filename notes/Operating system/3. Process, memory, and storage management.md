# 3. Process, memory, and storage management
## Process management
**Process** (Recall). A running program
* *Program and process*.
    * A program is a passive entity
    * A process is an active entity
* *Process execution*. A single-threaded process has one program counter (PC) specifying the next instruction to execute
    * *Sequential execution*. The execution of a process must be sequential

        $\to$ THe CPU executes one instruction of the process after another, until the process completes
        
        >**NOTE**. At any time, one instruction at most is executed on the behalf of the process
        >$\to$ Although two processes maybe associated with the same program, they are nevertheless considered two separate execution sequences

    >**NOTE**. A multithreaded process has multiple PCs, each pointing to the next instruction to execute for a given thread

**Process as the system unit of work**. A system consists of a collection of processes
* *Types of processes*.
    * *OS processes*. Execute system code
    * *User processes*. Execute user code

**Problem**. 
* *Resource allocation to processes*.
    * A process needs certain resources, i.e. CPU time, memory, files, and I/O devices, to accomplish its task

        $\to$ These resources are given to the process when it is created, or allocated to it while it is running
    * Various intialization data, i.e. input, maybe passed along the process
* *Resource retrieval from processes*. When the process terminates, the OS will reclaim any reusable resources

**OS' roles**.
* Scheduling processes and threads on the CPUs
* Creating and deleting both user and system processes
* Suspending and resuming processes
* Providing mechanisms for process synchronization
* Providing mechanism for process communication

## Memory management
**Main memory** (Recall). A repository of quickly accessible data shared by the CPU and I/O devices
* *Structure*. A large array of words or bytes, ranging in size from hundreds of thousands to billions

    $\to$ Each word or byte has its own address
* *Interactions with the CPU*. On a von Neumann architecture, the central processor 
    * Reads instructions from main memory during the instruction-fetch cycle
    * Reads and writes data from main memory during the data-fetch cycle

>**NOTE**. The main memory is generally the only large storage device, which the CPU can address and access directly
>* *Example*. 
>    * To process data from disk, the data must be transferred to main memory by CPU-generated I/P calls
>    * To execute an instruction, the instruction must be in main memory first

**Program execution**. 
* *Prior to execution*. For a program to be executed, it must be mapped to absolute addresses and loaded into memory
* *During execution*. During execution, the program accesses program instructions and data from memory by generating the absolute addresses above
* *Posterior to execution*. The program terminates, its memory space is declared available

    $\to$ The next program can be loaded and executed

**Memory management schemes**. 
* *Motivation*. To improve both the utilization of the CPU and the speed of the computer's response to its user, general-purpose computers must keep several programs in memory

    $\to$ There is a need for memory management
* *Memory management schemes*. Many different memory management schemes are used

    $\to$ These schemes reflect various approaches
    * *Effectiveness of scheme algorithm*. Depending on the situation
    * *Selecting memory management scheme*. We must take into account many factors, especially the hardware design of the system
        * *Explain*. Each algorithm requires its own hardware support

**OS' roles**.
* Keeping track of which parts of memory are currently being used and by whom
* Deciding which processes, or parts, and data to move into and out of memory
* Allocating and deallocating memory space as needed

## Storage management
**File**. The OS abstracts from the physical properties of its storage devices to define a logical storage unit, i.e. the file

$\to$ The OS maps files onto physical media and accesses these files via the storage devices

### File-system management
**File**. A collection of related information defined by its creator
* *Usage*. Commonly used to represent programs, i.e. both source and object forms, and data, i.e. numeric, alphabetic, alphanumeric, or binary
* *File format*. Can be free-form, e.g. text files, or can be formatted rigidly, e.g. fixed fields
* *Implementation*. The OS implements the abstract concept of a file by managing mass-storage media, and the device controlling them
* *Files organization*. Files are normally organized into directories to make them easier to use

>**NOTE**. When multiple users have access to files, it is desirable to control by whom and in what ways files may be accessed

**OS' roles**.
* Creating and deleting files
* Creating and deleting directories to organize files
* Supporting primitives for manipulating files and directories
* Mapping files onto secondary storage
* Backing up files on stable, i.e. nonvolatile, storage media

### Mass-storage management
**Motivation**. Main memory is too small to store all data and programs, and it is volatile

$\to$ We need secondary storage to back up main memory

**Secondary storage**. Most modern computer systems use disks as the principle on-line storage medium for both programs and data
* *Data storation for programs*.
    * Most programs, e.g. compilers, assemblers, workd processors, etc. are stored on a disk until loaded into memory
    * Most programs use the disk as both the source and destination of their processing
* *Consequence*. The proper management of disk storage is of central importance to a computer system

>**NOTE**. The secondary storage must be used efficiently
>* *Explain*. The entire speed of operation of a computer may hinge on the speeds of the disk subsystem and the algorithms manipulating the subsystem

* *OS' roles*.
    * Free-space management
    * Storage allocation
    * Disk scheduling

**Tertiary storage**. There are many uses of storage, which is slower and lower in cost than secondary storage, e.g. backup of disk data, seldom-used data, etc.

$\to$ We can use tertiary storage devices, e.g. magnetic tape drivers, CD, DVD, etc.
* *Storage formats*. Vary from WORM (write-once, read-many-times) and RW (read-write) formats
* *Tertiary storage management*. Some OSes take on this task, while others leave this task to application programs
* *OS' roles*.
    * Mounting and unmounting meida in devices
    * Allocating and freeing the devices for exclusive use by processes
    * Migrating data from secondary to tertiary storage

### Caching
**Caching**. An important principle of computer systems
* *Information storage and usage*.
    * *Storage*. Information is normally kept in some storage system, e.g. main memory
    * *Usage*.
        1. As it is used, information is copied into a faster storage system, i.e. the cache, on a temporary basis
        2. When we need a particular piece of information
            
            $\to$ We first check whether it is in the cache. If so, we use the information directly from the cache. Otherwise we use the information from the source, putting a copy in the cache under the assumption that we will need it again
            
**Types of caches**.
* *Programmable caches*. Caches which can be programmed
    * *Example*. Internal programmable registers, eg. index registers, provide a high-speed cache for main memory
        * *Register allocation and replacement*. Implemented by the programmer, or compiler, to decide 
            * Which information to keep in registers
            * Which to keep in main memory
* *Nonprogrammable caches*. Caches totally implmeneted in hardware
    * *Example*. Most systems have an instruction cache to hold instructions expected to executed next

        $\to$ Without this cache, the CPU would have to wait several cycles while an instruction was fetched from main memory
    
    >**NOTE**. We are not concern with nonprogrammable caches since they are outside the control of the OS

**File-system hierarchy**. The file-system data residing permanently on secondary storage may appear on several levels in the storage hierarchy

    <figcaption>Migration of variable A from disk to register</figcaption>
</div>

* *File-system hierarchy*.
    * *Main memory*. The OS may maintain a cache of file-system data in main memory

        >**NOTE**. Electronic RAM disks (solid-state disks) may be used for high-speed storage, which is access through the file-system

    * *Magnetic disks*. Contain the bulk of secondary storage
    * *Magnetic tapes and removable disks*. Used to backup magnetic storage to protect against data loss, in case of hard-disk failure
    * *Tertiary storage*. Some system automatically archive old file data from secondary storage to tertiary storage
* *Data movement between levels of a storage hierarchy*. Explicit or implicit, depending on the hardware design and the OS
    * *Example*.
        * Data transfer from cache to CPU and registers is usually a hardware function, without OS intervention
        * Data transfer from disk to memory is usually controlled by the OS

    >**NOTE**. In a hierarchical storage structure, the same data may appear in different levels of the storage system

* *Challenge*. 
    * *Multitasking environment*.The CPU is switched among various processes

        $\to$ If several processes wish to access a variable, then each of these processes should obtain the most recently updated value of that variable
    * *Multiprocessor environment*. In addition to maintaining internal registers, each of the CPUs also contains a local cache. Thus, a copy of a variable may exist simultaneously in several caches

        $\to$ An update to the value of the variable in one cache should be immediately reflected in all other caches where the variable resides
        
        >**NOTE**. This situation is called cache conherency, and it is usually a hardware problem

**Cache management**. Since caches have limited size, cache management is an important design problem
* *Decicions to make*. The cache size and a replacement policy to greatly increase system performance

### I/O systems
**I/O subsystem**. Used to hide the peculiarities of I/O devices from the bulk of the OS
* *Components*.
    * A memory-management component including buffering, caching, and spooling
    * A general device-driver interface
    * Drivers for specific hardware devices

        >**NOTE**. Only the device driver knows the peculiarities of the specific device, to which it is assigned

## Protection and security
**Problem**. If a computer has multiple users and allows the concurrent execution of multiple processes. The access to data must be regulated

$\to$ Mechanisms ensure that files, memory segments, CPU, and other resources can be operated on by only those processes, which have gained proper authorization fom the OS

**Protection**. Any mechanisms for controlling the access of processes or users to the resources defined by the computer system
* *Objectives*. Provide means to
    * Specify the controls to be imposed
    * Enforce the control
* *Pros*.
    * Improve reliablity by detecting latent errors at the interfaces between component subsystems
        * *Explain*. 
            * This prevents contamination of a healthy subsystem by another subsystem, which is malfunctioning
            * This provides a means to distinguish bewteen authorized and unauthorized usage

**Security**. A system can still be pone to failure and allow inappropriate access, despite of adequate protection

$\to$ It is the job of security to defend a system from external and internal attacks

>**NOTE**. Prevention of some of these attacks is considered an OS function on some system, while other systems leave the prevention to policy or additional software

**User identifiers**. Protection and security require the system to be able to distinguish among all its users
* *User identitifers (User IDs)*. Most OSes maintain a list of user names and associated user IDs
    * *Mechanism*. When a user logs into the system, the authentication stage determines the appropriate user ID for the user
    
        $\to$ The ID is associated with all of the user's processes and threads
    * *Readability*. When an ID needs to be readable by user

        $\to$ It is translated back to the user name via the user name list

**Group identifiers**.  Group functionality can be implemented as a system-wide list of group names and group IDs
* *Motivation*. In some cases, we may want to distinguish among sets of users, rather than individual users

    $\to$ We need to define a group name, and the set of users belonging to that group
    * *Example*.
        * The owner of a file on a UNIX system maybe allowed to issue all operation on the faile
        * A selected set of users may only be allowed to read the file
* *User-group relationship*. A user an be in one or more groups, depending on the OS design decisions

>**NOTE**. The user's group IDs are also included in every associated process and thread

**Escalate privileges**. Required to gain extra permissions for an activity, e.g. access to a restricted device

## Concepts
**Main memory as a fast cache**. Main memory can be viewed as a fast cache for secondary storage
* *Explain*. 
    * Data in secondary storage must be copied into main memory for use
    * Data must be in main memory before being moved to secondary storage for safekeepin
