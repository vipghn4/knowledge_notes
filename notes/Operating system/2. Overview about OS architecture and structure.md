# 2. Overview about OS architecture and structure
## Operating system structure
**Operating system**. Provide the environment, within which programs are executed

### Multiprogramming
**Multiprogramming**. One of the most important aspect of OSes is the ability to multiprogram
* *Explain*. 
    * A single program cannot, in general, keep the CPU or the I/O devices busy at all times
    * Single users frequently have multiple programs running
    * Multiprogramming increases CPU utilization by organizing jobs, i.e. code and data
        
        $\to$ The CPU always has one to execute
* *Idea*. 
    * The OS keeps several jobs in memory simultaneously in job pool and main memory
    * The OS picks and begins to execute one of the jobs in memory
    * When the current job needs to wait for some task

        $\to$ The CPU is switched to another job
    * When the first job finishes waiting, the CPU gets back to this job
        
        $\to$ As long as at least one job needs to execute, the CPU is never idle
* *Pros*. 
    * Provide an environment, in which the various system resources are utilized effectively
    * No user interaction with the computer system is provided

* *Job pool*. Jobs are kept initially on the disk, in the job pool
    * *Explain*. Main memory is too small to accommodate all jobs
    * *Pool structure*. Consist of all processes residing on disk, awaiting allocation of main memory
* *From job pool to main memory*. The set of jobs in memory can be a subset of the jobs kept in the job pool

### Time sharing
**Time sharing**. Also called multitasking. A logical extension of multiprogramming
* *Description*. 
    * The CPU executes multiple jobs by switching among them
    * The switches occur so frequently that the users can interact with each program while it is running
* *Requirements*. An interactive, or hands-on, computer system, which provides direct communication between the user and the system
* *Work flow*.
    1. The user gives instructions to the OS, or to a program, directly, using a input device, e.g. keyboard
    2. The user waits for immediate results on an output device

        >**NOTE**. The response time should be short, typically less than 1 second
* *Pros*.
    * Allow many users to share the computer simultaneously
        * *Explain*. Each action or command in a the sytem tends to be short, that only a little CPU time is required for each user
    * Each user is given the impression that the entire computer system is dedicated to his use
        * *Explain*. The system switches rapidly from one user to the next

**Implementation of a time-shared OS**. The OS uses CPU scheduling and multiprogramming to provide each user with a small portion of a time-shared computer
* *Description*.
    * Each user has at least one separate program in memory, i.e. a process
    * When a process executes, it typically executes for only a short time before finishing or needing to perform I/O
* *User interaction and job switching*. I/O may be interactive, i.e. output goes to a display for user, and input comes from a user keyboard
    * *Consequence*. The OS will rapidly switch the CPU to the program of some other user
        * *Explain*. I/O typically runs at people speeds

### Problems in a time-shared OS
**Job scheduling**. Time sharing and multiprogramming require that several jobs are kept simultaneously in memory

$\to$ If several jobs are ready to be brought into memory, but there is not enough space, the OS must choose among them, i.e. job scheduling

**Memory management and CPU scheduling**. When the OS selects a job from the job pool, it loads the job into memory for execution
* *Memory management*. Having several programs in memory at the same time requires memory management
* *CPU scheduling*. If several jobs are ready to run at the same time

    $\to$ The system must choose among them

**Concurrency**. Running multiple jobs concurrently requires that their ability to affect one another be limited in all phases of the OS, i.e.
* Process scheduling
* Disk storage
* Memory management

**Swapping**. In a time-sharing system, the OS must ensure reasonable response time

$\to$ This is accomplished with swapping
* *Swapping*. Processes are swapped in and out of main memory to the disk

**Virtual memory**. A common method to ensure reasonable response time in a time-shared OS
* *Virtual memory*. A technique allowing the execution of a process, which is not completely in memory
* *Pros*. 
    * Enable users to run programs which are larger than actual physical memory
    * Abstract main memory into a large, uniform array of storage

        $\to$ This separates logical memory, as viewed by the user, from physical memory
    * Free programmers from concern over memory-storage limitations

**File system**. Time-sharing systems must also provide a file system
* *Disk management*. The file system resides on a collection of disks

    $\to$ Disk management must be provided

**Protection**. Time-sharing system must provide a mechanism for protecting resources from inappropriate use

**Job synchronization**. To ensure orderly execution

**Deadlock avoidance**

## Operating system operations
**Interrupt driven OSes**. Modern OSes are interrupt driven
* *System general structure*. The interrupt-driven nature of an OS defines that system's general structure
    * *Explain*. For each type of interrupt, separate segments of code in the OS determine what action should be taken

        $\to$ An interrupt service routine is provided, that is responsible for dealing with the interrupt

**Events, interrupt, and trap**. Events are almost alawyas signaled by the occurrence of an interrupt or a trap, i.e. an exception
* *Exception*. A software-generated interrupt caused by either an error, or by a specific request from a user program, which an OS service be performed

**Error and protection**. Since the OS and the users share the hardware and software resources of the computer

$\to$ An error in a user program should be able to cause problem only for the one program running
* *Challenge*. With sharing, many processes could be adversely affected by a bug in one program

    $\to$ Without protection, either the computer must execute only one process at a time, or all output must be suspect
* *Consequence*. A properly designed OS must ensure that an incorrect program cannot cause other programs to execute incorrectly

### Dual-mode operation
**Problem**. Distinguish between the execution of OS code and user-defined code
* *Most common solution*. Provide hardware support allowing us to differentiate among various modes of execution

**Modes of execution**. We need two separate modes of execution, i.e. *user mode* and *kernel mode* (also called *supervisor mode*, *system mode*, or *privileged mode*)

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/media/rb0JuI9.png">
    <figcaption>Transition from user to kernel mode</figcaption>
</div>

* *Mode bit*. A bit added to the hardware of the computer to indicate the current mode, i.e. kernel (0) or user (1)
    * *User mode*. When the computer is executing on behalf of a user application
    * *Kernel mode*. When a user application requests a service from the OS
* *Mode switching during computer execution*.
    1. At system boot time, the hardware starts in kernel mode
    2. The OS is loaded and starts the user application in user mode
    3. Whenever a trap or interrupt occurs

        $\to$ The hardware switches from user mode to kernel mode
        
    >**NOTE**. The system always switches to user mode before passing control to a user program

**Protection with dual-mode operation**. The dual mode of operation provides us with the means for protecting the OS from errant users
* *Privileged instructions*. We accomplish protection by designating some of the machine instructions, which may cause harm, as privileged instructions
    * *Example*. Switch to kernel mode, I/O control, timer management, interrupt management, etc.
    * *Mode of execution*. The hardware allows privileged instructions to be executed only in kernel mode

        >**NOTE**. If someone tries to execute a privileged instruction in user mode, the hardware does not execute the instruction
        >$\to$ The hardware treats the instruction as illegal and traps it to the OS

**Life cycle of instruction execution**. 
1. Initial control resides in the OS, where instructions are executed in kernel mode
2. When control is given to a user application

    $\to$ The mode is set to user mode
3. Control is switched back to the OS via an interrupt, a trap, or a system call

**System calls**. Provide the means for a user program to ask the OS to perform tasks reserved for the OS on the user program's behalf
* *Invocation*. A system call is invoked in variety of ways, depending on the functionality provided by the underlying processor
    * *Common idea*. There is a method used by a process to request action by the OS
    * *Common form of system calls*. A trap to a specifc location in the interrupt vector

        $\to$ This trap can be executed by a generic `trap` instruction
* *Execution of a system call*.
    1. When a system call is executed
        
        $\to$ It is treated by the hardware as a software interrupt
    2. Control passes through the interrupt vector to a service routine in the OS
    3. The mode bit is set to kernel mode
    4. The kernel examines the interrupting instruction to determine what system call has occured
        * *Inputs to the kernel*. 
            * A parameter indicating what type of service the user program is requesting
            * Additional information required for the request
                
                $\to$ This information may be passed in registers, on the stack, or in memory (with pointers to the memory locations passed in registers)
    5. The kernel verifies that the parameter are correct and legal, then executes the request
    6. The kernel returns control to the instruction following the system call

>**NOTE**. The system-call service routine is a part of the OS

**Consequences of lacking a hardware-supported dual mode**.
* A user program running awry can wipe out the OS by writing over it with data
* Multiple programs are able to write to a device at the same time, with potentially disastrous results

**Error handling**. Errors detected by hardware protection are normally handled by the OS
* If a user program fails in some way, e.g. illegal instruction, or illegal memory access, etc.

    $\to$ The hardware traps to the OS. The trap transfers control through the interrupt vector the the OS, just like an interrupt
* If a program error occurs, the OS must terminate the program abnormally

    $\to$ An appropriate error message is given, and the memory of the program may be dumped
    
    >**NOTE**. The memory dump is usually written to a file, so that the user or programmer can examine it

### Timer
**Timer**. A tool to ensure that the OS maintains control over the CPU
* *Explain*.  We cannot allow a user program to get stuck in an infinite loop, or to fail to call system services

    $\to$ The program may never return control to the OS
* *Functionality*. A timer can be set to interrupt the computer after a specified period

    >**NOTE**. The period may be fixed or variable

**Variable timer**. Generally implemented by a fixed-rate clock and a counter

>**NOTE**. The OS sets the counter

* *Functionality*.
    * Everytime the clock ticks, the counter is decremented
    * When the counter reaches 0, an interrupt occurs

**Control transfer**. 
* Before turning over control to the user, the OS ensures that the timer is set to interrupt
* If the timer interrupts

    $\to$ Control transfers automatically to the OS, which may treat the interrupt as a fatal error, or may give the program more time

>**NOTE**. Instructions modifying the content of the timer are privileged

**Preventing a user program from running too long**. Initialize a counter with the amount of time that a program is allowed to run

$\to$ If the timer counter reaches 0, the OS terminates the program for exceeding the assigned time limit
