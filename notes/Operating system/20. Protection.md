# Protection
**Motivation**. The processes in an OS must be protected from one another's activities

$\to$ We must ensure that only processes with proper authorization can operate on the files, memory segmets, CPU, and other system resources

**Protection**. Mechanisms for controlling the access of programs, processes, or users to the resources defined by a computer system

$\to$ These mechanisms must provide a mean for specifying the controls to be imposed, with a means of enforcement
* *Protection versus security*. Security is a measure of confidence that the integrity of a system and its data will be preserved

## Goals of protection
**Problem**. As computer systems have become more sophisticated and pervasive in their applications

$\to$ The need to protect their integrity has grown
* *Historical protection*. Considered as an adjunt to multiprogramming OSes
    * *Purposes*. Untrustworthy users may safely share a common logical name space, e.g. directory of files, or share a common physical name space
* *Modern protection*. Evolved to increase the reliability of any complex system making use of shared resources

**Reasons for protection**.
* *Reason 1*. Prevent the mischievous, intentional violation of an access restriction by a user

    $\to$ We need to ensure that each program component active in a system uses system resources only in ways consistent with stated policies
* *Reason 2*. For system reliability, i.e. by detecting latent errors at the interfaces between component subsystems
    * *Benefits of early detection of interface errors*.
        * Prevent contamination of a healthy subsystem by malfunctioning subsystem
        * An unprotected resource cannot defend against use, or misuse, by an unauthorized or incompetent user
        
            $\to$ A protection-oriented system provides means to distinguish between authorized and unauthorized usage
* *Reason 2*. Protection in a computer system provides a mechanism for the enforcement of the policies governing resource use

    >**NOTE**. A protection system must have the flexibility to enforce a variety of policies

**Policies for resource use**.
* *Policy establishment*.
    * *Option 1*. Some policies are fixed in the design of the system
    * *Option 2*. Some policies are formulated by the management of a system
    * *Option 3*. Some policies are defined by the individual users to protect their own files and programs
* *Dynamic policies*. Policies for resource use may vary by application, and they may change over time

    $\to$ Protection is no longer the concern solely of the designer of an OS, but the application programmer as well
    * *Application programmer and resource policy*. Programmers must use protection mechanisms to guard resources created and supported by an application subsystem against misuse

**Policy versus mechanism**. The separation of policy and mechanism is important for flexibility
* *Mechanism*. Determine how something will be done

    $\to$ Using general mechanisms enables us to avoid raid policy changes
* *Policy*. Determine what will be done

    $\to$ Policies are likely to change from place to place, or time to time

## Principles of protection
**Principles of protection**. Simplify design decisions and keep the system consistent and easy to understand
* *Principle of least priviledge*. A key, time-tested guiding principle for protection
    * *Idea*. Programs, users, and eve systems should be given just enough priviledges to perform their tasks

**OS with the principle**. 
* Its features, programs, system calls, and data structures are implementedso that
    * Failure or compromise of a component does the minimum damage
    * Allow the minimum damage to be done
        * *Example*. The overflow of a buffer in a system daemon may cause the daemon process to fail

            $\to$ But this should not allow the execution of code from the daemon process' stack, which would enable a remote user to gain maximum priviledges and access to the entire system
* The OS provides system calls and services allowing applications to be written with fine-grained access controls
* The OS provides mechanisms to enable priviledges when they are required, and to disable them when they are not needed
* The OS creates audit trails for all priviledged function access

    $\to$ The audit trails allows the programmer, system administrator, or law-enforcement officer to trace all protection and security activities on the system

**User management with the principle**. A separate account for each user is created, with just the priviledges that the user needs
* *Role-based access control (RBAC)*. Some systems implement RBAC to provide this functionality

**Computers implemented in a computing facility with the principle**. Limited to running specific services, accessing specific remote hosts via specific services, and doing so during specific times
* *Implementation*. These restrictions are typically implemented through enabling or disabling each service, and through using access control lists

**Computing environment with the principle**.
* *Windows*. Have a complex protection scheme at its core, and yet many security holes
    * *Explain*. 
        * Windows has more lines of code and more services than Solaris and hence more to secure and protect
        * The protection scheme in Windows is incomplete or protects the wrong aspects of the OS, leaving other areas vulnerable
* *Solars*. Relatively secure, even though it is a variant of UNIX which historically designed with little protection in mind

## Domain of protection
**Computer system**. A collection of processes and objects, i.e. hardware objects (CPU, memory segments, etc.) and software objects (files, programs, etc.)

**Objects**. Essentially abstract data types
* *Object identifier*. Each object has a unique name differentiating it from all other objects in the system
* *Object access*. Each object can be accessed only through well-defined and meaningful operations
* *Operations on objects*. Possible operations may depend on the object

**Processes**.
* *Access to resources*.
    * A process should be allowed to access only resources, for which it has authorization
    * A process should be able to access only those resources, which it currently requires to complete its task, at any time

        $\to$ This is need-to-know principle, i.e. useful in limiting the amount of damage a faulty process can cause in the system
* *Examples*. When process $p$ invokes procedure $A()$
    
    $\to$ The procedure should be allowed to access only its own variables, and the formal parameters passed to it

### Domain structure
**Protection domain**. To facilitate the protection of computer systems

$\to$ A process operates within a protection domain, which specifies the resources that the process may access
* *Protection domain*. Each domain defines a set of objects and the type of operations, which may be invoked on each object
* *Access right*. The ability to execute an operation on an object

    $\to$ A domain is a collection of access rights, each of which is an ordered pair $\langle \ce{object-name}, \ce{rights-set} \rangle$
* *Overlapping domain*. Domains do not need to be disjoint, i.e. they may share access rights
    * *Example*. Consider three domains, i.e. $D_1,D_2,D_3$

        $\to$ The access right $\langle \ce{O_4, print} \rangle$ is shared by $D_2$ and $D_3$

        <div style="text-align:center">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/PgwJb5E.png">
            <figcaption>System with overlapping domains</figcaption>
        </div>

        * *Consequence*. A process executing in either of these two domains can print object $O_4$

**Process-domain binding**. The association between a process and a domain may be static or dynamic
* *Static binding*. The set of resources available to the process is fixed throughout the process' lifetime
    * *Static binding and need-to-know principle*. If we want to adhere to the need-to-know principle amid static binding

    $\to$ A mechanism must be available to change the content of a domain
        * *Explain*. A process may execute in two different phases and may, for example, need read access in one phase and write access in another phase
            * If a domain is static, we must define the domain to include both read and write access

                $\to$ This arrangement provides more rights than needed in each of the two phases, violating the need-to-know principle
            * Hence, we must allow the contents of a domain to be modified, so that the domain always reflects the minimum necessary acess rights
* *Dynamic binding*. Establishing dynamic protection domains is more complicated than establishing static protection domains
    * *Dynamic binding and need-to-know principle*. A mechanism is available to allow domain switching, enabling the process to switch from one domain to another
        * *Domain modification*. We still want to allow the content of a domain to be changed
            * *Explain*. If we cannot change the content of a domain

                $\to$ We can provide the same effect by creating a new domain with the changed content, and switching to the new domain when needed

**Domain realization**.
* *Option 1*. Each user may be a domain, i.e. the set of objects can be accessed depends on the identity of the user

    $\to$ Domain switching occurs when the user is changed, i.e. generally when one user logs out and another logs in
* *Option 2*. Each process may be a domain, i.e. the set of objects can be accessed depends on the identity of the process

    $\to$ Domain switching occurs when one process sends a message to another, then waits for a response
* *Option 3*. Each procedure may be a domain, i.e. the set of objects can be accessed corresponds to the local variables within the procedure

    $\to$ Domain switching occurs when a procedure call is made

### Example - UNIX
**Protection domain in UNIX**. A domain is associated with the user

$\to$ Switching the domain corresponds to changing the user identification temporarily
* *Domain change implementation*. Exploit the file system as follows
    * *Owner identification and domain bit*. An owner identification and a domain bit, i.e. `setuid` bit, are associated with each file
        * When the setuid bit is on, and a user executes the file

            $\to$ The user ID is set to that of the owner of the file
        * When the bit is off, the user ID does not change
    * *Example*. Consider a user A starts executing a file owned by B
        * If the domain bit is off, the user ID of the process is set to A
        * If the domain bit is on, the user ID of the process is set to B
        
    >**NOTE**. When the process exits, this temporary user ID change ends

    >**NOTE**. Other methods are used to change domains in OSes, in which user IDs are used for domain definition, since almost all systems need to provide such a mechanism

* *Purpose*. This mechanism is used when a priviledged facility needs to be made available to the general user population
    * *Example*. It may be desirable to allow users to access a network without letting them write their own networking programs
    * *Solution*. On a UNIX system, the setuid bit on a networking program would be set, causing the user ID to change when the program was run

        $\to$ The user ID changes to that of a user with network access priviledge, e.g. root user
    * *Drawback*. If a user manages to create a file with user ID root, and with its setuid bit on

        $\to$ That user can become root and do anything and everything on the system

**Alternative to UNIX's method**. Place priviledged programs in a special directory

$\to$ The OS would be designed to change the user ID of any program run from this directory, either to the equivalent of root, or to the user ID of the directory owner
* *Pros*. This eliminates a security problem with setuid programs, in which crackers create and hide such programs for later use
* *Cons*. Less flexible than that used by UNIX

**A more restrictive and protective method**. The system does not allow a change of user ID

$\to$ Special techniques must be used to allow users access to priviledged facilities
* *Example*. A daemon process may be started at boot time, and run as a special user ID

    $\to$ Users then run a separate program sending requests to the daemon process whenever they need to use the facilitiy

**Writing priviledged programs**. In any system, great care must be taken in writing priviledged programs

$\to$ Any oversight can result in a total lack of protection on the system
* *Explain*. Generally, these programs are the first to be attacked by people trying to break into a system

    $\to$ Unfortunately, the attackers are frequently successful
* *Example*. Security has been breached on many UNIX systems due to setuid feature

### Example - MULTICS
**Ring structured protection domains**. In the MULTICS system, the protection domains are organized hierarchically into a ring structure

$\to$ Each ring corresponds to a domain

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/e2nyF5M.png">
    <figcaption>MULTICS ring structure</figcaption>
</div>

* *Ring relationships*. Consider any two rings $D_i$ and $D_j$, where $i$ and $j$ are indices of the rings
    
    $\to$ If $j<i$, then $D_i$ is a subset of $D_j$, i.e. a process executing in $D_j$ has more priviledges than does process executing in $D_i$
    * *Consequence*. $D_0$ has the most priviledges
* *Special case*. If only two rings exist, this scheme is equivalent to the monitor-user mode of execution

**Address space in MULTICS**. MULTICS has a segmented address space, where each segment is a file, and each segment is associated with one of the rings
* *Segment description*. Include
    * An entry identifying the ring number
    * Three access bits to control reading, writing, and execution

>**NOTE**. The association between segments and rings is a policy decision, with which we are not concerned here

**Current-ring-number counter**. Associated with each process, to identify the ring, in which the process is currently executing
* *Idea*. When a process is executing in ring $i$
    * It cannot access a segment associated with ring $j<i$
    * It can accesss a segment associated with ring $k\geq i$
    * The type of access is restricted according to the access bits associated with the segment

**Domain switching in MULTICS**. Occur when a process crosses from one ring to another, by calling a procedure in a different ring
* *Controlled domain switching*. The switch must be done in a controlled manner
    
    $\to$ Otherwise, a process could start executing in ring 0, and no protection would be provided
* *Modification of segment descriptor*. To allow controlled domain switching, we modify the ring field of the segment descriptor to include the following
    * *Access bracket*. A pair of integers $b_1,b_2$ so that $b_1\leq b_2$
    * *Limit*. An integer $b_3>b_2$
    * *List of gates*. Identify the entry points, or gates, at which segments may be called
* *Domain switching*. If a process executing in ring $i$ calls a procedure, or segment, with access bracket $(b_1,b_2)$
    * If $b_1\leq i\leq b_2$, and the current ring number of process remains $i$, then the call is allowed
    * Otherwise, a trap to the OS occurs, and the situation is handled as follows
        * If $i<b_1$, then the call is allowed to occur, since we have a transfer to a ring, or domain, with fewer priviledges

            >**NOTE**. If passed parameters refer to segments in a lower ring, then these segments must be copied into an area acceessible to the called procedure
        
        * If $i>b_2$, then the call is allowed to occur only if $b_3\geq i$, and the call has been directed to one of the designated entry points in the list of gates

            $\to$ This allows processes with limited access rights to call procedures in lower rings with more access rights, but only in a carefully controlled manner

**Drawback of rings**. 
* It does not allow us to enforce the need-to-know principle
    * *Explain*. If an object must be accessible in domain $D_j$ but not accessible in domain $D_i$

        $\to$ We must have $j<i$, but this means that every segment accessible in $D_i$ is also accessible in $D_j$
* The MULTICS protection system is generally more complex and less efficient than those in current OSes

    $\to$ If protection interferes with the ease of use of the system, or significantly decreases system performance, then its use must be weighted carefully against the purpose of the system

## Access matrix
**Access matrix**. Our model of protection can be viewed abstractly as an access matrix
* *Access matrix*. The rows of the access matrix represent domains, and the columns represent objects
    * *Matrix entry*. Each entry in the matrix consists of a set of access rights
        * *Explain*. The entry access $(i,j)$ defines the set of operations that a process executing in domain $D_i$ can invoke on object $O_j$

**Protection policy decisions**. Can be implemented by the access matrix
* *Policy decisions*. Involve which rights should be included in the $(i,j)$-th entry
    * *Idea*. 
        * When a user creates a new object $O_j$
            
            $\to$ The column $O_j$ is added to the access matrix with the appropriate initialization entries, as given by the creator
        * The user may decide to enter some rights in some entries in column $j$, and other rights in other entries, as needed
* *Process execution domain decisions*. Usually decided by the OS
    
    $\to$ The users normally decide the contents of the access-matrix entries

**Strict control definition and implementation for static and dynamic process-domain association**. Appropriate mechanisms are provided by the access matrix
* *Domain switch*. When we switch a process from one domain to another, we are executing an operation, i.e. `switch`, on an object, i.e. the domain
    
    $\to$ We can control domain switching by including domains among the objects of the access matrix
    * *Explain*. Switching from $D_i$ and $D_j$ is allowed if and only if

        $$\text{switch}\in\text{access}(i,j)$$

* *Access matrix content change*. When we do this, we are performing an operation on an object, i.e. the access matrix

    $\to$ We can control these changes by including the access matrix as an object itself
    
    >**NOTE**. Since each entry in the access matrix can be modified individually, we must consider each entry as an object to be protected

    * *Explain*. Allowing controlled change in the contents of the access-matrix entries requires additiona operations, i.e. `copy`, `owner`, and `control`

* *Consequence*. We need to consider only the operations possible on the new objects, i.e. domains and the access matrix, and decide processes should execute these operations

**`copy`, `owner`, and `control` rights on access matrix**.
* *`copy` right*. The ability to copy an access right from one domain, i.e. row, of the access matrix to another
    * *Notation*. Denoted by $*$ appended to the access right
    * *Copy right*. Allow the access right to be copied only within the column, i.e. for the object, for which the right is defined
    * *Variants*.
        * *`transfer`*. If a right is copied from $\text{access}(i, j)$ to $\text{access}(k, j)$, it is then removed from $\text{access}(i, j)$
            
            $\to$ This is a transfer of a right, rather than a copy
        * *`limited-copy`*. Propagation of the copy right may be limited, i.e. when the right $R∗$ is copied from $\text{access}(i, j)$ to $\text{access}(k, j)$, only the right $R$, not $R∗$, is created

            $\to$ A process executing in domain $D_k$ cannot further copy the right $R$
* *`owner` right*. We need a mechanism to allow addition of new rights and removal of some rights

    $\to$ The `owner` right controls these operations
    * *Explain*. If access(i, j) includes the `owner` right
        
        $\to$ A process executing in domain $D_i$ can add and remove any right in any entry in column $j$
* *`control` right*. Needed to change the entries in a row, i.e. the `control` right is applicable only to domain objects
    * *Explain*. If access(i, j) includes the `control` right
        
        $\to$ A process executing in domain Di can remove any access right from row $j$

**Confinement problem**. The problem of guaranteeing that no information initially held in an object can migrate outside of its execution environment

$\to$ This problem is in generall unsolvable
* *Motivation*. The `copy` and `owner` rights provide us with a mechanism to limit the propagation of access rights

    $\to$ But thye do not give us the appropriate tools for preventing the propagation, or disclosure, of information

## Implementation of access matrix
**Problem**. In general, the matrix will be sparse, i.e. most of the entries will be empty

$\to$ Although data structure techniques are available for sparse matrices representation, they are not useful for this application
* *Explain*. Due to the way in which protection facility is used

    $\to$ This section describes several methods of implementing the access matrix and compare the methods

### Global table
**Global table**. The simplest implementation o the access matrix
* *Idea*. Use a global table consisting a set of ordered triples $\langle \text{domain}, \text{object}, \text{right-set} \rangle$
* *Operation execution*. When a operation $M$ is executed on an object $O_j$ within domain $D_i$
    1. The global stable is searched for a triple $\langle D_i,O_j,R_k \rangle$ with $M\in R_k$
    2. If the triple is found, the operation is allowed to continue, otherwise, an exception condition is raised
* *Drawbacks*.
    * The table is usually large and hence cannot be kept in main memory

        $\to$ Additional I/O is required, i.e. virtual-memory techniques are often used for managing this table
    * It is difficult to take advantage of special groups of objects or domains

### Access lists for objects
**Access lists**. Each column in the access matrix is implemented as an access list for one object, and empty entries can be discarded

$\to$ The resulting list for each object consists of ordered pairs $\langle \text{domain}, \text{right-set} \rangle$ defining all domains with a nonempty set of access rights for that object
* *Expansion*. This approach can be extended easily to define a list plus a default set of access rights
* *Operation execution*. When an operation $M$ on an object $O_j$ is attempted in $D_i$
    1. We search the access list for $O_j$, looking for $\langle D_i, R_k \rangle$ with $M\in R_k$
    2. If the entry is found, the operation is allowed, otherwise, we check the default set

        >**NOTE**. For efficiency, we may check the default set first, then search the access list

    3. If $M$ is in the default set, we allow the access, otherwise, access is denied, and an exception condition occurs

### Capability lists for domains
**Capability lists for domains**. We can associate each row with its domain, rather than associating the columns of the access matrix with the object
* *Capability list for a domain*. A list of objects, together with the operations allowed on those objects
    * *Object representation*. An object is represented by its physical name or address, i.e. a capability
* *Operation execution*. To execution operation $M$ on object $O_j$

    $\to$ The process executes $M$, specifying the capability, or pointer, for object $O_j$ as parameter
    * *Possession of the capability*. Mean that access is allowed

**Access to capability list**. The capability list is associated with a domain, but it is never directly accessible to a process executing in that domain

$\to$ The capability list is itself a protected object, maintained by the OS and accessed by the user only indirectly
* *Capability-based protection*. Rely on the fact that the capabilities are never allowed to migrate into any address space directly accessible by a user process, where they could be modified

    $\to$ If all capabilities are secure, the object they protect is also secure against unauthorized access

**Inherent protection with capabilities**.
* *Historical motivation*. Capabilities were originally proposed as a kind of secure pointer, to meet the need for resource protection, which was foreseen as multiprogrammed computer systems came of age
    
    $\to$ The idea of inherently protected pointer provides a foundation for protection, which can be extended to the applications level
* *Providing inherent protection*. To do this, we must distinguish capabilities from other kinds of objects, and the must be interpreted by an abstract machine, on which high-level programs run

    $\to$ Capabilities are usually distinguished from other data in one or two ways
    * *Option 1*. Each object has a tag to denote whether it is a capability or accessible data
        * *Accessibility of tags*. The tags must not be directly accessible by any application program

            $\to$ This is enforced by hardware or firmware support
        * *Tag structure*. Although onl one bit is required for a tag, more bits may be used

            $\to$ This allows all objects to be tagged with their types by the hardware
            * *Consequence*. The hardware can distinguish integers, floating-point numbers, pointers, Booleans, characters, instructions, capabilities, and uninitialized values, by their tags
    * *Option 2*. The address space associated with a program can be split into two parts
        * One part accessible to the program and containing the program's normal data and instructions
        * One part accessible only by the OS and containing the capability list

            $\to$ A segmented memory space is useful to support this approach

### A lock-key mechanism
**Lock-key mechanism**. A compromise between access lists and capability lists
* *Idea*.
    * Each object has a list of unique bit patterns, i.e. locks

        $\to$ This list is managed by the OS, on behalf of the domain
    * Each domain has a list of unique bit patterns, i.e. keys

        $\to$ This list is managed by the OS, on behalf of the domain
* *Operation execution*. A process executing in a domain can access an object only if the domain has a key matching one of the object's locks

### Comparison
**Brief analysis**. Choosing a technique for implementing an access matrix involves various trade-offs
* *Global table*. Simple yet inefficient, i.e. the table can be large and often cannot take advantage of special groupings of objects or domains
* *Access lists*. 
    * *Pros*. Correspond directly to the need of users, i.e. when creating an object, the user can specify which domains can access the object, and which operations are allowed
    * *Cons*. 
        * Access-rights information for a particular domain is not localized

            $\to$ Determining the set of access rights for ehach domain is difficult
        * Every access to the object must be checked, requiring a search of the access list

            $\to$ This is time-consuming in large systems
* *Capability lists*.
    * *Pros*. Useful for localizing information for a given process
        * *Explain*. The process attempting access must present a capability for the access

            $\to$ The protection system needs only to verify that the capability is valid
    * *Cons*. 
        * Do not respond directly to the needs of users
        * Revocation of capabilities may be inefficient, i.e. since we need to iterate through domains
* *Lock-key mechanism*.
    * The mechanism can be both effective and flexible, depending on the length of the keys
    * The keys can be passed freely from domain to domain
    * Access priviledges can be effectively revoked by the simple technique of changing some of the locks associated with the objects

**Practical applications**. Most systems use a combination of access lists and capabilities
* *Idea*. 
    1. When a process first tries to access an object, the access list is searched
    2. If access is denied, an exception occurs, otherwise, a capability is created and attached to the process
    3. Additional references use the capability to demonstrate swiftly that access is allowed
    4. After the last access, the capability is destroyed

## Access control
**Role-based access control (RBAC)**. Solaris 10 advances the protection available in the Sun Microsystems OS by adding the principle of least priviledges via RBAC
* *Priviledge*. The right to execute a system call, or to use an option within that system call, e.g. opening a file with write access

    $\to$ Priviledges can be assigned to processes, limiting them to exactly the access they need to perform their work
* *Roles*. Priviledges and programs can be assigned to roles

    $\to$ Users are assigned roles or can take roles based on passwords to the roles
    * *Consequence*. A user can take a role enabling a priviledge, allowing the user to run a program to accomplish a task

        $\to$ This decreases the security risk associated with superusers and setuid programs

## Revocation of access rights
**Revocation of access rights**. In a dynamic protection system, we may want to revoke access rights to objects shared by different users
* *Revocation-related problems*.
    * *Immediate versus delayed*. 
        * Does revocation occur immediately, or is it delayed? 
        * If revocation is delayed, can we find out when it will take place?
    * *Selective versus general*. When an access right to an object is revoked
        * Does it affect all the users who have an access right to that object, or
        * Can we specify a select group of users whose access rights should be revoked?
    * *Partial versus total*. 
        * Can a subset of the rights associated with an object be revoked, or 
        * Must we revoke all access rights for this object?
    * *Temporary versus permanent*. 
        * Can access be revoked permanently, i.e. the revoked access right will never again be available, or
        * Can access be revoked and later be obtained again?

**Revocation with access-list scheme**. Revocation is easy, i.e. the access list is searched for any access rights to be revoked

$\to$ They are deleted from the list
* *Consequence*. Revocation is immediate and can be general or selective, total or partial, and permanent or temporary

**Revocation with capabilities**. Capabilities present a much more difficult revocation problem
* *Explain*. The capabilities are distributed throughout the
system

    $\to$ We must find them before we can revoke them
* *Revocation schemes for capabilities*.
    * *Reacquisition*. Periodically, capabilities are deleted from each domain, i.e.
        1. If a process wants to use a capabilityit may find that that capability has been deleted
        2. The process may then try to reacquire the capability
        3. If access has been revoked, the process will not be able to reacquire the capability
    * *Back-pointers*. A list of pointers is maintained with each object, pointing to all capabilities associated with that object
        
        $\to$ When revocation is required, we can follow these pointers, changing the capabilities as necessary
        * *Pros and cons*. It is quite general, but its implementation is costly
    * *Indirection*. The capabilities point indirectly to the objects
        
        $\to$ Each capability points to a unique entry in a global table pointing to the object
        * *Revocation implementation*. 
            1. Search the global table for the desired entry and deleting it
            2. When an access is attempted, the capability is found to point to an illegal table entry
        * *Pros*. Table entries can be reused for other capabilities without difficulty
            * *Explain*. Both the capability and the table entry contain the unique name of the object
                
                >**NOTE**. The object for a capability and its table entry must match
        
        * *Cons*. It does not allow selective revocation.
    * *Keys*. A key is a unique bit pattern that can be associated with a capability
        
        $\to$ This key is defined when the capability is created
        * *Access to keys*. Keys can be neither modified nor inspected by the process that owns the capability
        * *Master key*. A master key is associated with each object
            
            $\to$ It can be defined or replaced with the `set-key` operation
        * *Capability and key*. 
            * When a capability is created, the current value of the master key is associated with the capability
            * When the capability is exercised, its key is compared with the master key
                * If the keys match, the operation is allowed to continue
                * Otherwise, an exception condition is raised
        * *Capability revocation*. Replace the master key with a new value via the `set-key` operation
            
            $\to$ The new key invalidates all previous capabilities for this object
        * *Cons*. selective revocation is not allowed, since only one master key is associated with each object
            
            $\to$ If we associate a list of keys with each object, then selective revocation can be implemented
        * Global key table*. We can group all keys into one global table of keys
            
            $\to$ A capability is valid only if its key matches some key in the global table
            * *Revocation implementation*. Remove the matching key from the table
                * *Consequence*. A key can be associated with several objects, and several keys can be associated with each object
                    
                    $\to$ This provides maximum flexibility
        * *Access to key definition, inserting, and deletion operations*. These operations should not be available to all users
            
            $\to$ It would be reasonable to allow only the owner of an object to set the keys for that object
