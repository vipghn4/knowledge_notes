# Protection
**Motivation**. The processes in an OS must be protected from one another's activities

$\to$ We must ensure that only processes with proper authorization can operate on the files, memory segmets, CPU, and other system resources

**Protection**. Mechanisms for controlling the access of programs, processes, or users to the resources defined by a computer system

$\to$ These mechanisms must provide a mean for specifying the controls to be imposed, with a means of enforcement
* *Protection versus security*. Security is a measure of confidence that the integrity of a system and its data will be preserved
