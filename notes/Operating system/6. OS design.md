# 6. OS design
## Operating-system design and implementation
### Design goals
**First problem*. Defining goals and specifications**.
* *Highest level*. Choice of hardware and the type of system, i.e. batch, time shared, single user, multiuser, distributed, real time, or general purpose
* *Lower level*. Specify the requirements
    * *User goals*. The system should be convenient to use, easy to learn and to use, reliable, safe, and fast
    * *System goals*.
        * The system should be easy to design, implement, and maintain
        * The system should be flexible, reliable, error free, and efficient

    >**NOTE**. Specifying and designing an OS is a highly creative task

**Second problem*. Mechanisms and policies**.
* *Separation of policy from mechanism*. Important for flexibility
    * *Explain*. Policies are likely to change across places or over time

        $\to$ In the worst case, each change in policy would require a change in the underlying mechanism
    * *Terminologies*.
        * *Mechanisms*. Determine how to do something, e.g. time construct is a mechanism for ensuring CPU protection
        * *Policies*. Determine what will be done, e.g. deciding how long the timer is to be set for a particular user
    * *Desired system*. A general mechanism insensitive to policy changes

>**NOTE**. Policy decisions are important for all resource allocation
>* *Explain*. Whenever it is necessary to decide whether or not to allocate a resource, a policy must be made

### Implementation
>**NOTE**. Now, OSes are most commonly written in higher-level languages like C/C++, rather than assembly languages
>* *Example*. Linux is written mostly in C

**Performance of OSes**.
* Major performance improvements in OSes are more likely to be the result of better data structures and algorithms, than of excellent assembly-language code
* Despite of the large sizes of OSes, only a small amount of the code is critical to high performance

    >**NOTE**. The memory manager and the CPU scheduler are probably the most critical routines

    >**NOTE**. After the system is written and is working correctly, bottleneck routines can be identified and can be replaced with assembly-language equivalents

## Operating system structure
**OS implementation**. A system as large and complex as a modern operating system must be engineered carefully if it is to function properly and be modified easily
* *A common approach*. Partition the task into small components rather than having one monolithic system
    * *Module definition*. Each of the modules should be a well-defined portion of the system, with carefully defined inputs, outputs, and functions

    >**NOTE**. Many commercial OSes do not have well-defined structures, since they are small, simple, and limited systems

### Layered approach
**Motivation**. With proper hardware support, OSes can be broken into pieces, which are smaller and more appropriate

</div>

**Layered approach**. The OS is broken into a number of layers, i.e. levels, indexed from $0$, i.e. hardware, to $N$, i.e. user interface
* *OS layer*. An implementation of an abstract object made up of data and the oprations to manipulate these data
    * *Typical OS layer*. Consist of data structures and a set of routines which can be invoked by higher-level layers

        $\to$ Layer $M$, in turn, can invoke operations on lower-level layers

**Pros and cons**.
* *Pros*.
    * The simplicity of construction and debugging
        * *Explain*.
            * The layers are selected so that each uses functions and services of only lower-level layers
            * The first layer can be debugged without any concern for the rest of the system, since it uses only the basic hardware

                $\to$ Once the first layer is debugged, its correct functioning can be assumed while the second layer is debugged
    * Information hiding, i.e. each layer is implemented with only operations provided by lower-level layers without knowing the explicit implementation of those operations

        $\to$ Each layer hides the existence of certain data structures, operations, and hardware from higher-level layers
* *Cons*.
    * Difficult to appropriately define the various layers
        * *Explain*. A layer can use only lower-level layers, thus careful planning is required
    * Layered approach tends to be less efficient than other types
        * *Explain*. At each layer, the parameters may be modified, data may be passed, etc. Thus each layer adds overhead to the system call

            $\to$ A system call takes longer than ones on a nonlayered system

>**NOTE**. The limitations of layered approach caused a small backlash against layering in recen years

### Microkernels
**Motivation**. As UNIX expanded, the kernel became large and difficult to manage

$\to$ We need modularization, i.e. microkernel

**Microkernel approach**. Structure the OS by removing all nonessential components from the kernel, and implement them as system and user-level programs

$\to$ This results in smaller kernel
* *Design objective*. Provide minimal process and memory management, in addition to a communication facility
* *Microkernel*. The main function is to provide a communication facility between the client program and the various services, which are also running in the user space
    * *Communication method*. Message passing
    * *Example*. If the client program wants to access a file, it must interact with the file server

    >**NOTE**. The client program and service never interact directly
    >$\to$ They communicate indirectly by exchanging messages with the microkernel

**Pros and cons**.
* *Pros*.
    * Easy to extend the OS, i.e. all new services are added to user space and consequently do not require modification of the kernel
    * When the kernel is modified, the changes tend to be fewer, since microkernel is a smaller kernel

        $\to$ The resulting OS is easier to port from one hardware design to another
    * More security and reliability, since most services are running as user, rather than kernel, processes

        $\to$ If a service fails, the rest of the OS remains untouched
* *Cons*. Suffer from performance decreases due to increased system function overhead

### Modules
**Motivation**. The best current methodology for OS design involves using OOP techniques to create a modular kernel

**Modules**. The kernel has a set of core components and links in additional services during boot time or during run time
* *Example*. We can organize the OS around a core kernel with the following types of loadable kernel modules
    * Scheduling classes
    * File systems
    * Loadable system calls
    * Executable formats
    * STREAMS modules
    * Miscellaneous
    * Device and bus drivers

# Appendix
## Case study
**Original UNIX OS**. UNIX initially was limited by hardware functionality

    <figcaption>Traditional UNIX system structure</figcaption>
</div>

* *OS structure*.
    * UNIX consists of two separable parts, i.e. the kernel and the system programs
    * The kernel is further separated into a series of interfaces and device drivers, which have been added and expanded over time

## Concepts
**Dynamically loadable modules**. Modules which can be loaded during runtime or boot tim
