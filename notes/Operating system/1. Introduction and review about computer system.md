# 1. Introduction and review about computer system
**Operating system**. A program which manages the computer hardware
* *Roles*.
    * Provide a basis for application programs
    * Act as an intermediary between the computer user and the computer hardware
* *Objective of OS design*. Produce convenient and efficient OS

## What OSes do
**Computer system**. 
* *Four-component view*. Consist of the hardware, the OS, the application programs, and the users 
    * *Hardware*. The CPU, memory, and the I/O devices
        * *Role*. Provide the basic computing resources for the system
    * *Application programs*. Word processors, compilers, etc.
        * *Role*. Define the ways, in which the resources are used to solve users' computing problems
    * *Operating system*.
        * *Role*. Control the hardware and coordinates its use among the various application programs for the various users
* *Three-component view*. Consist of hardware, software, and data
    * *Operating system*. Provide the means for proper use of the resources in the operation of the computer system
        $\to$ The OS is similar to a government, i.e. it performs no useful function by itself, but provides an environment, within which other programs can do useful work

### OS from user view
**Computer system from user view**. Vary according to the interface being used

**Personal computer**. Users sit in front of a PC consisting of a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and system unit
* *Computer system design objective*. Monopolize computing resources, to maximize the work performed by the user
* *OS design objective*. 
    * *Objectives*.
        * Mainly designed for the ease of use
        * Some attention paid to performance
        * None paid to resource utilization
    * *Explain*. Performance is important to the user, but the system is optimized for the single-user experience rather than the requirements of multiple users

**Mainframe computer**. A user sits at a terminal connected to a mainframe or a minicomputer. Other users are accessing the same computer through other terminals

$\to$ These users share resources and may exchange information
* *OS design objective*. Maximize resource utilization

    $\to$ To assure that all available CPU time, memory, and I/O are used efficiently, and no individual user takes more than her fair share

**Workstation**. Users sit at a work stations connected to networks of other workstations and servers

$\to$ These users have dedicated resources at their disposal, but they also share resources, e.g. networking and server
* *OS design objective*. Compromise between individual usability and resource utilization

**Standalone devices**. The computer system is a standalone unit for an individual users
* *OS design objective*. Focus on individual usability, and performance per unit of battery life

**Embedded computers**. The computer system has little or no user view, e.g. embedded computers
* *OS design objective*. Design primarily to run without user intervention

### OS from system view
**OS as a resource allocator**. The program most intimately involved with the hardware

$\to$ An OS is a resource allocator
* *Explain*. The OS manages the computing resources
* *OS role*. It faces numerous and possibly conflicting requests for resources

    $\to$ It must decide how to allocate the resources to specific programs and users
* *OS objective*. Operate the computer system efficiently and fairly

**OS as a control program**. The OS needs to control the various I/O devices and the user programs
* *OS objective*. FOcus on the operation and control of I/O devices

### Defining OSes
**OS**. The common functions of controlling and allocating resources are brought together into the OS

>**NOTE**. There is no complete adequate definition of an OS

**A simple viewpoint about the OS**. The OS includes everything a vendor ships when we order "the OS"

$\to$ The features included vary greatly across systems

**A more common definition of the OS**. The program running at all times on the computer

$\to$ In this case, the OS is usually called **the kernel**

>**NOTE**. Along with the kernel, there are two other types of programs
>* *System programs*. Associated with the OS, but are not part of the kernel
>* *Application programs*. Include all programs not associated with the operation of the system

## Computer system organization
### Computer system operation

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/media/j1Cx0Cs.png">
    <figcaption>A modern computer system</figcaption>
</div>

**Modern general-purpose computer system**.
* *Main components*. 
    * One or more CPUs
    * A number of device controllers connected through a common bus
        * Each device controller is in charge of a specific type of device, e.g. disk drivers, etc.
        * The common bus provides access to shared memory
* *Memory controller*. The CPU and the device controllers can execute concurrently, competing the memory cycles

    $\to$ A memory controller, whose function is to synchronize access to the memory, is provided to ensure orderly access to the shared memory
* *Boostrap program*. For a computer to start running, it needs to have an initial program to run when it is powered up
    * *Location*. Bootstrap program is stored in a firmware, within the computer hardware
    * *Functionality*. Initialize all aspects of the system, from CPU registers to device controllers to memory contents, i.e.
        1. The boostrap program locates and loads into memory the OS kernel

            $\to$ So that it knows how to load the OS and how to start executing the system
        2. The OS starts executing the first process, e.g. `init`, and waits for some event to occur

**Events and interrupts**.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/media/nIsiPPc.png">
    <figcaption>Interrupt timeline for a single process doing output</figcaption>
</div>

* *Events and interrupts*. The occurrence of an event is usually signaled by an interrupt from the hardware or the software
    * *Hardware interrupts*. Triggered at anytime by sending a signal to the CPU, usually by way of the system bus
    * *Software interrups*. Triggered by the software executing a special operation called *a system call*, or *monitor call*
* *Handling interrupts*. 
    1. When the CPU is interrupted, it stops the current work and immediately transfers execution to a fixed location
        
        $\to$ This location contains the starting address, where the service routine for the interrupt is located 
    2. The interrupt service routine executes
    3. On completion, the CPU resumes the interrupted computation

>**NOTE**. Interrupts are an important part of a computer architecture

* *Interrupt mechanism*. Each computer design has its interrupt mechanism, but several functions are common
    * *Interrupt control transfer*. The interrupt must transfer control to the appropriate interrupt service routine

        $\to$ The routine will call the interrupt-specific handler
        
        * *Example transfer*. Invoke a generic routine to examine the interrupt information
    * *Interrupt handler*. Interrupts must be handled quickly
        
        $\to$ This leads to the user of interrupt vector
        
    * *Interrupt vector*. Since only a predefined number of interrupts is possible

        $\to$ A table of pointers to interrupt routines can be used, to provide necessary speed
        * *Usage of interrupt vector*. Hold the addresses of the interrupt service routines for various devices
        * *Location in memory*. The table is stored in low memory, i.e. the first hundred or so locations
        * *Pros*. The interrupt routine is called indirectly through the table, without intermediate routine required
        * *Other characteristics*.
            * *Indexing*. The table is indexed by a unique device number, given with the interrupt request
                $\to$ To provide the address of the interrupt service routine for the interrupting device
    * *Saving interrupted instruction address*. 
        * *Old designs*. Save the interrupt address in a fixed location, or in a location indexed by the device number
        * *Recent designs*. Store the interrupt address on the system stack
    * *Saving processor state*. If the interrupt routines needs to modify the processor state, e.g. register values
        $\to$ It must explicitly save the current state and then restore the state before returning
        * *Purpose*. After the interrupt is serviced, the saved return address is loaded into the program counter

            $\to$ The interrupted computation resumes as if the interrupt had not occurred

### Storage structure
#### Memory
**Storing instructions**. The CPU can load instructions only from memory

$\to$ Any programs to run must be stored there
* *General purpose computers*. Run most of their programs from rewritable memory, called *main memory*, or RAM

**Forms of memory of a computer**.
* *Main memory*. Commonly implemented in a semiconductor technology, called dynamic random-access memory (DRAM)
* *Read-only memory (ROM)*. Memory which cannot be changed

    $\to$ To store only static programs
* *EEPROM*. Memory which cannot be changed frequently

    $\to$ To store mostly static programs, e.g. factory-installed programs

**Memory structure**. An array of words, each of which has its own address
* *Interaction between words*. Achieved through a sequence of `load` and `store` instructions to specific memory addresses
    * *`load` instruction*. Move a word from main memory to an internal register within the CPU
    * *`store` instruction*. Move the content of an register to main memory

    >**NOTE**. Aside from `load` and `store`, the CPU automatically loads instructions from main memory for execution

#### Secondary storage
**Instruction-execution cycle in von Neumann architecture**.
1. Fetch an instruction from memory and stores the instruction in the *instruction register* (IR)
2. The instruction is decoded, which may cause operands to be fetched from memory and stored in some internal register
3. The instruction on the operands is executed, and the result is stored back in memory

>**NOTE**. The memory unit sees only a stream of memory addresses, without knowing how they are generated, or what they are for
>$\to$ We can ignore how a memory address is generated by a program, and focus only on the sequence of memory addresses generated by the running program

**Secondary storage**. An extension of main memory
* *Motivation*. Ideally, we want the programs and data to reside in main memory forever. But this is not possible, i.e.
    * Main memory is usually too small to store all needed programs and data forever
    * Main memory is a volatile storage, which loses its contents when power is turned off or otherwise lost
* *Main requirement*. The secondary storage is able to hold large quantities of data permanently
* *The most common secondary-storage device*. A magnetic disk, which provides storage for both programs and data
    * *Functionality*.
        * Most programs, i.e. system and applciation, are stored on a disk until they are loaded into memory
        * Many programs use the disk as both the source and the destination of their processing
    * *Design objective*. Focus on proper management of disk storage

#### Storage system
**Storage system**. Basically include registers, main memory, and magnetic disks
* *Optional components*. Cache memory, CD-ROM, magnetic tapes, etc.
* *Functionality*. Provide the basic functions of storing a datum, and holding that datum until it is retrieved at a later time

**Classifying storage systems**. 

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/media/IhteUrd.png">
    <figcaption>Storage-device hierarchy</figcaption>
</div>

* *By cost and speed*. The wide variety of storage systems in a computer system can be organized in a hierarchy, according to speed and cost

    * *Explain the figure*. The higher levels are expessive, but they are fast

* *Volatile and nonvolatile*. Volatile storage ;oses its contents when the power to the device is removed

    $\to$ In the absense of expensive battery and generator backup systems, data must be written to nonvolatile storage for safekeeping
    * *Explain the figure*. The storage systems above the electronic disk are volatile

**Design of a complete memory system**. Must balance all the factors below
* It must use only as much expensive memory as necessary
* It must provide as much inexpensive, nonvolatile memory as possible

### I/O structure

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/media/w2J8CP6.png">
    <figcaption>How a modern computer system works</figcaption>
</div>

>**NOTE**. Storage is only one of many types of I/O devices within a computer

**Device controller in general-purpose computer system**. 
* *Number of attached devices*. Depending on the controller, more than one device may be attached
* *Roles*. 
    * Maintain some local buffer storage and a set of special-purpose registers
    * Move the data between the peripheral devices, which it controls, to its local buffer storage
* *Device driver*. Specialized for each device controller, to understand the device controller and present a uniform interface (to the device) to the rest of the OS

**Starting a I/O operation**.
* *Normal routine*. Fine for moving small amounts of data but can produce high overhead when used for bulk data movement, e.g. disk I/O
    1. The device driver loads the appropriate registers within the device controller
    2. The device controller examines the contents of its registers to determine what action to take
    3. The controller starts the transfer of data, from the device to its local buffer
    4. The device controller informs the device driver via an interrupt that it has finished its operation
    5. The device driver returns control to the OS, 
        * Possibly returning data or a pointer to the data if the opartion was a read
        * Otherwise, the status information is returned
* *Directed memory access (DMA)*. Used for bulkd data movement with I/O devices, with the routine described below
    1. Set the buffers, pointers, and counters for the I/O device
    2. The device conrtoller transfers an entire block of data directly to, or from its own buffer storage, to memory, without intervention by the CPU

        $\to$ Only one interrupt is generated per block, to tell the device driver that the operation has completed, rather than one interrupt per byte
    3. While the device controller is performing these operations, the CPU is available to do other works

>**NOTE**. Some high-end systems use switch rather than bus architecture, so that multiple components can talk to other components concurrently, rather than competing for cycles on a shared bus
>$\to$ In this case, DMA is even more effective

## Computer system architecture
### Single-processor systems
**Single-processor system**. Most systems, ranging from PDAs through mainframes, use a single processors
* *Description*. There is one main CPU capable of executing a general-purpose instruction set, including instructions from user processes
* *Special-purpose processors*. Almost all systems have other special-purpose processors as well, e.g. disk, keyboard, etc.
    * *Instruction set*. All special-purpose processors run a limited instruction set and do not run user processes
    * *Management*. 
        * Sometimes, special-purpose processors are managed by the OS, i.e. the OS sends them information about their next task and monitors their status
            
            $\to$ This releases the main CPU of the overhead of specialized tasks
        * In other systems, special-purpose processors are low-level components built into the hardware

            $\to$ The OS cannot communicate with these processors. In fact, these processors do their jobs autonomously
    
    >**NOTE**. The use of special-purpose processors is common and does not turn a single-processor system into a multiprocessor
    >* *Explain*. If there is only one general-purpose CPU, then the system is a single-processor system

### Multiprocessor systems
**Multiprocessor systems**. Also called *parallel systems* or *tightly coupled systems*
* *Description*. There are two or more processors in close communication, sharing the computer bus and sometimes the clock, memory, and peripheral devices
* *Advantages*.
    * *Increased throughput*. By increasing the number of processors, we expect to get more work done in less time
        * *Speed-up ratio*. The speed-up ratio with $N$ processors is not $N$, but it is less than $N$
            * *Explain*. When multiple processors cooperate on a task, a certain amount of overhead is incurred in keeping all the parts working correctly

                $\to$ This lowers the expected gain from additional processors
    * *Economy of scale*. Multiprocessor systems can cost less than equivalent multiple single-processor systems, since they can share peripherals, mass storage, and power supplies
    * *Increased reliability*. If functions can be distributed properly among several processors, then the failure of one processor will not halt the system, only slow it down
        * *Explain*. If one processor fails, each of the remaining processors can pick up a share of the work of the failed processor

        >**NOTE**. Increased reliability of a computer system is crucial in many applications

**Types of multiprocessor systems**. Different types of multiprocessor systems can be implemented via hardware or software
* *Asymmetric multiprocessing*. Each processor is assigned a specific task, using master-slave relationship
    * *Master-slave relationship*. The master processor schedules and allocates work to the slave processors, i.e.
        * A master processor controls the system
        * Other processors look to the master for instruction, or have predefined tasks
* *Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP)*. Each processor performs all tasks within the OS

    <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="/media/G95ITPE.png">
        <figcaption>Symmetric multiprocessing architecture</figcaption>
    </div>

    >**NOTE**. This is used by the most common systems
    
    * *Peer relationship*. All processors are peers
        * Each processor has its own set of registers, and a private (or local) cache
        * All processors share physical memory
    * *Pros and cons*.
        * *Pros*. Many processes can run simultaneously, without causing a significant deterioration of performance
        * *Cons*. 
            * I/O must be carefully controlled to ensure that the data reach the appropriate processor
            * Since the CPUs are separate, one may sitting idle while another is overloaded

**Multiprocessing implies increase in addressable memory**. Multiprocessing adds CPUs to increase computing power

$\to$ If each CPU has an integrated memory controller, then the amount of addressable memory in the system will increase
* *Memory access model*. Multiprocessing can cause a system to change its memory-access model, from uniform memory access model (UMA) to non-uniform memory access model (NUMA)
    * *UMA*. The situation, in which access to any RAM from any CPU takes the same amount of time
    * *NUMA*. Some parts of memory may take longer to access than other parts, creating a performance penalty
* *Minimizing the NUMA penalty*. OSes can minimize the NUMA penalty through resource management

**A recent trend in CPU design**.
* *Multicore CPUs*. Have multiple computing cores on a single chip

    <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="/media/InEikl2.png">
        <figcaption>A dual-core design with two cores placed on the same chip</figcaption>
    </div>

    * *Pros*.
        * More efficient than multiple chips with single core
            * *Explain*. On-chip communication is faster than between-chip communication
        * One chip with multiple cores uses significantly less power than multiple single-core chips
    * *Usage*. Well suited for server systems due to less power consumption
    * *Design*.
        * *Basic design*. Each core has its own register set and local cache
        * *Other design*. Use a shared cache, or a combination of local and shared caches
    * *Interface to the OS*. Multicore CPUs appear to the OS as $N$ standard processors

        $\to$ OS designers and application programmers must make use of these CPUs
* *Blade server*. Multiple processor boards, I/O boards, and networking boards are placed in the same chassis
    * *Difference from traditional multiprocessor systems*. Each blade-processor board boots independently and runs its own OS
    * *Variants*. Some blade-server boards are multiprocessor

### Clustered systems

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/media/Tx9KyoR.png">
    <figcaption>General structure of a clustered system</figcaption>
</div>

**Clustered system**. Gather together multiple CPUs to accomplish computational work
* *Difference from multiprocessor systems*. Clustered systems are composed of two or more individual systems, or nodes, joined together
* *Accepted definition of clustered system*. Clustered computers share storage and are closely linked via a local-area network (LAN), or a faster interconnect, e.g. InfiniBand
* *Usage*. 
    * Provide high-availability service
        * *Explain*. Service will continue even if one or more systems in the cluster fail

            >**NOTE**. High-availability is generally obtained by adding a level of redundancy in the system
    * Provide high-performance computing environments
        * *Explain*. There are several computer systems connected via a network

            >**NOTE**. Applications must be written specifically to take advantage of the cluster by using parallelization

**Nodes**. A layer of cluster software runs on the cluster nodes
* Each node monitor one or more of the others (over the LAN)

    $\to$ If the monitored machine fails, the monitoring machine can take ownership of its storage and restart the running applications

**Clustering structure**.
* *Asymmetric clustering*. One machine is hot-standby mode, while the other is running the applications
    * The hot-standby host machine monitors the active server

        $\to$ If the server fails, the hot-standby host becomes the active server
* *Symmetric clustering*. Two or more hosts are running applications and are monitoring each other

    >**NOTE**. This mode is more efficient, since it uses all of the available hardware

**Variations**. Parallel clusterse and clustering over a wide-area network (WAN)
* *Parallel clusters*. Allow multiple hosts to access the same data on the shared storage
    * *Implementation*. Use special versions of software and special releases of aplications
        * *Explain*. Most OSes lack support for simultaneous data access by multiple hosts
        * *Example*. Oracle's database is designed to run on a parallel cluster
        
        >**NOTE**. To provide the shared access to data, the system must supply access control and locking to ensure that no conflicting operations occur
* *Storage-area networks (SANs)*. Allow many systems to attach to a pool of storage

    $\to$ If the applications and their data are stored on the SAN, then the cluster software can assign the application to run on any host attached to the SAN

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Resource utilization**. How various hardware and software resources are shared

**Control program**. Manage the execution of user programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer

**Storage definitions and notation**.
* *Bit*. A bit, which can contain one of two values, i.e. 0 and 1, is the basic unit of computer storage
    * *Usage*. ALl other storage in a computer is based on collections of bits
* *Byte*. 1 byte = 8 bits. This is the smallest convenient chunk of storage in most computers
* *Word*. A given computer architecture's native storage unit
    * *Structure*. A word is generally made up of one or more bytes
* *Other storage units*.
    * *Kilobyte* (KB). $1024$ bytes
    * *Megabyte* (MB). $1024^2$ bytes
    * *Gigabyte* (GB). $1024^3$  bytes

    >**NOTE**. Computer manufacturers often round off these numbers and say that $1$ MB = $1,000,000$ bytes
    
**Firmware**. Read-only memory (ROM), or electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM)

**Routine**. A function, procedure, and subprogram, is code that may be called and executed anywhere in a program

**RAM**. Random-access memory
* *DRAM*. Dynamic random-access memory

**Volatility of electronic disk**. An electronic disk can be designed to be volatile or nonvolatile
* *Normal operation*. The electronic disk stores data in a large DRAM array, which is volatile
* *Crashed operation*. Many electronic-disk devices contain a hidden magnetic hard disk, and a battery for backup power
    * If external power is interrupted
        
        $\to$ The electronic-disk controller copies the data from RAM to the magnetic disk
    * When the external power is restored

        $\to$ The controller copies the data back into RAM

**Some forms of electronic disk**.
* *Flash memory*. Another form of electronic disk, which is popular in cameras and personal digital assistants (PDAs)
    * *Characteristics*. Slower than DRAM but need no power to retain its contents
* *NVRAM*. DRAM with battery backup power
    * *Characteristics*. As fast as DRAM and is nonvolatile, as long as the battery lasts

**Cache**. Can be installed to improve performance where a large access-time or transfer-rate disparity exists between two components

**Graceful degradation**. The ability to continue providing service proportional to the level of surviving hardware
* *Fault tolerant*. The next level of graceful degradation, i.e. the system can suffer a failure of any single component and still continue operation
    * *Requirements*. A mechanism, which automatically detect, diagnose, and correct (if possible) the failure
    * *Example*. Hardware and software duplication (used in HP NonStop)

**Paralellization**. Divide a program into separate components running in parallel on individual computers in the cluster
* *Typical design*. Once each computing node in the cluster has solved its portion of the problem

    $\to$ The results from all the nodes are combined into a final solution

**Distributed lock management (DLM)**. Introduce locking to ensure that no conflicting operations occu
