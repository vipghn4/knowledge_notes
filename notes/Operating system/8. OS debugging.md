# 8. OS debugging
## Failure analysis
**Process failure**. If a process fails, most OSes write the error information to a log file to alert system operators or users that the problem occurred
* *Core dump*. The OS can also take a core dump
    * *Core dump*. A capture of the memory, i.e. referred to as the *core* in the early days of computing, of the process
    * *Usage*. Stored in a file for later analysis
* *Debugger*. A tool designed to allow a programmer to explore the code and memory of a process
    * *Usage*. Probe running programs and core dumps

**Kernel failure**. OS kernel debugging is more complex due to the size and complexity of the kernel, its control of the hardware, and the lack of user-level debugging tools
* *Crash*. A kernel failure
* *Crash dump*. Error information of a crash is saved to a log file, and the memory state is saved to a crash dump

## Performance tuning
**Monitoring system performance**. A method for identifying bottlenecks
* *Idea*.
    * Add code to compute and display measures of system behavior

        >**NOTE**. In some systems, the OS does this task by producing trace listings of system behavior
        >$\to$ All interesting events are logged with their time and important parameters, and are written to a file

    * An analysis program can process the log file to determine system performance and to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies

        >**NOTE**. These traces can be run as input for a simulation of a suggested improved system, or help people to find errors in OS behavior

**Interactive tools**. Interactive tools can be included with the system to allow users and administrators to question the state of various components of the system to look for bottle necks
* *Example*. UNIX's command `top` displays the resources used on the system

**Inspecting running OSes**. Making running OSes easier to understand, debug, and tune is an active area of OS research and implementation

## System boot
**Problem**. How the hardware know where the kernel is, or how to load that kernel

### Booting
**Booting a system**. The procedure of starting a computer by loading the kernel

**Boostrap program**. Also called boostrap loader. A small piece of code to locate the kernel, load it into main memory, and start its execution
* *Two-step boostrap loader*. A simple bootstrap loader fetches a more complex boot program from disk, which in turn loads the kernel

### Restarting (rebooting)
**Procedure of rebooting**. The instruction register is loaded with a predefined memory location, and execution starts there

$\to$ That location contains the inital boostrap program

>**NOTE**. Bootstrap program is in the form of ROM, since the RAM is in an unknown state at system startup
>* *Why ROM*. Convenient since it needs no initialization and cannot easily be infected by a computer virus

**Other tasks related to bootstrap program**.
* Diagnose to determine the state of the machine
* Initialize all aspects of the system, from CPU registers to device controllers and the contents of main memory

### Storing OSes
**Small systems**. Store the OS in ROM
* *Explain*. These systems have simple supporting hardware, and rugged operation

**Large system**. The bootstrap loader is stored in firmware, and the OS is on disk
* *Explain*. These systems change frequently, or have large size

>**NOTE**. When the full bootstreap program has been loaded, it can traverse the file system to find the OS kernel, load it into memory, and start its execution
>$\to$ It is only at this point that the system is said to be *running*

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Kernel-enabled performance analysis**. Tools which are breaking the cycle of enabling tracing as system problems occur and analyzing the traces later
* *Pros*. These tools are not single-purpose or merely for sections of code, which were written to emit debugging data

## Discussions
**Kernighan's law**. Debugging is twice as hard as writing code in the first place

$\to$ If we write the code as clevery as possible, we are, by definition, not smart enough to debug i
