# 5. OS services
## OS services
**OS services**. OS provides certain services to programs and to the users of those programs

>**NOTE**. The specific services provided differ from one OS to another, but we can identify common classes

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/media/06fbVde.png">
    <figcatpion>A view of OS services</figcatpion>
</div>

* *Purpose*.
    * The convenience of the programmer
    * Make the programming task easier

**Services for users**. Provide functions which are helpful to the user
* *User interface*. Almost all OSes have a UI
    * *UI form*. An OS may provide one or more forms of UI
        * *Command-line interface (CLI)*. Use text commands and a method for entering them
        * *Batch interface*. Commands and directives to control the commands are entered into files

            $\to$ Those files will be executed
        * *Graphical user interface (GUI)*. A window system with a pointing device to direct I/O, choose menus, etc.
* *Program execution*.
    * The system must be able to load a program into memory and run the program
    * The program must be able to end its execution, either normally or abnormally
* *I/O operations*. A running program may require I/O, i.e. files or an I/O device

    >**NOTE**. For specific devices, special functions may be desired

    >**NOTE**. For efficiency and protection, users usually cannot control I/O devices directly
    >$\to$ The OS must provide means to do I/O

* *File-system manipulation*. Many OSes provide a variety of file systems
    * *Purpose*. To allow personal choice, and sometimes to provide specific features or performance characteristics
    * *Motivation*.
        * Programs need to read and write files and directories
        * Programs need to create and delete files by name, search for given name, and list file information
        * Some programs include permissions management to allow or deny access to files or directories based on file ownership
* *Communications*. One process may need to exchange information with another process
    * *Implementation*. Communication may be implemented via *shared memory* or through *message passing*
* *Error detection*. The OS needs to be constantly aware of possible errors
    * *Sources of error*.
        * CPU and memory hardware
        * I/O devices
        * User program

**Services for system efficient operation**. Systems with multiple users can gain efficiency by sharing the computer resources among the users
* *Resource allocation*
* *Accounting*. We want to keep track of which users use how much and what kinds of computer resources
    * *Purpose*. Accounting, i.e. so that users can be billed, or research purpose
* *Protection and security*. The owners of information stored in a multiuser or networked computer system may want to control use of the information
    * *Protection*. Ensure that all access to the system resources is controlled
    * *Security*. Secure the system from external attacks

## User OS interface
**Fundamental UIs**. CLI and GUI

### Command interpreter
**Command interpreter in OSes**.
* Some OSes include the command interpreter in the kernel
* Others treat the command interpreter as a special program, which is running
    * When a job is initiated, or
    * When a user first logs on (on interactive systems)

**Shells**. Command interpreters on systems with multiple command interpreters to choose from
* *Example*. Bourne shell, C shell, etc. (Linux)

    >**NOTE**. Third-party shells and free user-written shells are also available

**Main function of command interpreter**. Get and execute the next user-specified command
* *Command implementation*.
    * *Approach 1*. The command interpreters contains the code the execute the command

        $\to$ The number of commands, which can be given, determines the size of the command interpreter
    * *Approach 2*. Most commands are implemeted through system programs

        $\to$ The command interpreter does not understand the command, it merely uses the command to identify a file to be loaded into memory and executed

        >**NOTE**. This is used by UNIX, among other OSes

        * *Example*. The UNIX command to delete a file `rm` would
            1. Search for a file called `rm`
            2. Execute the file with the parameter `file.txt`
        * *Pros*. Programmers can add new commands to the system easily by creating new files with the proper names

### Graphical user interfaces
**Interacting with the OS via GUI**. Users employ a mouse-based window-and-meny system characterized by a *desktop* metaphor
* The user moves mouse to position its pointer on images, or *icons*, on the screen, i.e. the desktop, which represent programs, files, directories, and system functions
* Clicking a button on the mouse can
    * Invoke a program
    * Select a file or directory, i.e. a folder
    * Pull down a menu containing commands

## System calls
**System calls**. Provide an interface to the services made available by an OS
* *System call format*. Routines written in C and C++

    >**NOTE**. Certain low-level tasks may need to be written using assembly-language instructions

>**NOTE**. Most programmers never see the level of detail, where the system calls are executed

**Application program interface (API)**. Typically, application developers design programs according to an API
* *API*. Specify a set of functions available to an application programmer, including the I/O of these functions
    * *Examples*. Win32 API (Windows), POSIX API (UNIX, Linux, Mac OS X), Java API, etc.
    * *API's functions*. The functions making up an API typically invoke the actual system calls on behalf of the application programmer
* *Why working with API rather than working with system calls directly*.
    * Programming according to an API concerns program portability
        * *Explain*. The program can run anywhere supporting the API
    * Actual system calls can often be more detailed and difficult to work with than the API available to an application programmer

**System-call interface**. The runtime support system for most programming languages provides a system-call interface, which serves as the link to system calls made available by the OS

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/media/ldAkQAW.png">
    <figcaption>Handling a user application invoking the `open()` system call</figcaption>
</div>

* *Purpose*. Intercept function calls in the API and invokes the necessary system calls within the OS
* *System call identifiers*. Typically, a number is associated with each system call

    $\to$ The SCI maintains a table indexed according to these numbers
* *Mechanism*.
    1. The SCI invokes the intended system call in the OS kernel
    2. The SCI returns the status of the system call and any return values

**Passing parameters to the OS**.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/media/MfkNRSk.png">
    <figcaption>Passing of parameters as a table</figcaption>
</div>

* *Approach 1*. Pass the parameters in *registers* (simplest)
* *Approach 2*. Store parameters in a  block, or table, in memory

    $\to$ The address of the block is passed as a parameter in a register
    * *Usage*. When there are more parameters than registers

    >**NOTE**. This approach is used by Linux

* *Approach 3*. Place, or push, parameters onto the stack by the program and the OS pops the stack

## Types of system calls
There are six categories of system calls listed below
* Process control
* File manipulation
* Device manipulation
* Information maintenance
* Communications
* Protection

### Process control
**Motivation**. A running program needs to be able to halt its execution normally, i.e. `end`, or abnormally, i.e. `abort`

#### Basic components
**Debugger**. A system program designed to aid the programmer in finding and correcting bugs
* *Mechanism*.
    1. If a system call is made to terminate the currently running program abnormally, or if the program runs into a problem and causes an error trap

        $\to$ A dump of memory is sometimes taken and an error message generated
    2. The dump is written to disk and may be examined by a debugger to determine the cause of the problem

* Under normal or abnormal circumstances, the OS must transfer control to the invoking command interpreter
* The command interpreter then reads the next command
    * In an interactive system, the command interpreter simply continues with the next command
        >**NOTE**. It is assumed that The user will issue an appropriate command to respond to any error

    * In a GUI system, a pop-up window might alert the user to the error and ask for guidance
    * In a batch system, the command interpreter usually terminates the entire job and continues with the next job

**Control card**. A batch-system concept, i.e. a command to manage the execution of a process
* *Usage*. Allowed by some systems to indicate special recovery actions in case an error occurs
* *Error level*. If the program discovers an error in its input and wants to terminate abnormally

    $\to$ It may also want to define an error level, i.e. more severe errors can be indicated by a higher-level error parameters
    * *Consequences*.
        * We can combine normal and abnormal termination by defining a normal termination as an error at level 0
        * The command interpreter or a following program can use this error level to determine the next action automatically

**Nested processes**. A process or a job executing one program may want to load and execute another program
* *Pros*. The command interpreter can execute a program as directed by a user command or a batch command
* *Problems*. Where to return control when the loaded program terminates

    $\to$ Whether the existing program is lost, saved, or allowed to continue execution concurrently with the new program

#### System calls
**System calls related to processes**.
* *`create process` or `submit job`*
    * If control returns to the existing program when the new program terminates, we must save the memory image of the existing program

        $\to$ We have effectively created a mechanism for one program to call another
    * If both programs continue concurrently

        $\to$ We have created a new job or process to be multiprogrammed
* *`get process attributes` and `set process attributes`*. If we create a set of new jobs or processes, we should be able to control its execution

    $\to$ We must be able to determine and reset the attributes of a job or a process
* *`terminate process`*. If we find a process is incorrect or is no longer needed

    $\to$ We must be able to terminate it
* *`wait time`*. Having created new processes, we may need to wait for them to finish their execution
    * *`wait event`*. We may want to wait for a certain amount of time to pass
    * *`wait event`*. We may want to wait for a specific event to occur

        $\to$ The processes should signal when the event has occurred, i.e. `signal event`
* *`acquire lock` and `release lock`*. Sometimes, processes may share data

    $\to$ OS often provide system calls allowing a process to lock shared data, preventing another process from accessing the data while it is locked

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/media/hZU1kLR.png">
    <figcaption>Standard C library handling of write()</figcaption>
</div>

### File management
**Prequisite functionalities for file and directory systems**.
* Be able to create and delete files
* Be able to read, write, or reposition, i.e. rewinding or skipping to the end of the file
* Be able to close the file, i.e. indicating that we are no longer using it
* Be able to determine the values of various attributes, and maybe to reset them if needed

**Optional functionalities**. Move and copy files

### Device management
**Problem**. A program may need several resources to execute, e.g. main memory, disk drives, access to files, etc.

$\to$ If the resources are not available, the process will have to wait until sufficient resources are available

**Types of devices**.
* *Physical devices*. Disk, drives, etc.
* *Abstract or virtual devices*. Files, etc.

**Resource allocation in multiple-user systems**. Similar to openning and closing files
* User has to request the device, to ensure exclusive use of it
* User can read, write, and possibly reposition the device
* After finishing with the device, user has to release it

**File-device similarity**. The similarity between I/O devices and files is so great that many OS, including UNIX, merge the two into a combined file-device structure

$\to$ In this case, a set of system calls is used on both files and devices

>**NOTE**. Sometimes, I/O devices are identified by special file names, directory placement, or file attributes

### Information maintenance
**Information-maintenance-related system calls**.
* Many system calls exist simply for the purpose of transferring information between the user program and the OS
* Another set of system calls is helpful in debugging a program
* Many OSes provide a time profile of a program to indicate the amount of time, which the program executes at a particular location or set of locations

### Communication
There are two common models of interprocess communication, i.e. the message-passing model and the shared-memory model

**Message-passing model**. The communicating process exchange messages with one another to transfer information
* *Prequisites for communication*.
    * A connection must be opened
    * The name of the other communicator must be known, i.e.
        * Each computer has a network identifier, e.g. an IP address
        * Each process has a process name
* *Exchanging messages*. Directly or indirectly through a common mailbox, i.e.
    1. The identifiers are passed to the general-purpose `open connection` and `close connection` system calls, depending on the system's model of communication

        >**NOTE**. The recipient process usually must give its permission for communication to take place with an `accept connection` call

    2. The source of communication, i.e. the client, and the receiving daemon, i.e. a server, then exchanges messages using `read message` and `write message` system calls
    3. The `close connecton` call terminates the communication
* *Applications*. Useful for exchanging smaller amounts of data, i.e. since
    * No conflicts need to be avoided
    * Easier to implement

**Shared-memory model**. Processes use `shared memory create` and `shared memory attach` system calls to create and gain access to regions of memory owned by other processes

$\to$ They can exchange information by reading and writing data in the shared areas

>**NOTE**. Normally, the OS tries to prevent one process from accessing another process' memory
>$\to$ Shared memory requires that the two processes agree to remove this restriction

>**NOTE**. The processes are responsible for ensuring that they are not writing to the same location simultaneously

* *Data format*. Determined by the processes without care of OS' control
* *Applications*. Allow maximum speed and convenience of communication, i.e. since
    * It can be done at memory transfer speeds when it takes place within a computer

## System programs
**Aplication programs**. Useful in solving common problems or performing common operations

**System programs**. Also called system utilities. Provide a convenient environment for program development and execution

**Types of system calls**.
* *File management*. Create, delete, copy, rename, print, dump, list, and generally manipulate files and directories
* *Status information*. Ask the system for
    * *Simple information*. The date, time, amount of available memory or disk space, number of users, or similar status information
    * *Complex information*. Performance, logging, and debugging information

    >**NOTE**. Some systems also support a registry, which is used to store and retrieve configuration information

* *File modification*. Create and modify the content of files stored on disk or other storage devices
* *Programming-language support*. Compilers, assemblers, debuggers, and interpreters for common programming language
* *Program loading and execution*. Load programs into memory for execution, once they are assembled or compiled
    * *Types of loaders*. Absolute loaders, relocatable loaders, linkage editors, and overlay loaders

    >**NOTE**. Debugging systems for higher-level languages or machine language are required as well

* *Communication*. Provide mechanism for createing virtual connections among processes, users, and computer systems

# Appendix
## Case study
**MS-DOS OS**. An example of a single-tasking system, i.e. use a simple method to run a program without creating a new one
* *Command interpreter*. Invoked when the computer is started
* *Program execution procedure*.

    <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="/media/E8CYEk7.png">
        <figcaption>MS-DOS execution. (a) At system startup. (b) Running a program</figcaption>
    </div>

    * *Start*.
        * Load the program into memory, writing over the OS to give the program as much memory as possible
        * Set the instruction pointer to the first instruction of the program
    * *Running*. The program then run, and either an error causes a trap, or the program executes a system call to terminate

        >**NOTE**. In either case, the error code is saved in the system memory for later use

    * *After running*. The small portion of the command interpreter, which was not overwritten resumes execution, i.e.
        1. The rest of the command interpreter is loaded from disk
        2. The command interpreter makes the previous error code available to the user, or to the next program

**FreeBSD**. An example of a multi-tasking system
* *Shell*. When a user logs on to the system, the shell of the user's choice is run
    * *Functionality*. Accept commands and execute programs requested by user

        >**NOTE**. The interpreter may continue running while another program is executed

* *Program execution procedure*.

    <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="/media/4XUECps.png">
        <figcaption>FreeBSD runnig multiple programs</figcaption>
    </div>

    * *Start*.
        * The shell executes a `fork()` system call to start a new process
        * The selected program is loaded into memory via an `exec()` system call
        * The program is executed
    * *Running*. Depending on the way the command was issued, the shell will wait for the process to finish or run the process in the background

        >**NOTE**. In the latter case, the shell immediately requests another command

        >**NOTE**. A process running in the background cannot receive input directly from the keyboard, since the shell is using this resource
            >$\to$ I/O is done through files or through a GUI interface

    * *End*. When the process is done, it executes an `exit()` system call to terminate, returning to the invoking process a status code of 0 or a nonzero error code

        $\to$ This status or error code is then available to the shell or other programs

**Device management in UNIX**.
* *Device representation*. All devices are represented by special files located in `/dev` directory

    >**NOTE**. Network devices are exceptions on modern OS

    * *Regular file*. An ordinary data file in the disk
    * *Block special file*. Represent a device with characteristics similar to a disk, i.e. data transfer in terms of blocks
    * *Character special file*. Represent a device with characteristics similar to a keyboard, i.e. data transfer is by stream of bits in sequential order
* *Device files and device numbers*.
    * *Device number*. The files in `/dev` each has an associated major and minor device number

        $\to$ The kernel uses these numbers to map the device file references to the corresponding drivers

        * *Major device number*. Identify the driver, i.e. the device type, with which the file is associated
        * *Minor drive number*. Identify the particular instance of a given device type to be addressed

## Concepts
**Message passing**. Packets of information are moved between processes by the OS

**Runtime support system**. A set of functions built into libraries included with a compiler

**Daemon**. System programs provided for the purpose of receiving connections, i.e. they execute a `wait for connection` call, and are awakened when a connection is made

**Microkernel-based OSes**. Take the separation of mechanism and policy to one extreme by implementing a basic set of primitive building blocks

$\to$ The blocks are almost policy free, allowing more advanced mechanisms and policies to be added via user-created kernel modules or via user programs themselves

**Emulators**. Programs to duplicate the functionality of one system with another syste
