# 4. Systems and computing environments
## Distributed systems
**Distributed system**. A collection of physically separate, possibly heterogeneous, computer systems, which are networked to provide the users with access to the various resources which the system maintains
* *Purposes*. Inrease computation speed, functionality, data availablity, and reliability
* *Networking*.
    * Some OSes generalize network access as a form of file access, with the details of networking contained in the network interface's device driver
    * Others make users specifically invoke network functions

**Network**. A communication path between two or more systems

>**NOTE**. Distributed systems depend on networking for their functionality

* *Types of network*. Vary in protocols used, the distances between nodes, and the transport media
    * *Common protocols*. TCP/IP (most common), ATM (widespread use), etc.
        * *OS support of protocols*. Most OSes support TCP/IP, including Windows and UNIX OSes
        * *Components of a network protocol*. To an OS, a network protocol needs
            * An interface device, e.g. a network adapter
            * A device driver to manage the interface device
            * Software to handle data
    * *Distances between nodes*.
        * *Local-area network (LAN)*. Connect computers within a room, a floor, or a building
        * *Wide-area network (WAN)*. Link buidlings, cities, or countries

        >**NOTE**. LAN or WAN may run one protocol or several protocols

        * *Other networks*. Metropolitan-area network (MAN), i.e. link buildings within a city, small-area network (SAN), i.e. communicate over a distance of several feet
* *Network carrier media*. Copper wires, fiber strands, and wireless transmission between satellites, microwave dishes, and radios

**Network OS**. Some OSes have taken the concept of networks and distributed systems further than merely providing network connectivity
* *Network OS*. An OS providing features, e.g. file sharing and a communication scheme allowing different processes on different computers to exchange messages

>**NOTE**. A compute running a network OS acts autonomously from all other computers on the network

**Distributed OS**. Provide a less autonomous environment
* *Explain*. The different OSes communicate closely enough to provide the illusion, which only a single OS controls the network

## Special-purpose systems
### Real-time embedded systems
**Embedded computers**. The most prevalent form of computers in existence
* *Characteristics*.
    * The systems they run on are usually primitive

        $\to$ The OSes provide limited features
    * The system has little or no user interface, preferring to spend their time monitoring and managing hardware devices
* *Types of embedded systems*.
    * Some are general-purpose computers, running standard OSes, e.g. UNIX, with special-purpose applications to implement the functionality
    * Others are hardware devices with a special-purpose embedded OS providing just the functionality desired
    * Others are hardware devices with application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which perform their tasks without an OS
* *Operating system*. Embedded systems almost always run real-time OSes

### Multimedia systems
**Multimedia systems**. Most OSes are designed to handle conventional data. However, a recent trend in technology is the incorporation of multimedia data into computer systems

## Computing environments
### Client-server computing
**Typical office environment**. Centralized system architecture is preferred
* PCs are connected to a network, with servers providing files and print services
* Remote access was awkward, and portability was achieved by the use of laptop computers
* Terminals attached to mainframes were common at many companies, with even fewer remote access

**Current trend**. Provide more ways to access these computing environments, as web technologies are stretching the boundaries of traditional computing
* *Portals*. Companies established portals, which provide Web accessibility to their internal servers
* *Network computers*. Eseentially terminals which understand Web-based computing
* *Handheld computers*. Can synchronize with PCs to allow very portable use of company information
* *Wireless networks*. Handheld PDAs can also connect to wireless networks to use company's Web portal, as well as the other Web resources

**Typical household environment**. Most users had a single computer with a slow modem connection to the office, the Internet, or both
* *Firewalls*. Some home even have firewalls, which cost thousands of USD a few years ago and did not even exist a decade ago, to protect their networks from security breaches

**Time sharing system**.
* *Batch and interactive systems*. For a period of time, when computing resources were scarce, systems were either batch or interactive
    * *Batch system*. Process jobs in bulk, with predetermined input, i.e. from files or other sources of data
    * *Interactive system*. Wait for input from users
* *Time-sharing systems*. Use a timer and scheduling algorithms to cycle processes rapidly through the CPU, giving each user a share of resources

    >**NOTE**. Today, the same scheduling technique is still in use on workstations and servers, but frequently the processes are all owned by the same user, or a single user and the OS

### Client-server computing
**Trending**. As PCs have become faster, more powerful, and cheaper, designers have shifted away from centralized system architecture
* *Several trends*.
    * Terminals connected to centralized systems are now being alternated by PCs
    * UI functionality once handled directly by centralized systems is increasingly being handled by PCs
* *Client-server system*. A form of specialized distributed system. Today's systems act as server systems to satisfy requests generated by client systems

**Types of servers**.
* *Compute servers*. Provide an interface, to which a client can send a request to perform an action, e.g. read data

    $\to$ In response, the server executes the action and sends back results to the client
    * *Example*. A server running a database which responds to client requests for data
* *File servers*. Provide a file-system interface where clients can create, update, read, and delete files
    * *Example*. A Web server which delivers filesto clients running Web browsers

### Peer-to-peer computing
**P2P system model**. Clients and servers are not distinguished from one another

$\to$ All nodes within the system are considered peers, and each may act as either a client or a server, depending on whether it is requesting ot providing a service
* *Pros over client-server systems*. In a client-server system, the server is a bottleneck, but in a P2P system, services can be provided by several nodes distributed throughout the network

**Participating in a P2P system**.
1. A node must join the network of peers
2. The node then can begin providing services to, and requesting services, from, other nodes in the network

**Determining types of services available**.
* *Option 1*. When a node joins a network, it registers its service with a centralized lookup service on the network
    * *Service requests*.
        1. Any node desiring a specific service first contacts this centralized lookup service to determine which node provides the service
        2. The remainder of the communication takes place between the client and the service provider
* *Option 2*. A peer acting as a client must first discover what node provides a desired service by broadcasting a request for the service to all other nodes in  the network

    $\to$ The node, or nodes, providing the service responds to the peer making the request
    * *Discovery protocol*. Must be provided, i.e. to allow peers to discover services provided by other peers in the network, to support this option

**Popularity**. P2P networks gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s with several file-sharing services enabling peers to exchange files with one another

### Web-based computing
**Consequences of Web-based computing**. Give rise to new categories of devices, e.g. load balancer, which distribute network connection among a pool of similar servers

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Multimedia data**. Consist of audio and video files, as well as conventional files

>**NOTE**. Multimedia data must be delivered, i.s. streamed, according to certain time restrictions

**Mainframes and terminals**.
* *Mainframes*. Computers in which all the processing is done centrally
* *Dump terminals*. The users of the mainframes, which only input and output, without doing processin
