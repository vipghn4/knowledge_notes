# Types of distributed systems
## High performance distributed computing
**High performance distributed computing**. A class of distributed systems used for high-performance computing tasks
* *Cluster computing*. The underlying hardware consists of a collection of similar workstations or PCs running the same OS, closely connected by means of a high-speed LAN
* *Grid computing*. Consist of distributed systems which are often constructed as a federation of computer systems
    
    $\to$ Each computer system may fall under a different administrative domain, and may be very different when it comes to hardware, software. and deployed network technology
* *Cloud computing*. From the perspective of grid computing, a next logical step is to simply outsource the entire infrastructure needed for compute-intensive applications

    $\to$ This is what cloud computing is all about
    * *Idea*. Provide the facilities to dynamically construct an infrastructure and compose what required from available services
    * *Differences from grid computing*. 
        * Grid computing is strongly associated with high-perofmrance computing
        * Cloud computing is much more than just providing lots of resources

### Cluster computing
**Cluster computing**. Used for parallel programming, in which a single, compute intensive program is run in parallel on multiple machines

**Linux-based Beowulf clusters**. Example of a cluster computer

</div>

* *Cluster structure*. Each cluster consists of a collection of compute nodes, which are controlled and accessed by means of a single master node
    * *Master node*. Typically 
        * Handle the allocation of nodes to a particular parallel program
        * Maintain a batch queue of submitted jobs
        * Provide an interface for the users of the system
    * *Middleware for program execution and cluster management*. Actually run by the master
    * *Slave nodes*. Compute nodes equipped with a standard OS extended with typical middleware functions for communication, storage, fault tolerance, etc.

        $\to$ Apart from the master node, the compute nodes are seen to be highly identical

**The MOSIX system**. Example of a cluster compute, which attempts to provide a single-system image of a cluster

$\to$ To a process, a cluster computer offers the ultimate distribution transparency by appearing to be a single computer
* *Idea*. MOSIX provides the high degree of transparency by allowing processes to dynamically and preemptively migrate betwen the nodes making up the cluster
* *Consequence*. Process migration allows a user to start an application on any node, i.e. referred as the home node

    $\to$ After which, it can transparently move to other nodes, e.g. to make efficient use of resources

**Hybrid solutions for modern cluster**. Several modern cluster computers have been moving away from the symmetric architectures to more hybrid solution
* *Symmetric architectures*. Architectures which are fully decentralized
    * *Example*. Fully distributed file systems do not distinguished between the client machines and servers
    * *Idea*. Most proposed systems are based on a distributed hash table (DHT) approach for data distribution across nodes
* *Idea*. The middleware is functionally partitioned across different nodes
* *Advantage*. Having compute nodes with dedicated, lightweight OSes will most likely provide optimal performance for compute-intensive applications
    * *Example*. Storage functionality can most likely be optically handled by other specially configured nodes, e.g. file and directory servers

        $\to$ The same holds for other dedicated middleware services, e.g. job management, database services, etc.
* *Consequence*. This leads to grid computing

### Grid computing
**Motivation**. As previously discussed, there has been a trend towards more hybrid architectures, in which nodes are specially configured for certain tasks
* *Advantage of grid computing*. No assumptions are made concerning similarity of hardware, OSes, networks, administrative domains, security policies, etc.

**Key issue in grid computing**. Resources from different organizations are brought together to allow the collaboration of a group of people from different institutions

$\to$ This forms a federation of systems
* *Virtual organization*. Such a collaboration described above
    * *Access rights*. Processes belonging to the same virtual organization have access rights to the resources provided to that organization
    * *Organization's resources*. Typically computer servers, storage facilities, databases, special networked devices, etc.
* *Consequence*. Much of the software for realizing grid computing evolves around providing access to resources from different administrative domains, and to only those users and applications belonging to a specific virtual organization

    $\to$ Focus is often on architectural issues

**Founding architecture for many grid computing systems**. The architecture consists of four layers

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/T7hmJ87.png">
    <figcaption>A layered architecture for grid computing systems</figcaption>
</div>

* *Fabric layer*. Provide the resources, to which shared access is mediated by grid protocols
    * *Responsibilities*. Provide interfaces to local resources at a specific site
        * *Explain*. Implement the local, resource-specific operations which occur on specific resources, as a result of sharing operations at higher levels

        >**NOTE**. These interfaces are tailored to allow sharing of resources within a virtual organization

    * *Typically provided functions*. 
        * Query the state and capabilities of a resource
        * Functions for actual resource management, e.g. locking resources
* *Connectivity layer*. Consist of communication protocols for supporting grid transactions spanning the usage of multiple resources
    * *Example provided protocols*.
        * Protocols required to transfer data between resources in the fabric layer
        * Protocols required to simply access a resource from a remote location
        * Security protocols to authenticate users and resources

            >**NOTE**. In many cases, human users are not authenticated, but program acting on behalf of the users are authenticated
            >$\to$ Delegating rights from a user to programs is an important function required to be supported in the connectivity layer

* *Resource layer*. Responsible for managing a single resource
    * *Idea*. Use the functions provided by the connectivity layer and calls directly the interfaces provided by the fabric layer
        * *Explain*. 
            * Build on connectivity layer communication and authentication protocols 
            
                $\to$ To provide protocols, APIs, and SDKs, for secure initiation, monitoring, and control of sharing operations on individual resources
            * Call fabric layer functions to access and control local resources

        >**NOTE**. Resource layer protocols are concerned entirely with individual resources, and ignore issues of global state and atomic actions across distributed collections
        >$\to$ Such issues are the concern of the collective layer

    * *Protocols provided*. This layer may offer functions for 
        * *Information protocols*. Obtaining configuration information, current load, usage policy, etc. on a specific resource
        * *Management protocols*.
            * Negotiate access to a shared resource
            * Specify, for example resource requirements, and the operations to be performed, e.g. creating a process or reading data
    * *Consequence*. This layer is seen to be responsible for access control

        $\to$ This layer will rely on the authentication performed as part of the connectivity layer
* *Collective layer*. Deal with handling access to multiple resources
    * *Typically provided services*. Resource discovery, allocation, and scheduling tasks onto multiple resources, data replication, etc.
    * *"Collective" meanings*. This layer indicates that the hardware and software resources are aggregated to run the user applications under the collective operations
* *Application layer*. Consist of the applications operating within a virtual organization, and make use of the grid computing environment

>**NOTE**. Typically, the collective, connectivity, and resource layer form the heart of what could be called wa grid middleware layer
>* *Explain*. These layers jointly provide access to and management of resources which are potentially dispersed across multiple sites

**Similarities between grid computing layers and Internet protocol layers**.

| Grid computing layer | Internet protocol layer |
| --- | --- |
| Application | Application |
| Collective | Application |
| Resource | Application |
| Connectivity | Transport |
| Connectivity | Internet |
| Fabric | Link |

**Administrative unit in grid computing**. From a middleware perspective, in grid computing, the notion of a site, or administrative unit, is common

$\to$ This prevalance is emphasized by the gradual shift toward a service-oriented architecture
* *Service-oriented architecture*. Architecture, in which sites offer access to the various layers through a collection of Web services

    $\to$ This lead to the definition of an alternative architecture known as the Open grid service architecture (OGSA)
* *Open grid service architecture*. Based on the original ideas of four-layer architecture above, and go through a standardization process, thus the architecture is complex
    
    >**NOTE**. OGSA implementations generally follow Web service standards

### Cloud computing
**Problem with computational grids**. Organizations in charge of running data centers were facing the problem of opening up their resources to customers

$t\to$ This lead to the concept of utility computing
* *Utility computing*. A customer can upload tasks to a data center and be charged on a per-resource basis

    $\to$ This is the basis for cloud computing

**Cloud computing**. Characterized by an easily usable and accessible pool of virtualized resources

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TzshR5e.png">
    <figcaption>The organization of clouds</figcaption>
</div>

* *Idea*. Which and how resources are used can be configured dynamically, providing the basis for scalability, i.e. if more work needs to be done, a customer can simply acquire more resources
* *Relation to utility computing*. Cloud computing is generally based on a pay-per-use model, in which guarantees are offered by means of customized service level agreements (SLAs)

**Layers of cloud architecture**. 
* *Hardware*. Formed by the means to manage the necessary hardware, e.g. processors, routers, power, cooling systems, etc.

    $\to$ It is generally implemented at data centers and contains the resources which customers normally never get to see directly
* *Infrastructure*. The backbone for most cloud computing platforms
    * *Responsibility*. Deploy virtualization techniques to provide customers an infrastructure consisting of virtual storage and computing resources

    >**NOTE**. Indeed, cloud computing evolves around allocating and managing virtual storage devices and virtual servers

* *Platform*. Provide to a customer what an OS provides to application developers

    $\to$ The platform layer provides the means to easily develop and deploy applications required to run in a cloud
    * *Practical idea*. 
        * An application developer is offered a vendor-specific API, which includes calls to uploading and executing a program in that vendor's cloud

            $\to$ This is similar to `exec` in Linux, which takes an executable file as parameter and passes it to the OS to be executed
        * The layer provides higher-level abstractions for storage and such, e.g. AMZ S3 storage system provides an API allowing files to be organized and stored in buckets
            * *Bucket*. Somewhat comparable to a directory
* *Application*. Actual applications run in this layer and are offered to users for further customization
      * *Execution*. The applications are executed in the vendor's cloud

**Cloud interfaces**. Cloud-computing providers offer the layers to their customers through various interfaces, leading to several types of services
* *Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)*. Cover the hardware and infrastructure layer
* *Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)*. Cover the platform layer
* *Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)*. Cover the application layer

**Problems with cloud computing**. 
* Provider lock-in ,security and privary issues, and dependency on the availability of services
* The details on how specific cloud computations are actually carried out are generally hidden, even unknown or unpredictable

    $\to$ Meeting performance demands may be impossible to arrange in advance
* Different provides may easily show very different performance profiles

**Future of cloud computing**. Cloud computing is a serious alternative to maintaining huge local infrastructures, thus there is still a lot of room for improvement

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Parallel processing**. High-performance computing more or less started with the introduction of multiprocessor machines

$\to$ Multiple CPUs are organized so that they all have access to the same physical memory
* *Difference from multicomputer system*. In multicomputer systems, several computers are connected through a network, and there is no sharing of main memory
    * *Benefits of shared memory model*. Proved to be highly convenient for improving the performance of programs, and it was relatively easy to program
* *Essence of parallel computing*. Multiple threads of control are executing at the same time, while all threads have access to shared data
    * *Data access*. Controlled through well-understood synchronization mechanisms, e.g. semaphores
    * *Drawback*. The model of shared-memory system does not easily scale
* *High-performance distributed computing*. To overcome the limitations of shared-memory model

    $\to$ Many programs had to make use of message passing instead of modifying shared data as means of communication and synchronization between threads
    * *Message passing model's drawbacks*. Error-prone and much more difficult compared to shared-memory programming models
    * *Consequence*. There has been significant research in attempting to build distributed shared-memory multicomputers (DSM system)
* *DSM system*. Allow a process to address a memory location at another computer, as if it were local memory
    
    $\to$ This can be achieved using existing techniques available to the OS, e.g. memory mapping
    * *Problem*. The performance could never meet the expectations of programmers

        $\to$ Programmers resort to performing message-passing programming models
