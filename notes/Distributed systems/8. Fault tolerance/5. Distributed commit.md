# Distributed commit
**Brief**. The atomic multicasting problem is an example of distributed commit

**Distributed commit problem**. Having an operation being performed by each member of a process group, or none at all

$\to$ This is often established by means of a coordinator

**One-phase commit protocol**. The coordinator tells all other involved processes, i.e. participants, whether or not to locally perform the operation in question
* *Drawback*. There is no way to tell the coordinator if one of the participants cannot actually perform the operation
    * *Example*. In case of distributed transactions, a local commit may not be possible, since this would violate concurrency control constraints

**Two-phase commit protocol**.
* *Scenario*. Consider a distributed transaction involving the participation of several processes, each running on a different machine

    >**NOTE**. Assume that no failures occur

* *Phase 1 - Voting phase*.
    1. The coordinator sends a $\text{vote-request}$ message to all participants
    2. When a participant receives a $\text{vote-request}$ message
        * It returns a $\text{vote-commit}$ message to the coordinator telling the coordinator that it is prepared to locally commit its part of the transaction, or
        * It returns a $\text{vote-abort}$ message
* *Phase 2 - Decision phase*.
    1. The coordinator collects all votes from the participants
    2. If all participants have voted to commit the transaction, so will the coordinator

        $\to$ The coordinator sends a $\text{global-commit}$ message to all participants
    3. If one participant had voted to abort the transaction

        $\to$ The coordinator decides to abort the transaction and multicasts a $\text{global-abort}$ message
    4. Each participant voting for a commit waits the final reaction by the coordinator
        * If a participant receives a $\text{global-commit}$ message

            $\to$ It locally commits the transaction
        * Otherwise, when receiving a $\text{global-abort}$ message

            $\to$ The transaction is locally aborted
* *Drawback*. 2PC cannot efficiently handle the failure of the coordinator
    * *Explain*. The coordinator and the participants have states, in which they block waiting for incoming messages

        $\to$ The protocol can easily fail when a process crashes, i.e. other processes may be indefinitely waiting for a message from the failed process
    * *Solution*. Use timeout mechanisms
* *Consequence*. A 3PC protocol has been developed

**Incoming-message-blocking modes in 2PC**.

* *Cases in which a coordinator or participant is blocked waiting for an incoming message*.
    * *Case 1*. A participant may be waiting in its `INIT` state for a $\text{vote-request}$ message from the coordinator

        $\to$ If the message is not received after some time, the participant locally aborts the transaction and sends $\text{vote-abort}$ message to the coordinator
    * *Case 2*. The coordinator can be blocked in state `WAIT`, waiting for the votes of each participant

        $\to$ If not all votes have been collected after some time, the coordinator votes for an abort, and sends $\text{global-abort}$ to all participants
    * *Case 3*. A participant can be blocked in state `READY`, waiting for the global votes sent by the coordinator

        $\to$ If the message is not recevied within some time, the participant cannot decide to abort the transaction
        * *Consequence*. It must find which message the coordinator sent, e.g. by blocking until the coordinator recovers again
* *Solution*. A participant $P$ can contact another participant $Q$ to see if it can decide from $Q$'s current state what it should do
    * If $Q$ had reached state `COMMIT`, then the coordinator must have sent a $\text{global-commit}$ message to $Q$ before crashing

        $\to$ The message had not been sent to $P$, hence $P$ decides to locally commit
    * If $Q$ is in state `ABORT`, $P$ can safely abort
    * If $Q$ is in state `INIT`, i.e. the coordinator has sent $\text{vote-request}$ to all participants, but the message has reached $P$ but not $Q$

        $\to$ The coordinator had crashed while multicasting $\text{vote-request}$
        * *Consequence*. It is safe to abort the transaction, i.e. both $P$ and $Q$ make a transaction to state `ABORT`
    * If $Q$ is in state `READY`, waiting for a response from the coordinator
        * *Worst case*. If all participants are in state `READY`, no decision can be taken

            $\to$ The protocol blocks until the coordinator recovers

**Process recovery**. To ensure that a process can recover, it must save its state to persistent storage
* *Problem*. When a participant crashed while in state `READY`, then it cannot decide on what it should do next, i.e. commit or abort, after recovery

    $\to$ It is forced to contact other participants to find what it should do
* *Coordinator state logging*. The coordinator has two critical states it needs to keep track of, i.e.
    * When it starts the 2PC protocol, it should record that it is entering state `WAIT`

        $\to$ It can possibly retransmit the $\text{vote-request}$ message to all participants after recovery
    * If it had come to a decision in the second phase, the decision must be recorded for retramission after recovery

**Blocking commit protocol**. A participant will need to block until the coordinator recovers
* *Causes of problem*. When all participants have received and processed the $\text{vote-request}$ message from the coordinator

    $\to$ Meanwhile, the coordinator crashed
    * *Consequence*. Participants cannot cooperatively decide on the final action to take
* *Solution 1*. Use a multicast primitive, by which a receiver immediately multicasts a received message to all other process

    $\to$ This allows a participant to reach a final decision, even if the coordinator has not yet recovered
* *Solution 2*. Use 3PC protocol

**Three-phase commit protocol**. Developed to avoid blocking processes in case of fail-stop crashes

>**NOTE**. 3PC is widely referred to in the literature, but it is not applied often in practice
>
>* *Explain*. The conditions, under which 2PC blocks, rarely occur

* *Key idea*. The states of the coordinator and each participant satisfy the following conditions
    * There is no single state, from which it is possible to make a transition directly to either `COMMIT` or `ABORT` state
    * There is no state, in which it is not possible to make a final decision, and from which a transition to a `COMMIT` state can be made
* *DFAs for 3PC*.

* *Procedure*.
    1. The coordinator sends a $\text{vote-request}$ message to all participants

        $\to$ It then waits for incoming responses
    2. If any participant votes to abort the transaction, the final decision will be abort

        $\to$ The coordinator sends $\text{global-abort}$
    3. When the transaction can be commited, a $\text{prepare-commit}$ message is sent
    4. After each participant has acknowledged it is now prepared to commit

        $\to$ The coordinator send the final $\text{global-commit}$ message, by which the transaction is committed
* *Blocking situations*. There are several situations, in which a process is blocked while waiting for incoming messages
    * *Case 1*. A participant is waiting for a vote request from the coordinator, while residing in the `INIT`

        $\to$ It eventually make a transition to `ABORT`, assuming that the coordinator has crashed
    * *Case 2*. The coordinator is in state `WAIT`, waiting for the votes from participants

        $\to$ It eventually conclude that a participant crashed, hence abort the transaction by multicasting a $\text{global-abort}$ message
    * *Case 3*. The coordinator is blocked in state `PRECOMMIT`, and eventually conclude that some participants had crashed, but it is known to have voted for commiting the transaction

        $\to$ The coordinator can instruct the operational participants to commit by multicasting a $\text{global-commit}$ message
        * *Consequence*. It relies on a recovery protocol for the crashed participant to commit its part of the transaction when it comes up again
    * *Case 4*. A participant $P$ blocks in the `READY` state or in the `PRECOMMIT` state

        $\to$ It eventually conclude that the coordinator has failed, hence it needs to find out what to do next
        * *Consequence*. $P$ contacts any other participant, which is in state `COMMIT` or `ABORT`, and move to the corresponding state
            * If all participants are in state `PRECOMMIT`, the transaction can be committed
            * If another participant $Q$ is still in `INIT`, the transaction can safely aborted
                * *Explain*. $Q$ can be in `INIT` only if no other participant is in `PRECOMMIT`, i.e.
                    * A participant can reach `PRECOMMIT` only if the coordinator had reached `PRECOMMIT` before crashing

                        $\to$ It has received a vote to commit from each participant
            * If each participants, which $P$ can contact, is in `READY` state, and they form a majority

                $\to$ The transaction should be aborted
                * *Explain*. Another participant may have crashed, and will later recover
            * If the processes $P$ can reach are in `PRECOMMIT`, and they form a majority

                $\to$ It is safe to commit the transaction
