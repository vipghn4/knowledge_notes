# Design goals
## Supporting resource sharing
**Supporting resource sharing**. Make it easy for users and applications to access and share remote resources
* *Resources*. Can be virtually anything, e.g. peripherals, storage facilities, data, files, services, and networks, etc.
* *Benefits*.
    * More economical distributed system, e.g. it is cheaper to have a single high-end reliable storage facility be shared
    * Connecting users and resources also makes it easier to collaborate and exchange information
* *Successful examples*. File-sharing P2P networks

## Making distribution transparent
**Transparent resource distribution**. An important goal of a distributed system is to hide the fact that its processes and resources are physically distributed across multiple computers, possibly seperated by large distances

$\to$ We try to make the distribution of processes and resources transparent, i.e. invisible, to end users and applications

### Types of distribution transparency
**Access transparency**. Hide differences in data representation and how an object is accessed
* *Basic level*. Hide differences in machine architectures
* *More important level*. Agree on how data is to be represented by different machines, and OSes
* *Example*. A distributed system may have computer systems running different OSes, each having their own file-naming conventions

**Location transparency**. Hide where an object is located physically
* *Naming*. Play an important role in achieving location transparency
    * *Explain*. Location transparency can often be achieved by assigning only logical names to resources
* *Logitcal name*. Names, in which the location of a resource is not secretly encoded
    * *Example*. Use Uniform resource locator (URL)

**Relocation transparency**. Hide that an object may be moved to another location while in use

>**NOTE**. This is becoming increasingly important in the context of cloud computing

**Migration transparency**. Hide that an object may move to another location

$\to$ This is used when the distributed system supports the mobility of processes and resources initiated by users, without affecting ongoing communication and operations
* *Example*. Regardless whether two people are actually moving, mobile phones will allow them to continue their conversation

**Replication transparency**. Hide an object is replicated
* *Requirements*. To hide replication from users, it is necessary that all replicas have the same name

    $\to$ A system supporting replication transparency should generally support location transparency as well
    * *Explain*.It would otherwise be impossible to refer to replicas at different locations

**Concurrency transparency**. Hide that an object may be shared by several independent users
* *Motivation*. An important goal of distributed system is to allow sharing of resources

    $\to$ It is important that each user does not notice that the other is making use of the same resource
* *Resource consistency*. Concurrent accesses to a shared resource should leave that resource in a consistent state
    * *Idea*. By locking mechanism, or to use transactions

    >**NOTE**. It may be difficult to implement transactions in a distributed system, notably when scalability is an issue

**Failure transparency**. Hide the failure and recovery of an object, i.e.
* *Explain*.
    * A user or application does not notice that some piece of the system fails to work properly
    * The system subsequently, and automatically, recovers from failure
* *Masking failures*. One of the hardest issues in distributed systems, and is even impossible when certain apparently realistic assumptions are made
* *Main difficulty*. The inability to distinguish between a dead process and a painfully slowly responding once
    * *Example*. When contacting a busy Web server, a browser will eventually time out and report that the Web page is unavailable

        $\to$ The user cannot tell whether the server is actually down or that the network is badly congested

### Degree of distribution transparency
**Problem**. There are situations, in which attempting to blindly hide all distribution aspects from users is not a good idea
* *Explain*,
    * Some distributed aspects cannot be hidden, due to external reasons, or due to the proper functionality of the system 
    * Due to trade-off between a high degree of transparency and the performance of a system
* *Examples*.
    * *Example 1*. If we request our electronic newspaper to appear in our mailbox before 7 AM local time, when we are living at a different time zone
    * *Example 2*. When we ask for a message to be transmitted from San Francisco to Amsterdam within less than 35 milliseconds
    * *Example 3*. Many Internet applications repeatedly try to contact a server before finally giving up

        $\to$ Attempting to mask a transient server failure may slow down the system as a whole
    * *Example 4*. When we need to guarantee that several replicas located on different continents must be consistent all the time

**Distribution exposure**. As distributed systems are expanding to small devices, where the notion of location and context awareness is very important

$\to$ It may be best to actually expose distribution
* *Example*. Location-based services

**Pseudo distribution transparency**. Full distribution transparency is impossible

$\to$ Is it even wise to pretend that we can achieve it?
* *Idea*. It may be much better to make distribution explicit so that the user and developer are never tricked into believing that there is transparency
* *Consequence*. Users will much better understand the behavior, i.e. sometimes unexpected, of a distributed system

    $\to$ The user can be much better prepared to deal with this behavior

**Conclusion**. Aiming for distribution transparency may be a nice goal when designing and implementing distributed systems

$\to$ But it should be considered together with other issues, e.g. performance and comprehensibility

## Being open
**Openness**. Another important goal of distributed systems

**Open distributed system**. A system that
* Offer components which can easily be used by, or integrated into other systems
* Consist of components originating from elsewhere

### Interoperability, composability, and extensibility
**Interfaces and interface definition language (IDL)**. To be open means that components should adhere to standard rules, which describe the syntax and semantics of what those components have to offer
* *General approach*. Define services through interfaces, using an IDL
    * *Motivation*. Interface definitions written in an IDL nearly always capture only the syntax of services

        $\to$ They specify precisely the names of functions available, together with parameter types, return value types, possible exceptions which can be raised, etc.
    * *Hard part*. Specify precisely what those services do, i.e. the semantics of interfaces

        >**NOTE**. In practice, such specifications are given in an informal way, by means of natural language

* *Benefits of a properly specified interface definition*.
    * Allow an arbitrary process, which needs a certain interface, to talk to another process, which provides that interface
    * Allow two independent parties to build completely different implementations of the interfaces, leading to two separate components operating in exactly the same way

**Completeness and neutrality**. Proper specifications are complete and neutral
* *Completeness*. Everything necessary to make an implementation has been specified

    >**NOTE**. Many interface definitions are not all complete, thus it is necessary for a developer to add implementation-specific details

* *Neutrality*. Specifications do not prescribe what an implementation should look like, i.e. the should be neutral

**Interoperability and portability**. Completeness and neutrality are important for interoperability and portability
* *Interoperability*. Characterize the extent, by which two implementations of systems or components from different manufacturers can co-exist and work together by relying on each other's services as specified by a common standard
* *Portability*. Characterize to what extent an application developed for a distributed A can be executed, without modification, on a different distributed system B, which implements the same interfaces as A

**Other important goals for an open distributed system**.
* *Configurability*. It should be easy to configure the system out of different components, possibly from different developers
* *Extensibility*. It should be easy to add new components or replace existing ones without affecting those components which stay in place

### Separating policy from mechanism
**Replacibility and adaptibility**. To achieve flexibility in open distributed systems, it is crucial that the system be organized as a collection of relatively small and easily replaceable or adaptable components

$\to$ We should provide definitions of both the highest-level interfaces, i..e those seen by users and applications, and the interfaces to internal parts of the system and how those parts interact

>**NOTE**. This approach is relatively new

* *Old approaches*. Many older and even contemporary systems are constructed using a monolithic approach, in which components are only logically separated but implemented as one, huge program
    * *Drawback*. Hard to replace or adapt a component without affecting the entire system
    * *Consequence*. Monolithic systems are tend to be closed instead of open

**The need for changing a distributed system**. Often caused by a component, which does not provide optimal policy for a specific user or application
* *Policy*. Ways to choose which activities to perform
    * *Example*. A process may be granted resources using FIFS policy
* *Mechanism*. Implementations which enforce policies
    * *Example*. FIFS policy may be implemented by using a queue of requests

## Being scalable
**Scalability**. One of the most important design goals for developers for distributed systems

### Scalability dimensions
**Scalability dimensions**. 
* *Size scalability*. A system can be scalable w.r.t its size, i.e. we can easily add more users and resources to the system without any noticeable loss of performance
* *Geographical scalability*. The users and resoures may lie far apart, but the fact that communication delays may be significant is hardly noticed
* *Administrative scalability*. A system which can still be easily managed even if it spans many independent administrative organizations

#### Size scalability
**Problems with size scalability**.
* *Problem 1*. If more users or resources need to be supported, we are often confronted with the limitations of centralized services
    * *Example*. Many services are centralized by being implemented within a single server running on a specific machine in a distributed system

## Pitfalls
**Distributed system and traditional software differences**. Components of a distributed system are dispersed across a network

$\to$ Not taking this dispersion into account during design time is what makes so many systems needlessly complex and results in flaws which need to be patched later on

**Eight common wrong assumptions for distributed systems**.
* The network is reliable
* The network is secure
* The network is homogeneous
* The topology does not change
* Latency is zero
* Bandwidth is infinite
* Transport cost is zero
* There is one administrator

**Affected properties of distributed systems by wrong assumptions**. 
* Reliability, security, heterogeneity, and topology of the network
* Latency and bandwidth
* Transport costs
* Administrative domains

## Discussions
**Against distribution transparency**. Several researchers argued that hiding distribution will only lead to complicating the development of distributed systems
* *Explain*. Full distribution transparency can never be achieved
* *Against RPC*. Access transparency is achieved via RPC

    $\to$ This can lead to poorly understood semantics
    * *Explain*. A RPC may result in unexpected outputs when executed over a faulty communication link
    * *Consequence*. If reliability of communication cannot be guaranteed

        $\to$ It is best to always perform only local executions, leading to copy-before-use principle
* *Copy-before-use principle*. Data can be accessed only after they have been transferred to the machine of the process wanting the data
* *Data modification*. Modifying a data item should not be done, it can only be updated to a new version instead

**Open distribution in practice**. 
* *Practical observations*. Practice shows that 
    * Many distributed systems are not as open as we would like
    * Still a lot of effort is required to put various bits and pieces together to make a distributed system
* *Naive soltuion*. Reveal all the gory details of a component and provide developers with the actual source code

    $\to$ This approach is becoming increasingly popular, leading to open source projects
* *Object source projects*. Projects where large groups of people contribute to improving and debugging systems

**Distributed system concern and networking concern**. Distributed system does not concern about security while networking does
