# Location systems
**Problems with large distributed systems dispersed across a WAN**. It is necessary to take proximity into account
* *Explain*. Consider a distributed system organized as an overlay network, in which two processes are neighbors in the overlay network, but are actually placed far apart in the underlying network

    $\to$ If these processes communicate a lot, it may have been better to ensure that they are physically placed in each other's proximity

## GPS - Global positioning system
**Global positioning system (GPS)**. A highly specific, dedicated distributed system for solving the positioning problem
* *GPS*. A satellite-based distributed system, which was launched in 1978, initially for military applications

    $\to$ This is by now has found its way to many civilian applications, notably for traffic navigation
    * *Idea*. Use up to 72 satellites, each circulating in an orbit at a height of approximately 20,000 km
        * *GPS satellite*. Each has up to four atomic clocks, which are regularly calibrated from special stations on Earth
    * *Positioning*. A satellite continuously broadcasts its position, and time stamps each message with its local time 

        $\to$ This allows every receiver on Earth to accurately compute its own position, using, in principle, only four satellites
* *Position computation*.
    * *2D case*. Consider three satellites below, with the circles representing points at the same distance from each respective satellite

        $\to$ The intersection of the three circles is a unique point

        </div>

    * *3D case*. The principle of intersecting circles can be expanded to 3D, i.e. we need to know the distance to four satellites to determine the longitude, latitude, and altitude of a receiver on Earth

**Distance-to-satellite determination**. Become complicated when we move from theory to practice
* *Real-world problems*.
    * It takes a while before data on a satellite's position reaches the receiver
    * The receiver's clock is generally not in sync with that of a satellite
* *Assumptions*.
    * The timestamp from a satellite is completely accurate
    * $\Delta_r$ is the deviation of the receiver's clock from the actual time
    * A message is received from satellite $S_i$ with timestamp $T_i$
    * $T_\text{now}$ is the actual current time
    * $c$ is the speed of light, i.e. the speed, at which signals travel
    * $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ is the coordinates of satellite $S_i$
* *Measured delay $\Delta_i$ by the receiver*. Consist of two components, i.e. the actual delay, and its own deviation

    $$\Delta_i = (T_\text{now} - T_i) + \Delta_r$$
* *Real distance $d_i$ to satellite $S_i$*. $d_i = c\cdot (T_\text{now} - T_i)$
* *Measured distance $\tilde{d}_i$ to satellite $S_i$*. $\tilde{d}_i = c\cdot \Delta_i = d_i + c\cdot \Delta_r$
* *Formulation of real distance w.r.t measured distance*. 
    
    $$d_i(x_r, y_r, z_r, \Delta_r) = \tilde{d}_i - c\cdot \Delta_r = \sqrt{(x_i - x_r)^2 + (y_i - y_r)^2 + (z_i - z_r)^2}$$

    * *Conclusion*. We have four unknowns $x_r,y_r,z_r,\Delta_r$, hence we need four reference points, i.e. satellites, to find a unique solution

        $\to$ A GPS measurement thus also give an account of the actual time

**Error in GPS**.
* *Sources of errors*. There are many sources of errors, e.g.
    * The atomic clocks in the satellites are not always in perfect sync
    * The position of a satellite is not known precisely
    * The receiver's clock has a finite accuracy
    * The signal propagation speed is not constant
* *Consequence*. Special modulation techniques, and special receivers, are required to improve accuracy
    * *Example*. Differential GPS, i.e. corrective information is sent through wide-area links to improve accuracy

## When GPS is not an option
**Major drawback of GPS**. GPS can generally not be used indoors

$\to$ Other techniques are necessary
* *Solution*. Use numerous WiFi access points available
    * *Basic idea*. If we have a database of known access points, along with their coordinates

        $\to$ We can estimate our distance to an access point
        * *Consequence*. With only three detected access points, we should be able to compute our position
    * *Problem*. In practice, this is not simple

**Major problem with WiFi access points**. A major problem is determining the coordinates of an access point
* *War driving*. A popular approach to estimate the coordinates of an access point
    * *Idea*. Using a WiFi-enabled device with a GPS receiver, someone drives or walks through an area and records observed access points
        * *Access point identification*. Use access point's SSID or its MAC-level network address
        * *Requirement*. An access point AP should be detected at several locations, before its coordinates can be estimated
    * *Access point location estimation*. Compute the centroid of recorded locations
        * *Assumptions*.
            * $\{\vec{x}_1,\dots,\vec{x}_N\}$ are $N$ different locations
            * Each location $\vec{x}_i$ consists of a latitude-longitude pair as provided by the GPS receiver
        * *AP location estimation*. $\vec{x}_\text{AP} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \vec{x}_i$
* *Accuracy improvement*. Accuracy can be improved by taking the observed signal strength into account, and giving more weight to a location with relatively high observed signal strength than to a location with weak signal

    $\to$ In the end, we obtain an estimation of the coordinates of the access point
* *Influencers of estimation accuracy*.
    * The accuracy of each GPS detection point $\vec{x}_i$
    * The fact that an access point has nonuniform transmission range
    * The number of sampled detection points $N$
* *Statistics of access point estimation*.
    * Estimates of the coordinates of an access point may be tens of meters off from the actual location
    * Access points come and go at a relatively high rate
    * Locating and positioning access points is widely popular

## Logical positioning of nodes
**Logical positioning of nodes**. Instead of trying to find the absolute location of a node in a distributed system, an alternative is to use a logical, proximity-based location
* *Geometric overlay networks*. Each node is given a position in an $m$-dimensional geometric space
    
    $\to$ So that the distance between two nodes in that space reflects a real-world performance metric
* *Network coordinates system (NCS)*. Computing such a position in geometric overlay networks is the core business of a NCS
    * *Simple distance formulation*. Distance corresponds to internode latency, i.e. given two nodes $P$ and $Q$

        $\to$ The distance $\hat{d}(P, Q)$ reflects how long it would take for a message to travel from P to Q and vice versa
* *Applications*.
    * *Case 1*. Consider the situation, where a Web site at server $O$ has been replicated to multiple servers $S_1,\dots,S_N$ on the Internet
        * *Page request*. When a client $C$ requests a page from $O$, the latter may decide to redirect the request to the server closest to $C$

            $\to$ $O$ will pick a server $S_i$, for which $\hat{d}(C,\S_i)$ is minimal
        
        >**NOTE**. Replica selection requires only local processing at $O$
    *Case 2 - Optimal replica placement*. Consider a Web site, which has gathered positions of its clients

        $\to$ If the site were to replicate its content to $N$ servers, it can compute the $N$ best positions, where to place replicas so that the average client-to-replica response time is minimal
        * *Requirements*. Clients and servers have geometric positions reflecting internode latencies
    * *Case 3 - Position-based routing*. A message is forwarded to its destination using only positioning information
        * *Example*. A naive routing algorithm is to let each node forward a message to the neighbor closest to the destination

### Centralized positioning
**Key observation**. Positioning a node in an $m$-dimensional geometric space requires $m+1$ distance measures to nodes with known positions, i.e. as in GPS
* *Location estimation*. Assuming node $P$ wants to compute its own position, it contacts three other nodes with known positions and measures its distance to each of them
    * *Intuition*.
        * Contacting only one node would tell $P$ about the cirle it is located on
        * Contacting only two nodes would tell $P$ about the position of the intersection of two circles, i.e. two points
        * Contacting three nodes would allow $P$ to compute its actual location
    * *Assumptions*.
        * $\tilde{d}$ is the measured, or estimated distance, e.g. latency
        * $(x_P,y_P)$ is the location of $P$
    * *Location determination of $P$*. Solve the three quadratic equations with two unknowns $x_P,y_P$

        $$\forall i\in\{1,2,3\},\tilde{d}_i=\sqrt{(x_i-x_P)^2 + (y_i-y_P)^2}$$
* *Problems*. $\tilde{d}_i$ can be different over time, i.e. 
    * There is a different positioning whenever $P$ wants to recompute its position
    * If other nodes would use $P$'s current position to compute their own coordinates

        $\to$ The error in positioning $P$ will affect the accuracy of the positioning of other nodes
    * The measured distances between a set of nodes will generally not even be consistent, e.g. triangle inequality may not hold, i.e.

        $$d(P,R) \leq d(P,Q) + d(Q,R)$$

        may not hold for any arbitrary three nodes $P,Q,R$

        >**NOTE**. It is generally impossible to resolve inconsistencies completely

**Solving for inconsistency**. Use $N$ special nodes $L_1,\dots,L_N$, i.e. landmarks
* *Idea*. Landmarks measure their pairwise latencies $\tilde{L_i,L_j}$ and subsequently let a central node compute the coordinates for each landmark
    
    $\to$ The central node seeks to minimize the following objective function

    $$\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^N \bigg(\frac{\tilde{d}(L_i,L_j) - \hat{d}(L_i,L_j)}{\tilde{d}(L_i,L_j)}\bigg)^2$$

    where $\hat{d}(\cdot,cdot)$ is the distance after two nodes have been positioned
* *Hyperparameters*. The dimension $m$
    * *Rule-of-thumb*. With well-chosen landmarks, $m$ can be as small as $6$ or $7$, with $\hat{d}(P,Q)$ being no more than a factor $2$ different from the actual latency $d(P,Q)$ for arbitrary nodes $P$ and $Q$

### Decentralized positioning
**Idea**. View the collection of nodes as a huge system, in which nodes are attached to each other through springs

$\to$ $|\tilde{d}(P,Q) - \hat{d}(P,Q)|$ indicates to what extent nodes $P$ and $Q$ are displced, relative to the situation, in which the system of springs would be at rest
* *Consequence*. By letting each node slightly change its position, the system will eventually converge to an optimal organization, in which the aggregated error is minimal

**Implementation**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $P_1,\dots,P_N$ are $N$ nodes in the system
    * $\tilde{d}(P_i,P_j)$ is the measured distance, i.e. latency, between nodes $P_i$ and $P_j$
    * $\hat{d}(P_i,P_j)$ is the distance computed from the network coordinates of each node
    * $\vec{x}_i$ is the coordinates of $P_i$
    * $u(\vec{x}_i - \vec{x}_j)$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\vec{x}_i - \vec{x}_j$
* *Objective function*. $\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^N |\tilde{d}(P_i,P_j) - \hat{d}(P_i,P_j)|^2$
* *Force $P_i$ exerts on $P_j$*. If each node is placed in a geometric space, then the force is given as

    $$\vec{F}_{ij} = (\tilde{d}(P_i,P_j) - \hat{d}(P_i,P_j)) \cdot u(\vec{x}_i - \vec{x}_j)$$

    * *Intuition*. $u$ acts as an radius vector, and $\tilde{d}(P_i,P_j) - \hat{d}(P_i,P_j)$ acts as negative torque vector
    * *Consequence*. If $F_{ij} > 0$, then $P_i$ pushes $P_j$ away from itself, otherwise pull toward itself
* *Distance estimation*. Node $P_i$ repeatedly executes the following steps
    1. Measure the latency $\tilde{d}_{ij}$ to node $P_j$, and also receive $P_j$'s coordinates $\vec{x}_j$
    2. Compute the force $F_{ij}$
    3. Adjust its own position by moving along the force vector, i.e. $\vec{x}_i = \vec{x}_i + \delta \cdot \vec{u}$
* *Choice of $\delta$*. Use an adaptive value, which is large when the error is large, but small when only small adjustments are required
    * Too large $\delta$ will oscillate the system
    * Too small $\delta$ will take time for the system to converge to a stable situation
