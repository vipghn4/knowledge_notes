# Gossip-based coordination
## Aggregation
**Applications of gossiping**. 
* Spreading updates, i.e. he most widely-deployed application of gossip-based coordination
* Discover nodes having a few outgoing wide-area links, to subsequently apply directional gossiping
* Collecting, i.e. aggregating, information

**Information aggregation with gossiping**.
* *Information exchange scenario*.
    * Every node $P_i$ initially chooses an arbitrary number $v_i$
    * When $P_i$ contacts $P_j$, they each update their value as $v_i,v_j=(v_i + v_j)/2$

        $\to$ Eventually, all nodes will have the same value, i.e. the average of all initial values
* *Special case*. When all nodes $P_i$ set $v_i$ to zero, except for $P_1$, who set $v_1$ to $1$, i.e.

    $$v_i = \begin{cases}1 & i=1\\ 0 & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$

    * *Consequence*. If there are $N$ nodes, then eventually each node will compute the average, i.e. $1/N$

        $\to$ Every node $P_i$ can estimate the size of the system as being $1/v_i$
* *Computing average in dynamic systems*. Computing the average may prove to be difficult when nodes regularly join and leave the system
    * *Solution*. Introduce epochs, i.e. if node $P_1$ is stable, it simply starts a new epoch now and then

        $\to$ When $P_i$ sees a new epoch for the first time, it resets $v_i$ to zero, and starts computing the average again
    * *Variations*. Instead of having a fixed node, e.g. $P_1$, start the computation of the average

        $\to$ We can pick a random node to start the computation, i.e.
        1. Each node $P_i$ initially sets $v_i$ to a random number from the same interval, e.g. $(0,1]$, and stores it permanently as $m_i$
        2. Upon an exchange between nodes $P_i$ and $P_j$, each change their value to

            $$v_i,v_j=\max\{v_i,v_j\}$$

            $\to$ Each node $P_i$, for which $m_i<v_i$ will lose the competition for being the initiator in starting the computation of the average
        3. Finally, there will be a single winner
    * *Problem*. It is difficult to decide a node has won, as it remains uncertain whether all results have come in
        * *Solution*. A node always assumes it is the winner until proven otherwise

            $\to$ At this point, it simply resets the variable it is using for computing the average to zero

## A peer-sampling service
**Peer-sampling problem**. The ability of a node $P$ to choose another node $Q$ at random, from all available nodes in the network
* *Problem*. When the network consists of thousands of nodes, how can $P$ pick one of these nodes at random, without having a complete overview of the network
* *Solution for small networks*. Nodes often resort to a central service, which had registered every participating node
    * *Drawback*. This solution cannot scale to large networks

**Peer-sampling service (PSS)**. A solution to peer-sampling problem
* *Idea*. Construct a fully decentralized peer-sampling service, using an epidemic protocol, i.e.
    * *Partial view*. Each node maintains a list of $c$ neighbors, where, ideally, each of these neighbors represents a randomly chosen live node from the current set of nodes

        $\to$ This list of neighbors is referred to as a partial view
* *Partial view construction*. 
    * *Assumption*. 
        * Nodes regularly exchange entries from their partial view
        * Each entry identifies another node in the network, and has an associated age indicating how old the reference to the node is
    * *Pseudo code*. Two threads are used

        </div>

        * *Selection operations*.
            * *`selectPeer`*. Randomly select a neighbor from the local partial view
            * *`selectToSend`*. Select some other entries from the partial view, and add to the list intended for the selected neighbor
            * *`selectToKeep`*. Add received entries to partial view, remove repeated items, shrink view to $c$ items
        * *Construction of a new partial view*. This view, for contacting and contacted peer, will contain exactly $c$ entries, part of which will come from the received list
            * *Approach 1*. The two nodes may decide to discard the entries, which they had sent to each other

                $\to$ The two nodes will swap part of their original views
            * *Approach 2*. Discard as many old entries as possible
* *Consequence*. As along as peers regularly run the exchanging algorithm

    $\to$ Selecting a random peer from a dynamically changing partial view is indistinguishable from randomly selecting a peer from the entire network

## Gossip-based overlay construction
**Key observation**. By carefully exchanging and selecting entries from partial views, it is possible to construct and maintain specific topologies of overlay networks

$\to$ This topology management is achieved by adopting a two-layered approach

    <figcaption>A two-layered approach for constructing and maintaining specific overlay topologies using techniques from unstructured P2P systems</figcaption>
</div>

* *Lowest layer*. Constitute an unstructured P2P system, in which nodes periodically exchange entries of their partial views, with the aim to provide a PSS
    * *Accuracy*. Accuracy in this case refers to the fact that the partial view should be filled with entries referring to randomly selected live nodes
* *Higher layer*. The lowest layer passes its partial view to the higher layer, where an additional selection of entries take place

    $\to$ This leads to a second list of neighbors corresponding to the desired topology
    * *Ranking function*. Proposed by Jelasity and Kermarrec, where nodes are ordered according to some criterion relative to a given node
        * *Simple function*. Based on distance function

            $\to$ A node will gradually build up a list of its nearest neighbors, provided the lowest layer continues to pass randomly selected nodes
