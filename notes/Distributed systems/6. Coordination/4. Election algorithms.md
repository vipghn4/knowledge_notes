# Election algorithms
**Problem**. Many distributed algorithms require one process to act as coordinator, initiator, or otherwise perform some special role

$\to$ No matter which process takes on this responsibility, one of them has to do it
* *Election algorithm for uniform processes*. If all processes are exactly the same, with no distinguishing characteristics, then there is no way to select one of them to be special
    * *Assumptions*.
        * Each process $P$ has a unique identifier $\text{id}(P)$\
        * Every process knows the ID of every other process

            $\to$ Each proces has complete knowledge of the process group, in which a coordinator must be elected
        * Processes do not know which ones are currently up, and which ones are currently down
    * *Idea*. Locate the process, with the highest identifier and designate it as coordinator

        $\to$ The algorithms differ in the way they locate the coordinator
    * *Goal*. Ensure that when an election starts, it concludes with all processes agreeing on who the new coordinator is to be

## The bully algorithm
**The bully algorithm**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $\{P_0,\dots,P_{N-1}\}$ are $N$ processes with $P_k$ having ID $\text{id}(P_k) = k$
* *Election procedure*. When any process $P_k$ notices that the coordinator is no longer responding to requests, it initiates an election, i.e.
    1. $P_k$ sends an `ELECTION` message to all processes with higher identifiers $P_{k+1},\dots,P_{N-1}$
    2. If no one responds, $P_k$ wins the election and becomes coordinator
    3. If one of the higher-ups answers, it takes over and $P_k$'s job is done
* *Reaction to `ELECTION` messages*. At any moment, a process can get an `ELECTION` message from one of its lower-numbered colleagues

    $\to$ When such a message arrives, 
    1. The receiver sends an `OK` message back to the sender to indicate that he is alive and will take over
    2. The receiver holds an election, unless it is already holding one
    3. Eventually, all processes give up but one, and that one is the new coordinator
    4. The coordinator announces its victory by sending all processes a message telling them that starting immediately it is the new coordinator
* *Recovery of previous coordinator*. If a process, which was previously down comes back up, it holds an election

    $\to$ If the process is the highest-numbered process currently running, it will win the election, and take over the coordinator's job
* *"Bully" meaning*. The biggest guy in town always wins

## A ring algorithm
**Ring algorithm**. Based on the use of a logical ring
* *Assumptions*. Each process knows who its successor is
* *Election procedure*. 
    1. When any process notices that the coordinator is not functioning
        
        $\to$ It builds an `ELECTION` message containing its own process ID and sends the message to its successor
    2. If the successor is down, the sender skips over the successor and goes to the next member along the ring, or the one after that

        $\to$ This repeats until a running process is located
    3. At each step along the way, the sender adds its own ID to the list in the message effectively making itself a candidate to be elected as coordinator
    4. Eventually, the message gets back to the process who started it all

        $\to$ The message type is changed to `COORDINATOR` and circulated once again, informing everyone else who the coordinator is, i.e. the list member with highest ID, and who the members of the new ring are
    5. When this message has circulated once, it is removed and everyone goes back to work

## Elections in wireless environments
**Traditional election algorithms in wireless environments**. Based on assumptions that are not realistic in wireless environments
* *Examples*. Message passing is assumed to be reliable and the topology of the network does not change
* *Solution*. Only few protocols for elections have been developed, which work in ad hoc networks
    * *Vasudevan et. al.*. Propose a solution, which can handle failing nodes and partitioning networks
        * *Key property*. The best leader can be elected rather than just a random one as was more  or less the case in traditional election algorithms

**Vasudevan et. al.**.
* *Procedure*. Consider a wireless ad hoc network, then
    1. To elect a leader, any node in the network, i.e. the source, can initiate an election by sending an `ELECTION` message to its immediate neighbors, i.e. the nodes in its range
    2. When a node receives an `ELECTION`, it handles the message as following
        * If the node receives an `ELECTION` message for the first time, it designates the sender as its parent
 
            $\to$ The node then sends out an `ELECTION` message to all its immediate neighbors, except for the parent
            * *Explain*. When node R has designated node Q as its parent, 
                1. It forwards the `ELECTION` message to its immediate neighbors, excluding Q
                2. R then waits for acknowledgments to come in, before acknowledging the `ELECTION` message from Q
            * *Consequence*.
                * Neighbors, who have already selected a parent, will immediately respond to R
                * If all neighbors have already have a parent, R is a leaf node, and will be able to report back to Q quickly
                * R will also report information, e.g. battery lifetime and other resource capacities, to Q

                    $\to$ This information later allows Q to compare R's capacities to that of other downstream nodes, and select the best eligible node for leadership
                * The response will be backward propagated to the source, telling it which node is best to be selected as leader
        * If the node receives an `ELECTION` message from a node, other than its parent, it merely acknowledges the receipt
    3. The source, after knowing which node is best to be the leader, will broadcast the information to all other nodes
* *Multiple elections*. When multiple elections are initiated, each node will decide to join only one election

    $\to$ Each source tags its `ELECTION` message with a unique identifier, and nodes will participate only in the election with the highest identifier, stopping any running participation in other elections
* *Adjustment*. With some minor adjustments, the protocol can be shown to operate also when the network partitions, and when nodes join and leave. as given by Vasudevan et. al.

## Elections in large-scale systems
**Problem**. Many leader-election algorithms apply to only relatively small distributed systems, and algorithms often concentrate on the selection of only a single node

$\to$ There are situations, when several nodes should be selected, i.e. super peers in P2P networks
* *Requirements on super-peer selection algorithms*. The following requirements are relatively easy to meet in most P2P systems, given that the overlay network is structured, or randomly unstructured
    1. Normal nodes should have low-latency access to super peers
    2. Super peers should be evenly distributed across the overlay network
    3. There should be a predefined portion of super peers relative to the total number of nodes in the overlay network
    4. Each super peer should not need to serve more than a fixed number of normal nodes
* *Example*. In DHT-based system

**Solutions**.
* *DHT-based system*. Reserve a fraction of the identifier space for super peers
    
$\to$ Each node receives a random and uniformly assigned $m$-bit identifiere
    * *Example*. We may reserve the first, i.e. leftmost, $k$ bits to identify super peers

        $\to$ If we need $N$ super peers, then first $\lceil \log_2 (N) \rceil$ bits of any key can be used to identify these nodes
* *Node positioning in an $m$-dimensional geometric space*. Suppose we need to place $N$ super peers evenly throughout the overlay

        <figcaption>Moving tokens in 2D space using repulsion forces</figcaption>
    </div>

    * *Basic idea*. A total of $N$ tokens are spread across $N$ randomly chosen nodes, with no node hold more than one token

        $\to$ Each token represents a repelling force, by which another token is inclined to move away
        * *Consequence*. If all tokens exert the same repulsion force, they will move away from each other, and spread themselves evenly in the geometric space
    * *Requirement*. Nodes holding a token must learn about other tokens
    * *Implementation*. Use a gossiping protocol, by which a token's force is disseminated throughout the network

        $\to$ If a node discovers that the total forces acting on it exceed a threshold, it will move the token in the direction of the combined forces
        * *Super peer election*. When a token is held by a node for a given amount of time

            $\to$ The node will promote itself to super peer
