# Architectural styles
**Software architecture for distributed systems**. Designing or adopting an architecture is crucial for the successful development of large software systems
* *Architectural style*. A style is formulated in terms of 
    * Components of the architecture
    * The way components are connected to each other
    * The data exchanged between components
    * How these things are jointly configured into a system
* *Component*. A modular unit with well-defined required and provided interfaces, which is replaceable within its environment
    * *Replaceability*. While a system continues to operate, a component can be replaced
        * *Importance*. This is important, since in many cases, it is not an option to shutdown a system for maintenance
            
            $\to$ At best, only parts of it may be put temporarily out of order
        * *Requirements for replaceability*. Replacing a component can be done only if its interfaces remain untouched
* *Connector*. A mechanism mediating communciation, coordination, or cooperation among components
    * *Example*. A connector can be formed by the facilities for RPCs, message massing, or streaming data
    
        $\to$ A connector allows for the flow of control and data between components

**Architectural styles from components and connectors**. Several styles have by now been identified, of which the most important ones for distributed systems are
* Layered architectures, i.e. commonly used in computer networking
* Object-based architectures
* Resource-centered architectures
* Event-based architectures, i.e. as in Gstreamer

>**NOTE**. In real-world distributed systems, many different styles are combined

## Layered architectures
**Basic idea**. Components are organized in a layered fashion, where a component at layer $L_j$ can make downcall to a component at a lower layer $L_i$ where $i < j$ and generally expects a response
* *Exceptions*. Only in exceptional cases will an upcall be made to a higher-level component

**Common cases**.

    <figcaption>Common cases of layered arcchitectures</figcaption>
</div>

* *Standard organization*. Only downcalls to the next lower layer are made, as illustrated in figure (a)
    * *Usage*. Commonly deployed in network communciation
* *One-way call*. Downcalls to arbitrary lower layers are made, as illustrated in figure (b)
* *Upcall allowed*. In some cases, it is convenient to have a lower layer do an upcall to its next higher layer
    * *Example*. When an OS signals the occurrence of an event, to which end it calls a user-defined operation, for which an application had previously passed a reference, i.e. a handle

### Layered communication protocols
**Communication-protocol stacks**. A well-knwon and ubiquitously applied layered architecture

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/oH3CLtk.png">
    <figcaption>A layered communication-protocol stack</figcaption>
</div>

* *Communication services*. Each layer implements one or several communication services allowing data to be sent from a destination to one or several targets
* *Interface*. Each layer offers an interface specifying the functions which can be called

    $\to$ In principle, the interface should completely high the actual implementation of a service
* *Communication protocol*. Describe the rules which parties will follow to exchange information

**Example**. TCP in networking

### Application layering
**Scenario**. Consider a large class of distributed applications, which is targeted toward supporting user or application access to databases
* *Commonly advocated architecture*. A system with three logical levels
    * The application-interface level, i.e. handle interaction with a user or some external application
    * The processing level, i.e. generally contain the core functionality of the application
    * The data level, i.e. operate on database or file system
* *Example*. A simplified organization of an Internet search engine

        <figcaption>The simplified organization of an Internet search engine</figcaption>
    </div>

## Object-based and service-oriented architectures
**Object-based architectures**. Each object corresponds to a component, and these components are connected through a procedure call mechanism

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gyRWoZN.png">
    <figcaption>An object-based architectural style</figcaption>
</div>

* *Attractivity of object-based architectures*. They provide a natural way of encapsulating data, i.e. object's state, and the operations which can be performed on that data, i.e. object's methods, into a single entity
* *Object interface*. Conceal implementation details

    $\to$ We can, in principle, consider an object completely independent of its environment
    * *Interface and object replaceability*. If the interface is clearly defined and left otherwise untouched

        $\to$ An object should be replaceable with one having exactly the same interface
    * *Distributed object*. We can place an interface at one machine, while the object resides on another machine

**Distributed object**. When a client binds to a distributed object, an implementation of the object's interface, called a proxy, is loaded into the client's address space

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Xv7zttM.png">
    <figcaption>Common organization of a remote object with client-side proxy</figcaption>
</div>

* *Proxy*, Analogous to a client stub in RPC systems
    * *Functionality*. 
        * Marshal method invocations into messages
        * Unmarshal reply messages to return the result of the method invocation to the client
* *Actual object*. Reside at a server machine, where it offers the same interface as it does on the client machine
    * *Processing invocation requets*. Invocation requests aree passed to a server stub
        
        $\to$ The server stub unmarshals them to make method invocations at the object's interface at the server
    * *Other functionality of server stub*. Marshal replies and forward reply messages to the client-side proxy
* *Skeleton*. The server-side stub is often referred to as a skeleton, as it provides the bare means for letting the server middleware access the user-defined objects
    * *Implementation*. In practice, the skeleton often contains incomplete code, in the form of a language-specific class, which needs to be further specialized by the developer
* *Remote objects*. Most distributed objects have their state not distributed, i.e. it resides at a single machine
    
    $\to$ Only the interfaces implemented by the object are made available on other machines
    * *Distributed object state*. The state of a object can be physically distributed across multiple machines, but this distribution is hidden from clients behind the object's interfaces

**Encapsulation**. Object-based architectures form the foundation of encapsulating services into independent units
* *Encapsulation*. The service as a whole is realized as a self-contained entity, although it can make use of other services

    $\to$ By clearly separating various services such that they can operate independently, we are paving the road toward service-oriented architectures (SOAs)
* *Service-oriented architecture*. A distributed application or system is essentially constructed as a composition of many different services

    $\to$ Not all of these services may belong to the same administrative organization
    * *Example*. An organization running its business application makes use of storage services offered by a cloud provider

        $\to$ These storage services are logically completely encapsulated into a single unit, of which an interface is made available to customers
* *Consequence*. The problem of developing a distributed system is partly one of service composition, and making sure that those services operate in harmony
    * *Crucial problem*. Each service should offer a well-defined programming interface

        $\to$ Each service offers its own interface, in turn, possibly making the composition of services far from trivial

## Resource-based architectures
**Problems with service composition**. Connecting various components can easily turn into an integration nightmare
* *Alternative option*. View a distributed system as a huge collection of  resources, which are individually managed by components
    
    $\to$ Resources may be added, or removed by remote applications, and can be retrieved or modified

**Representational state transfer (REST)**. A widely adopted approach for the Web
* *RESTful architectures*.
    * Resources are identified through a single naming scheme
    * All services offer the same interface, consisting of at most four operations

        | Operation | Description |
        | --- | --- |
        | PUT | Create a new resource |
        | GET | Retrieve the state of a resource in some representation |
        | DELETE | Delete a resource |
        | POST | Modify a resource by transferring a new state |
    
    * Messages sent to or from a service are fully self-described
    * After executing an operation at a service, that componet forgets everything about the caller, i.e. stateless execution
* *Example*. Consdier Amazon's Single Storage Service (Amazon S3)
    * *Supported resources*. 
        * Objects, which are essentially the equivalent of files
        * Buckets, which are essentially the equivalent of directories
            * *Nested buckets*. There is no concept of placing buckets into buckets
    * *Object URL*. An object named `ObjectName` contained in bucket `BucketName` is referred as by the URL `http://BucketName.s3.amazonaws.com/ObjectName`
    * *Bucket and object creation*. An application would essentially send a PUT request with the URI of the bucket / object

        $\to$ If the bucket or object already exists, an HTTP error message is returned
        * *Communication protocol*. HTTP
    * *Bucket listing*. To know which objects are contained in a bucket, an application would send a GET request with the URI of that bucket

        $\to$ S3 will return a list of object names, as an ordinary HTTP response
* *Popularity of RESTful architecture*. Due to its simplicity, RESTful architecture has become popular
* *RESTful versus services using service-specific interfaces*.
    * The simplicity of RESTful architectures can easily prohibit easy solutions to intricate communication schemes
        * *Example*. When the service needs to keep track of the execution state
    * There are many examples, in which RESTful architectures perfectly match a simple integration scheme of services

## Publish-subscribe architectures
**Problem**. As systems continue to grow and processes can more easily join or leave

$\to$ It is important to have an architecture, in which dependencies between processes are as loose as possible
* *Solution*. A large class of distributed systems have adopted an architecture, in which there is a strong separation between processing and coordination
    * *Idea*. View a system as a collection of autonomously operating processes
    * *Coordination*. Encompass the communication and cooperation between processes

        $\to$ It forms the glue binding the activities performed by processes into a whole

**Coordination models (by Cabri et. al.)**.

| | Temporally coupled | Temporally decoupled |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Referentially coupled** | Direct | Mailbox |
| **Referentially decoupled** | Event-based | Shared data space |

* *Direct coordination*. When processes are temporally and referentially coupled

    $\to$ Coordination takes place in a direct way, i.e. direct coordination
    * *Referential coupling*. Generally appera in the form of explicit referencing in communication
        * *Example*. A process can communicate only if it knows the name or ID of the other process it wants to exchange information with
    * *Temporal coupling*. Communicating processes will both have to be up and running
* *Mailbox coordination*. There is no need for two communicating processes to be executing at the same time, in order to let communication to take place
* *Event-based coordination*. Processes do not know each other explicitly
    * *Publishing*. The only thing a process can do is publish a notification describing the occurrence of an event, e.g. that it wants to coordinate activities, or it just produced some interesting results
    * *Subscribe*. Notifications can come in all sorts and kinds, and processes may subscribe to a specific kind of notification
    * *Ideal event-based coordination model*. A published notification will be delivered exactly to those processes which have subscribed to it

        >**NOTE**. It is generally required that the subscriber is up-and-running at the time the notification was published
* *Shared data space*. A well-known coordination model, which is the combination of referentially and temporally decoupled processes
    * *Key idea*. Processes communicate entirely through tuples, i.e. structured data records consisting of a number of fields, very similar to a row in a database table

        $\to$ Process can put any type of tuple into the shared data space
    * *Tuple retrieval*. TO retrieve a tuple, a process provides a search pattern, which is matched against the tuples

        $\to$ Any matched tuple is returned
    * *Associative search mechanism*. When a process wants to extract a tuple from the data space
        1. It specifies some of the values of the fields it is interested in
        2. Any tuple matching that specification is then removed from the data space, and passed to the process
    * *Combination with event-based coordination*. Shared data base are often combined with event-based coordination
        * *Explain*. A process subscribes to certain tuples by providing a search pattern

            $\to$ When a process inserts a tuple into the data space, matching subscribers are notified
        * *Publish-subscribe architecture*. In both cases, i.e. event-based coordination and combination of shared data space and event-based coordination, we are dealing with publish-subscribe architecture

            $\to$ The key characteristic feature is the processes have no explicit reference to each other
        * *Difference between a pure event-based coordination and a shared data space*.

            </div>

**Communication in publish-subscribe systems**. Take place by describing the events, which a subscriber is interested in

$\to$ Naming plays a cruicial role
* *Event description*. Events are described by a series of attributes
* *Publishing and subscribing a notification*.
    * *Publishing*. A notification describing an event is said to be published when it is made available for other processes to read
    * *Subscribing*. A subscription needs to be passed to the middleware, containing a description of the event, which the subscriber is interested in
        * *Topic-based publish-subscribe systems*. Such description typically consists of some (attribute, value) pairs
        * *Content-based publish-subscribe systems*. A subscription may also consist of (attribute, range) pairs

            $\to$ The specified attribute is expected to take on values within a specified range
        
    >**NOTE**. The more complex a description is, the more difficult it will be to test whether an event matches a description

**Subscription-notification matching**. 

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/wiLCvMx.png">
    <figcaption>The principle of exchanging data items between publishers and subscribers</figcaption>
</div>

* *Successful matching scenarios*. In many cases, an event actually corresponds to data becoming available

    $\to$ When matching succeeds, there are two possible scenarios
* *Case 1*. The middleware may decide to forward the published notification, along with the associated data, to its current set of subscribers
    * *Data storage*. In this case, the middleware will generally not offer storage of data

        $\to$ Storage is either explicitly handled by a separate service, or is the responsibility of the subscribers, i.e. referentially decoupled but temporally coupled system
* *Case 2*. The middleware can also forward only a notification, at which point subscribers can execute a `read` operation to retrieve the associated data item
    * *Data storage*. The middleware has to store data items, thus there are additional operations for data management
        * *Data item expiration*. It is possible to attach a lease to a data item, such that when the lease expires

            $\to$ The data item is automatically deleted

**Complexity of processing subscriptions**. Events can easily complicate the processing of subscriptions
* *Scenario*. Consider a subscription such as "notify when room ZI.1060 is unoccupied and the door is unlocked"

    $\to$ A system supporting such subscriptions can be implemented by placing independent sensors for monitoring room occupancy, and those for registering the status of a door lock
    * *Consequence*. We need to compose such primitive events into a publishable data item, to which processes can then subscribe

        $\to$ Event composition is a difficult task, notable when the primitive events are generated from sources dispersed across the distributed system

**Key issue in publish-subscribe systems**. Implement an efficient and scalable mechanism for matching subscriptions to notifications

# Appendix
## Concepts
**On interfaces (advanced)**. A service cannot be made easier or more difficult just due to the particular interface it offers

$\to$ A service offers functionality, and at the best way, which the service is accessed, is determined by the interface
* *Transparency between RESTful and service-specific interfaces*. Consider REST interface and traditional interface of Amazon S3 service, i.e. SOAP
    * *SOAP interface*. Consist of approximately 16 operations, or 50 operations if we access Amazon S3 using the Python `boto` library
    * *REST interface*. Offer only very few operations as given previously
    * *Explain*. These differences come from the parameter space, i.e.
        * In RESTful architectures, an application needs to provide all it wants through the parameters it passes by one of the operations
            * *Example*. To create a bucket `mybucket`, the command is

                ```bash
                PUT "http://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/"
                ```

            * *Pros*. Changes are much easier to accommodate, as they would generally involve changing the layout of strings encoding what is actually required

        * In Amazon's SOAP interface, the number of parameters per operation is generally limited
            * *Example*. To create a bucket `mybucket`, the command is

                ```python
                import bucket
                bucket.create("mybucket")
                ```
            
            * *Pros*. Specifying the semantics of an operation is much easier with specific interfaces than with ones offering only generic operations
