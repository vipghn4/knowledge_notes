# System architecture
**System architecture**. Deciding on software components, their interaction, and their placement

## Centralized organizations
**Motivation**. Thinking in terms of clients requesting services from servers helps understanding and managing the complexity of distributed systems

### Simple client-server architecture
**Request-reply behavior**. The basic client-server model
* *Client and server*. Processes in a distributed system are divided into two groups
    * *Server*. A process implementing a specific service
    * *Client*. A process requesting a service from a server by sending it a request and subsequently waiting for reply
* *Client-server communication*. Implemented by means of a simple connectionless protocol when the underlying network is fairly reliable as in many local-area networks
    * *Client process*. When a client requests a service
        1. It packages a message for the server, identifying the service it wants and the necessary input data
        2. The message is then sent to the server
    * *Server process*. The server wait for an incoming request, subsequently process it

        $\to$ Then package the results in a reply message, which is sent to the client
* *Pros and cons*.
    * *Pros*. Efficient, i.e. if messages are not lost or corrupted

        $\to$ The request-reply protocol just sketched works fine
    * *Cons*. Making the protocol resistant to occasional transmission failures is not trivial

        $\to$ The only thing we can do is possibly let the client resend the request when no reply message comes in
        * *Problem*. The client cannot detect whether the original request message was lost, or that transmission of the reply failed
            
            $\to$ If the reply was lost, then resending a request may result in performing the operation twice

**Reliable connection-oriented protocols**. Manyu client-server systems use a reliable connection-oriented protocol
* *Usage*. 
    * This solution is not entirely appropriate in a LAN due to relatively slow performance
    * This solution works perfectly fine in WAN, in which communication is inherently unreliable

**One of the main issues of client-server architecture**. How to draw a clear distinction between a client and a server

$\to$ There is often no clear distinction

### Multitiered architectures
**Simplest organization of client-server application**. Based on the application layering of three logical levels, i.e. UI, processing, and data levels
* *Idea*. There are only two types of machines
    * *Client machine*. Contain only the programs implementing part of the UI level
    * *Server machine*. Contain the rest, i.e. the programs implementing the processing and data levels
* *Workload of client and server*. Everything is handled by the server, while the client is essentially no more than a dumb terminal, possibly with only a convenient interface

**Two-tiered architecture (physically)**. This approach makes a distinction between only two kinds of machines, i.e. client machines and server machines

    <figcaption>Client-server organizations in a two-tiered architecture</figcaption>
</div>

* *Options*.
    * *Option 1 (figure a)*. Have only terminal-dependent part of the UI on the client machine, and give the applications remote control over the presentation of their data
    * *Option 2 (figure b)*. Place the entire UI software on the client side

        $\to$ The front-end does no processing other than necessary for presenting the application's interface
    * *Option 3 (figure c)*. Move part of the application to the front end
        * *Usage*. 
            * When the application uses a form, which needs to be filled in, before it can be processed

                $\to$ The front-end can check the correctness and consistency of the form, and where necessary interact with the user
            * A word processor, in which basic editing functions execute on the client side, where they operate on locally cached, or in-memory data

                $\to$ Spell check and grammar check execute on the server side
    * *Option 4 (figure d and e)*. Particularly popular in many client-server environments
        * *Usage*. When the client machine is a PC or workstation, connected through a network to distributed file system or database

            $\to$ Most of the application is running on the client machine, but all operations on files or database entries go to the server
* *Generalization*. Organize clients and servers by distributing the three layers across different machines

**Choosing the best two-tiered architecture**. There has been a strong trend to move away from the configurations in figure d and e

$\to$ Instead, most of the processing and data storage is handled at the server side
* *Reasoning*. Although client machines do a lot, they are also more problematic to manage, i.e.
    * Having more functionality on the client machine means that a wide range of end users will need to be able to handle the software
        
        $\to$ More effort needs to be spent on making software resilient to end-user behavior
    * Client-side software is dependent on the client's underlying playform, e.g. OS and resources

        $\to$ This can easily mean that multiple versions will need to be maintained
    * From a system-management perspective, having "fat clients" is not optimal

        $\to$ "Thin clients" as given in figure a, b, and c, are much easier
* *Fat-client organization usage*. There are many applications, for which a fat-client organization is often still the best
    * *Example*. 
        * Office suits, and multimedia applications requiring that processing is done on the client's side
        * With the advent of advanced Web browsing technology
            
            $\to$ It is much easier now to dynamically place and manage client-side software by simply uploading scripts
        * The type of client-side software management by script uploading runs in well-defined commonly deployed environments

            $\to$ Platform dependency is much less of an issue
* *Moving away from fat client and the need for distributed systems*. Moving away from fat clients does not imply that we no longer need distributed systems
    * *Explain*. The server-side solutions are becoming increasingly more distributed as a single server is being replaced by multiple servers running on different machines
    * *Example*. Cloud computing

**Three-tiered architecture (physically)**.

<div style="text-align:center">

    <figcaption>An example of a server acting as client</figcaption>
</div>

* *Idea*. Traditionally programs forming part of the processing layer are executed by a separate server, and may additionally be partly distributed across the client and server machines
    * *Example*. Transaction processing, i.e. a separate processed, i.e. the transaction processing monitor, coordinates all transactions across possibly different data servers

## Decentralized organizations - P2P systems
**Vertical distribution and horizontal distribution**.
* *Vertical distribution*. In many business environments, distributed processing is equivalent to organizing a client-server application as multitiered architecture
    * *Characteristic feature*. Vertical distribution is achieved by placing locally different components on different machines
    * *"Vertical" meaning*. This term is related to the concept of "vertical fragmentation" as used in a distributed relational database

        $\to$ This means that tables are splitted columnwise, and subsequently distributed across multiple machines
* *Benefits from a system-management perspective*. Functions are logically and physically split across multiple machines
    
    $\to$ Each machine is tailored to a specific group of functions

**Horizontal distribution**. A client or server may be physically split into logically equivalent parts

$\to$ Each part is operating on its own share of the complete dataset, thus balancing the load
* *Example*. P2P systems

**P2P systems**. From a high-level perspective, the processes constituiting a P2P system are all equal
* *Explain*. Functions needing to be carried out are represented by every process constituting the distributed system
    * *Consequence*. Much of the interaction between process is symmetric, i.e. each process will act as a client and a server at the same time

        $\to$ This is referred as acting as a servant
* *Overlay network*. P2P architectures, given their symmetric behavior, evolve around the question how to organize the processes in an overlay network
    * *Overlay network*. A network, in which the nodes are formed by the processes and the links represent the possible communication channels
        * *Node communication*. A node may not be able to communicate directly with an arbitrary other node

            $\to$ It is required to send messages through the available communication channels
    * *Types of overlay networks*. Those which are structured, and those which are not

### Structured P2P systems
**Structured P2P systems**. In a structured P2P system, the nodes, i.e. processes, are organized in an overlay which adheres to a specific, deterministic topology, e.g. a ring, a binary tree, a grid, etc.
* *Purpose of topology*. Used to efficiently look up data
* *Semantic-free index*. Characteristic for structured P2P systems, is that they are generally based on using a semantic-free index
    * *Semantic-free index*. Each data item, which is to be maintained by the system, is uniquely associated with a key

        $\to$ This key is subsequently used as an index
    * *Key format*. Commonly a hash function, i.e.

        $$\text{key}(\text{data item}) = \text{hash}(\text{data item's value})$$
    * *Consequence*. The P2P system, as a whole, is now responsible for storing (key, value) pairs, i.e.
        * Each node is assigned an ID from the same set of all possible hash values
        * Each node is made responsible for storing data associated with a specific subset of keys
* *Distributed hash table (DHT)*. In essence, the system is thus seen to implement a DHT

**Looking up a data item by means of its key**. The system provides an efficient implementation of a function `lookup` mapping a key to an existing node, i.e.

$$\text{existing node} = \text{lookup}(key)$$

$\to$ This is where the topology of a structured P2P system plays a crucial role
* *Explain*. Any node can be asked to look up a given key, which boils down to efficiently routing that lookup request to the node responsible for storing the data associated with the given key

**Example - Hypercube organization of a P2P distributed system**. A naive P2P system
* *Hypercube*. A $n$-dimensional cube
* *System organization*. Each data item is associated with one of the nodes
    * *Data item association*. Hash the value of a data item to a key $k\in\{0,\dots,2^n-1\}$
        
        $\to$ The item's key is then converted to binary form, then the node, whose coordinate fits the binary form, will store the data item
        * *Example*. $7$ is converted to binary form as $0111$, i.e. in case of $n=4$, thus the node with coordinate $(0,1,1,1)$ would store the data item
    * *Data item lookup*. If a node with identifier $i$ is requested to look up the data having key $j$

        $\to$ This node will forward the request to a neighbor, which is closer to node $j$

### Unstructured P2P systems
**Unstructured P2P systems**. Each node maintains an ad hoc list of neighbors, the resulting overlay resembles a random graph
* *Random graph*. A graph, in which an edge $\langle u,v \rangle$ between two nodes $u$ and $v$ exists only with a certain probability $P[\langle u, v\rangle]$
    
    >**NOTE**. Ideally, $P[\langle u, v\rangle]$ is the same for all pairs $(u,v)$, but in practice, a wide range of distributions is observed

* *Node joining*. When a node joins the system, it often contacts a well-known node to obtain a starting list of other peers in the system

    $\to$ This list can be used to find more peers, and perhaps ignore others, etc.

    >**NOTE**. In practice, a node generally changes its local list almost continuously

* *Data lookup*. We need to resort to searching for data, rather than following a predetermined route when lists of neighbors are constructed in a structured P2P system
    * *Flooding*. 
        * *Idea*. An issuing node $u$ is simply passes a request for a data item to all its neighbors
            * A request will be ignored when its receiving node, e.g. $v$, had seen it before
            * Otherwise, $v$ searches locally for the requested data item
                * If $v$ has the required data, it can respond directly to $u$, or send it back to the original forwarder
                    
                    $\to$ The forwarder will return the data to its original forwarder then
                * If $v$ does not have the requested data, it forwards the request to all of its own neighbors
        * *Drawback*. Very expensive
            * *TTL*. Associate time-to-live (TTL) to the request, giving the maximum number of hops a request is allowed to be forwarded
                * *Small TTL*. The erquest may not reach the desired node
                * *Large TTL*. The communication costs may be too high
            * *Adaptive TTL*. A node starts a search with an initiall TTL value of 1, then the TTL is increased if no or not enough results are returned
    * *Random walks*. 
        * *Idea*. An issuing node $u$ can try to find a data item by asking a randomly chosen neighbor $v$
            
            $\to$ If $v$ does not have the data, it forwards the request to the one of its randomly chosen neighbors
        * *Pros and cons*.
            * *Pros*. Much less network traffic
            * *Cons*. Take much longer before a node is reached that has the requested data
        * *Simultaneous random walks*. Start $n$ random walks simultaneously
            * *Performance*. Studies show that, in this case, the time required to reach a node having the data drops approximately by a factor of $n$
            * *Typical value of $n$*. 16 or 64 is effective
        * *Stopping random walks*. We can use a TLL, or when a node receives a lookup request, check with the issuer whether forwarding the request to another randomly selected neighbor is still required
    * *Policy-based seach methods*. Lie between flooding and random walks
        * *Idea*. A node may decide to keep track of peers who responded positively, effectively turning them into preferred neighbors for succeeding queries

            $\to$ We may want to restrict flooding to fewer neighbors, but in any case, give preference to neighbors having many neighbors themselves
* *Comarpsion techniques*. Neither flooding nor random walk relies on a specific comparison technique to decide when requested data has been found

    $\to$ For structured P2P systems, we assumed the use of keys for comparison

**Flooding versus random walks**.

### Hierarchically organized P2P networks
**Problem of unstructured P2P systems**. Locating relevant data items can become problematic as the network grows
* *Explain*. There is deterministic way of routing a lookup request to a specific data item
    
    $\to$ Eseentially the only technique a node can resort to is searching for the request by means of flooding or randomly walking through the network
* *Solution*. Make use of special nodes maintaining an index of data items

**Breaking the symmetric nature of P2P systems**. There are situations, in which abandoning the symmetric nature of P2P systems is sensible

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/LmUjliJ.png">
    <figcaption>A hierarchical organization of nodes into a super-peer network</figcaption>
</div>

* *Collaborative content delivery network (CDN) - An example*. Nodes may offer storage for hosting copies of Web documents, allowing Web clients to access pages nearby, thus to access them quickly

    $\to$ We need a means to find out where documents can be stored best
    * *Broker*. A broker can be used to collect data on resource usage and availability for a number of nodes, which are in each other's proximity

        $\to$ This allows to quickly select a node with sufficient resources

**Weak peers and super peers**.
* *Super peers*. Nodes maintaining an index, or acting as a broker
    * *Organization of super peers*. Super peers are often organized in a P2P network, leading to a hierarchical oragnization
* *Weak peer*. Every weak peer is connected, as a client, to a super peer

    $\to$ All communication from and to weak peer proceeds through that peer's associated super peer
* *Super-weak peer association*.
    * *Fixed association*. Whenever weak peer joins the network, it attaches to one of the super peers, and remains attached until it leaves the network

        $\to$ Super peers are expected to be long-lived processes with high availability

        >**NOTE**. To compensate for potential unstable behavior of a super peer, backup schemes can be deployed, e.g. pairing every super peer with another one and requiring weak peers to attach both
    
        * *Cases not to use*. In case of file-sharing networks, in may be better for a weak peer to attach to a super peer, which maintains an index of requested files

            $\to$ Chances are bigger that when a weak peer is looking for a specific file, its super peer will know where to find it
    * *Dynamic association*. Association between weak peer and strong peer can change, as weak peers discover better super peers to associate with
        * *Idea*. A super peer returning the result of a lookup operation is given preference over other super peers

**Problem of super-peer networks**. How to select the nodes, which are eligible to become super peer

$\to$ This is closely related to the leader-election problem

**Skype network - An example**. Consider the Skype VoIP network, which is organized very similar to a hierarchical P2P network with several differences
* *Skype login server*. A centralized server, to which every peer can communicate, i.e. weak as well as super peers
* *Skyper super nodes*. Super peers. i.e crucial to the working of the system as a whole

    $\to$ Besides the login server, there are a number of default Skype super peers, which can be used to get started when a weak peer starts from scratch
    * *Address of Skype super peers*. Hard-coded in the Skype software, and consist of an (IP address, port number) pair
* *Weak peer*. Each weak peer has a local list of addresses of reachable super peers, i.e. called its host cache
    
    $\to$ If none of the cached super peers is reachable, it tries to connect to one of the default super peers
    * *Host cache design*. The host cache is designed to accommodate a few hundred addresses
    * *Connecting to the Skype network*. A weak peer is required to establish a TCP connection with a super peer

        $\to$ This is important, notably when a peer is operating behind a NATed firewall, as the super peer can assist in actually contacting that peer
* *Weak peer communication*. Consider the case where one peer A wants to contact another weak peer B, for which it (A) has a contact address

    >**NOTE**. These cases related to the situation whether or not peers are behind NATed firewalls

    * *Case 1 - Both A and B are on the public Internet*. A and B can be directly contacted

        $\to$ A TCP connection is set up between A and B, which is used to exchange control packets
        * *Actual call*. Take place using UDP packets between negotiated ports at the caller and callee, respectively
    * *Case 2 - A operates behind a firewall, while B is on the public Internet*. A will set up a TCP connection to a super peer S, after which S will set up a TCP connection to B

        $\to$ TCP connections are used to transfer control packets between A and B, via S

        >**NOTE**. In this case, we assume that the firewall does not restrict UDP traffic

        * *Actual call*. Take place using UDP and directly between A and B, without flowing through S
        * *Problem*. S is required to discover the correct pair of port numbers for the firewall at A to allow for UDP packet exchanges

            $\to$ In principle, this should be possible with assistance of B
    * *Case 3 - Both A and B operate behind a firewall*. This is difficult, especially if we assume that the firewalls restrict UDP traffic
        * *Idea*. A connects to an online super peer S via TCP, after which S will set up a TCP connection to B

            $\to$ These connections are used for exchanging control packets
        * *Actual call*. Another super peer is contacted, that will act as a relay R, i.e. A sets up a connection to B, and so will B

            $\to$ All voice traffic is then subsequently forwarded over the two TCP connections, and via R

>**NOTE**. How Skype works is similar to how Teamviewer works

## Hybrid architectures
**Hybrid architectures**. Many distributed systems combine architectural features

### Edge-server systems
**Edge-server systems**. These systems are deployed on the Internet, where servers are placed at the edge of the network

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MtZl2KS.png">
    <figcaption>Viewing the Internet as a collection of edge users</figcaption>
</div>

* *Network edge*. Formed by the boundary between enterprise networks and the actual Internet, e.g. as provided by an ISP
    * *Example*. End users at home connect to the Internet, via their ISP
        
        $\to$ The ISP can be considered as residing at the edge of the Internet
* *Edge servers*. End users, or clients in general, connect to the Internet by means of an edge server
    * *Main purpose*. To serve content, possibly after applying filtering and transcoding functions

        >**NOTE**. A collection of edge servers can be used to optimize content and application distribution
    
    * *Basic model*. For a specific organization, one edge server acts as an origin server, from which all content originates

        $\to$ That server can use other edge servers for replicating Wewb pages and suchs

### Collaborative distributed systems
**Collaborative distributed systems**. The main issue in many of these systmes is to first get started, for whcih often a traditional client-server scheme is deployed

$\to$ Once a node has joined the system, it can use a fully decentralized scheme for collaboration

**BitTorrent file sharing system - An example**. A P2P file downloading system

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/X8ctCyL.png">
    <figcaption>THe principal working of BitTorrent</figcaption>
</div>

* *Basic idea*. When an end user is looking for a file, he downloads chunks of the file from other users until the downloaded chunks can be assembled together, yielding the complete file

    $\to$ An important design goal is to ensure collaboration
* *Free riding problem in most file-sharing system*. A significant fraction of participants merely download files but contribute close to nothing

    $\to$ To prevent this, in BitTorrent, a file can be downloaded only when the downloading client is providing content to someone else
* *Downloading a file*. 
    1. To download a file, a user needs to access a global directory, which is generally just aone of a few well-known Web sites

        $\to$ A directory contains references to torrent files
        * *Torrent file*. Contain information required to download a specific file, i.e. link to a tracker
        * *Tracker*. A server keeping an accurate account of active nodes, which have chunks of the requested file
        * *Active node*. A node which is currently downloading the file as well
    2. Once the nodes have been identified, from where chunks can be downloaded, the downloading node effectively becomes active

        $\to$ It will be forced to help others, e.g. provide chunks of the file it is downloading that others do not have yet
        * *Enforcement mechanism*. If node P notices that node Q is downloading more than it is uploading

            $\to$ P can decide to decrease the rate, at which it sends data to Q, if P has something to download from Q
        * *Consequence*. Nodes are often supplied with references to many other nodes putting them in a better position to trade data
* *Bottleneck in BitTorrent*. Come from the trackers
    * *Alternative implementation*. A node also joins a separate structured P2P system, i.e. a DHT, to assist in tracking file downloads

        $\to$ The central tracker's load is now distributed across the participating nodes, with each node acting as a tracker for relatively small set of torrent files

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Idempotent operations**. An operation which can be repeated multiple times without 

**NAT firewall**.
* *Firewall and NAT*.
    * *Network address translation (NAT)*. A method of mapping an IP address space to another by modifying the network address information in the IP header of packets, while they are in transit across a traffic routing service
        * *Motivation*. Originally used to avoid the need to assign a new address to every host when a network was moved, or when upstream ISP was replaced

            $\to$ It has become a popular and essential tool in conserving global address space in the face of IPv4 address exhaustion
    * *Firewall*. A network security system monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic, based on predetermined security rules
        * *"Firewall" meaning*. Originally refer to a wall intended to confine a fire within a line of adjacent buildings
* *NAT firewall*. Operate on a router to protect private networks
    * *Idea*. Only allow Internet traffic to pass through if a device on the private network requested it

        $\to$ A NAT firewall protects the identity of a network, and does not show internal IP addresses to the Internet
        * *Explain*. 
            * When connected to the Internet, our router is assigned a single public IP address, which is visible to the wider net, and is required to communicate with Web servers

                $\to$ Any devices connected to the router locally have private IP addresses, which do not allow them to directly communicate with the required Web server
            * This is where NAT comes into play, i.e. it directs traffic back and forth
    * *How NAT firewalls work*.
        1. Our device sends a request to a Web server by sending data packets, including information like sender and receiver's IP addresses, port numbers, and what information is requested
        2. The traffic goes through a router with a NAT firewall, then NAT changes the data packet's private IP to the router's public IP

            $\to$ The router notes this change and adds to its NAT forwarding table
        3. Data packets reach the Web server and get necessary information
        4. The information travels back to the router, and NAT's job is to send the information back to the device requesting it

            $\to$ The NAT uses its forwarding table to determine who requested this data
        5. NAT changes the data packet's public IP to its previous private IP, and sends it to the requested device
    * *How NAT protect us*. The NAT works as hardware firewall solution, even though it is not a security tool by design
        * *Benefits of NAT*.
            * It hides the IP addresses of any devices on the private network from the outside world, giving them all a single address
            * It requires every incoming packet of information to have been asked by a device

                $\to$ If a malicious data packet is not on the list of expected communication, it gets rejected
            * Some firewalls can use whitelisting to block unauthorized outgoing traffic

                $\to$ If we contract a piece of malware, our firewall may prevent it from communicating with our device
        * *Importance of NAT*. Despite of the existence of more sophisticated attacks, it does not mean we should not use NAT

            $\to$ Without NAT, it would be simple for any amateur hacker to access our computer, simply by learning our IP addresses
