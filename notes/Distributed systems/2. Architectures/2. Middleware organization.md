# Middleware organization
**Important types of design aptterns applied to the organization of middleware**. Wrappers and interceptors
* *Goal*. Achieve openness

## Wrappers
**Fundamental problem of building a distributed system out of existing components**. The interfaces offered by the legacy component are most likely not suitable for all applications
* *Wrapper (or adapter)*. A special component offering an interface acceptable to a client application
    * *Idea*. Functions of the interface are transformed into those available at the components

        $\to$ In essence, wrapper solves the problem of incompatible interfaces
    * *Wrapper in distributed system*. An object adapter is a component allowing applications to invoke remote objects
        
        $\to$ Although those objects may have been implemented as a combination of library functions operating on the tables of a relational database
* *Example*. 
    * *Amazon's S3 storage service*. In RESTful interface Clients will be using HTTP protocol, essentially communicating with a traditional Web server

        $\to$ The Web server acts as an adapter to the actual storage service, by partly dissecting incoming requests and handing them off to specialized servers internal to S3
* *Role of wrappers*. Extensibility, which is crucial for achieving openness, used to be addressed by adding wrappers as needed
    * *Example*. If application A managed data required by application B

        $\to$ We can develop a wrapper specific for B, so that it could have access to A's data
        * *Drawback*. This idea does not scale, i.e. with $N$ applications, we need to develop $N\times (N-1) \in O(N^2)$ wrappers

**Middleware**. Facilitating a reduction of the number of wrappers is typically done through middleware
* *Option 1*. Implement a broker, which is logically a centralized component handling all the accesses between different applications

        <figcaption>Naive wrapper (a) and wrapper with broker (b)</figcaption>
    </div>

    * *Example*. Message broker, i.e. 
        1. Applications simply send requests to the broker containing information on what they need
        2. The broker, having knowledge of all relevant applications, contacts the appropriate applications, possibly combines and transforms the responses
        3. The brokeer then returns the result to the initial application
    * *Number of wrappers*. At most $2N in O(N)$ instead of $O(N^2)$, since a broker offers a single interface to each application

        $\to$ With $N$ applications, for each one, we need a wrapper for reading from broker and a wrapper for writing to broker

## Interceptors
**Interceptor**. A software construct which w ill break the usual flow of control and allow other application-specific code to be executed
* *Usage*. Primary means for adpating middleware to the specific needs of an application

    $\to$ They play an important role in making middleware open
* *Drawbacks*. 
    * To make interceptors generic may require a substantial implementation effort
    * It is unclear whether in such cases, generality should be preferred over restricted applicability and simplicity
    * In many cases, having only limited interception facilities will improve management of the software and the distributed system as a whole

**Basic idea of interception in many object-based distributed systems**. An object A can call a method belonging to an object B, while B resides on a different machine than A

</div>

* *Procedure*.
    1. Object A is offered a local interface, which is exactly the same as the interface offered by B

        $\to$ A calls the method available in the interface
    2. The call by A is transformed into a generic object invocation, i.e. interception step
        
        $\to$ This is made possible through a general object-invocation interface offered by the middleware at the machine of A
    3. Finally, the generic object invocation is transformed into a message, i.e. interception step 
    4. The message is sent through the transport-level network interface as offered by A's local OS
* *Request-level interceptor (preprocessing of object middleware)*. Call `invoke(B, &doit, val)` for each of the replicas
    * *Benefits*. 
        * The object A need not be aware of the replication of B
        * The object middleware need not have special components dealing with replicated calls
    * *Explain*. Only the request-level interceptor, which may be added to the middleware, needs to know about B's replication
* *Message-level interceptor (postprocessing of object middleware)*. A call to a remote object, in this step, will have to be sent over the network

    $\to$ The messaging interface offered by the local OS will need to be invoked
    * *Message-level interceptor*. Assist in transferring the invocation to the target object
        * *Example*. Fragment a huge array of data into smaller parts, before transmission, to have it assembled again at the destination

            $\to$ Such fragmentation improves performance or reliability
        * *Benefits*. The middleware need not be aware of processing steps within message-level interceptor

            $\to$ The interceptor will transparently handle the rest of the communication with the local OS

## Modifiable middleware
**Adaptation in distributed systems**. The need for adaptation comes from the fact that the environment, in which distributed applications are executed, changes continuously

$\to$ What wrappers and interceptors offer are means to extend and adapt the middleware
* *Consequence*. Rather than making applications responsible for reacting to changes

    $\to$ This task is placed in the middleware
* *Scaling a distributed system*. As the size of a distributed system increases, changing its parts can rarely be done by temporarily shutting it down

    $\to$ What is needed is being able to make changes on-the-fly

**Adaptive software**. The strong influences from the environment have brought many designers of middleware to consider the construction of adaptive software
* *Modifiable middleware*. Middleware may not only need to be adaptive, but we should be able to purposefully modify it without bringing it down

    $\to$ In this context, interceptors can offer a means to adapt the standard flow of control
* *One of the most popular approaches for modifiable middlware*. Dynamically constructing middleware from components

**Component-based design**. Focus on supporting modifiability through composition
* *Explain*. A system may be configured statically at design time, or dynamically at runtime

    $\to$ For dynamic configuration at runtime, late binding must be supported
* *Late binding*. A technique applied successfully in programming language environments, and for OSes, where modules can be loaded and unloaded at will
* *Problem*. How to automatically select the best implementation of a component during runtime

    $\to$ This problem remains complex for distributed systems, especially when considering that replacement of a component requires to know exactly what the effect of that replacement on other components will be
    * *Explain*. In many cases, components are less independent as one may think
* *Adapting dynamic changes to the software making up the middleware*. To do this, we need 
    * (At least) Basic support to load and unload components at runtime
    * For each component, explicit specifications of the interface it offers, and the interfaces it requires
    * If state is maintained between calls to a component, then further special measures are required
