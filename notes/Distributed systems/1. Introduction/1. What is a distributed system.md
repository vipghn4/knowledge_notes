# What is a distributed system
**History of connecting independent computers**.
* *Multiprocessors computers*. Introduce the problems of adapting and developing programs to exploit parallelism
* *Local-area networks (LANs)*. Allow thousands of machines within a building to be connected so that small amounts of information can be transferred in a few microseconds or so

    $\to$ Large amounts of data cna be moved between machines at rates of billions of bits per second
* *Wide-area networks (WANs)*. Allow hundreds of millions of machines all over the Earth to be connected at speeds varying from tens of thousands to hundreds of millions bps
* *Plug computers*. Small computers, often the size of a power adapter, can be plugged directly into an outlet and offer near-desktop performance

**The need for a distributed system**. The results of the technologies above lead to the feasibility and ease of putting a computer system of large numbers of networked computers together

$\to$ These computers are generally geographically dispersed, for which reason they are usually said to form a distributed system
* *Number of computers*. Vary from a handful of devices to millions of computers
* *Types of networking*. Wired, wireless, or a combination of both
* *Dynamic distributed systems*. Computers can join and leave, with the topology na performance of the network almost continuously changing

**Distributed systems**. A collection of autonomous computing elements appearing to its users can a single coherent system
* *Characteristics of a distributed system*
    * A distributed system is a collection of computing elements, each being able to behave independently of each other
        * *Node*. A computing element in a distributed system
        * *Form of node*. A hardware device or a software process
    * Users believe they are dealing with a single system

        $\to$ One way or another the autonomous nodes need to collaborate

## Characteristic 1 - Collection of autonomous computing elements
**Fundamental principle**. Nodes can act independently from each other

>**NOTE**. If the nodes ignore each other, then there is no use in putting them into the same distributed system

* *Common goal of nodes*. In practice, nodes are programmed to achieve common goals, which are realized by exchanging messages with each other
    * *Idea*. A node reacts to incoming messages, which are then processed, and leading to further communication through message passing

**Synchronization and coordination of nodes**. A consequence of dealing with independent nodes, each with its own notion of time, is that we cannot assume that there is a global clock

$\to$ This leads to the question relating to synchronization and coordination within a distributed system

**Node membership and organization**. In a distributed system, we need to manage the membership and organization of nodes
* *Explain*. 
    * We need to register which nodes may or may not belong to the system
    * We need to provide each member with a list of nodes it can directly communicate with
* *Managing group membership*. Can be exceedingly difficult, if only for reasons of admission control
    * *Open group*. Any node is allowed to join the distributed system, i.e. it can send messages to any other node in the system
    * *Closed group*. Only the members of the group can communicate with each other, and a seperate mechanism is required to let a node join or leave the group
* *Difficulties in adminssion*. 
    * A mechanism is required to authenticate a node, otherwise, if not properly designed, managing authentication can easily create a scalability bottleneck
    * Each node must, in principle, check if it is indeed communicating with another group member and not with an intruder aiming to create havoc
    * If a member can easily communicate with nonmembers, if confidentiality is an issue in the communication within the distributed system

        $\to$ We may be facing trust issues

**Overlay network**. Concerning the organization of the node collection, practice shows that a distributed system is often organized as an overlay network
* *Idea*.
    * *Case 1*. A node is typically a software process equipped with a list of other processes it can directly send messages to
    * *Case 2*. A neighbor needs to be looked up first, and message passing is then done through TCP/IP or UDP channels
* *Types of overlay networks*. There are roughly two types of overlay networks
    * *Structured overlay*. Each node has a well-defined set of neighbors, with whom it can communicate
        * *Example*. The nodes are organized in a tree or logical ring
    * *Unstructured overlay*. Each node has a number of references to randomly selected other nodes
* *Connectivity of an overlay network*. In any case, an overlay network should, in principle, always be conected
    * *Explain*. Between any two nodes, there is always a communication path allowing those nodes to route messages from one to another
* *Example of overlay network*. P2P networks

## Characteristic 2 - Single coherent system
**Key principle**. A distributed system should appear as a single coherent system
* *Extreme cases*. In some cases, researchers have even gone so far as to say that there should be a single-system view
    * *Explain*. End users should not even notice that they are dealing with processes, data, and control dispersed across a computer network
    * *Problem*. Achieving a single-system view is often asking too much
* *Coherency of a distributed system*. A distributed system is coherent if it behaves according to the expectations of its users

    $\to$ The collection of nodes, as a whole, operates the same, no matter where, when, and how interaction between a user and the system takes place

**Distribution transparency**. Offering a single coherent view is often challenging enough
* *Example challenge 1*. It requires that an end user would be able to tell exactly on which computer a process is currently executing

    >**NOTE**. Perhaps that part of a task has been spawned off to another process during executing somewhere else

* *Example challenge 2*. Where data is stored should be of no concern, and neither should it matter that the system may be replicating data to enhance perofmrance

>**NOTE**. Distribution transparency is an important design goal of distributed systems

**Trade-off for striving for a single coherent system**. Since we cannot ignore that a distributed system consists of multiple, networked nodes

$\to$ It is inevitable that at any time, only a part of the system fails
* *Consequence*. Unexpected behavior, in which, for example, some applications may continue to execute successfully, while others come to a grinding halt
* *Partial failures*. Inherent to any complex system, but in distributed systems, they are particularly difficult to hide
* *Turing-Award winner Leslie Lamport's description about a distributed system*. One in which the failure of a computer you did not know existed can render your own computer unusable

## Middleware and distributed system
**Distributed system software stack**. Distributed systems are often organized to have a separate layer of software, which is logically placed on top of the respective OSes of the computers, which are part of the system

**Middleware**. The same to a distributed system, as what an OS is to a computer

</div>

**Middleware as a resource manager**. A manager of resources offering its applications to efficiently share and deploy those resources across a network
* *Services provided for resource management*. These services can be found in most OSes, i.e.
    * Facilities for interapplication communication
    * Security services
    * Accounting services
    * Masking of and recovery from failures
* *Main difference from OSes*. Middleware services are offered in a networked environment

**Middleware as a container of commonly used components and functions**. Most services are useful to many applications

$\to$ Middleware can be viewed as a container of commonly used components and functions, which now no longer have to be implemented by applications separately
* *Typical services provided by middleware*.
    * *Communication*. A common communication service is the Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
        * *RPC service*. Allow an application to invoke a function implemented and executed on a remote computer, as if it was locally available
        * *Consequence*. A developer need merely specify the function header expressed in a special programming language
            
            $\to$ From this, the RPC subsystem can generate the necessary code, which establishes remote invocation
    * *Transactions*. Many applications make use of multiple services, which are distributed among several computers

        $\to$ Middleware generally offers special support for executing services in an all-or-nothing fashion
        * *Atmoc transaction*. The manner of executing services
        * *Consequence*. The application developer need only specify the remote services involved

            $\to$ By following a standardized protocol, the middleware makes sure that every service is invoked, or none at all
    * *Service composition*. It is increasingly common to develop new applications by taking existing programs and gluing them together
        * *Web-based middleware*. Help by standardizing the way Web services are accessed and provide the means to generate their functions in a specific order
        * *Mashups*. A simple example of how service composition is deployed
            * *Idea*. Web pages combining and aggregating data from different sources
    * *Reliability*. There has been a wealth of research on providing enhanced functions for building reliable distributed applications
        * *Example*. Any message sent by one process is guaranteed to be received by all or no other process

            $\to$ Such guarantees can greatly simplify developing distributed applications, and are typically implemented as part of the middleware
