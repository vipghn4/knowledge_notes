# Code migration
**Passing information in distributed systems**. There are situations, in which passing programs, sometimes even while they are being executed, simplifies the design of a distributed system

## Reasons for migrating code
**Process migration**. Code migration in distributed systems took place in the form of process migration, in which an entire process was moved from one node to another
* *Motivation*. Moving a running process to a different machine is a costly and intricate task, but the reason is performance
    * *Basic idea*. Overall system performance can be improved if processes are moved from heavily loaded to lightly loaded machines
    * *Load measurement*. CPU queue length, CPU utilization, and other performance indicators

    >**NOTE**. Process migration was no longer a viable option for improving distributed systems
