# Code migration
**Passing information in distributed systems**. There are situations, in which passing programs, sometimes even while they are being executed, simplifies the design of a distributed system

## Reasons for migrating code
**Process migration**. Code migration in distributed systems took place in the form of process migration, in which an entire process was moved from one node to another
* *Motivation*. Moving a running process to a different machine is a costly and intricate task, but the reason is performance
    * *Basic idea*. Overall system performance can be improved if processes are moved from heavily loaded to lightly loaded machines
    * *Load measurement*. CPU queue length, CPU utilization, and other performance indicators

    >**NOTE**. Process migration was no longer a viable option for improving distributed systems

* *Solution*. Instead of offloading machines, code is moved to make sure that a machine is sufficiently loaded
    
    >**NOTE**. Migrating complete VMs with their suite of applications to lightly loaded machines to minimize the total number of nodes being used is common in optimizing energy usage in data centers

    * *VM migration and process migration*. Although migrating VMs may require more resources, VM migration is far less intricate than migrating a process

**Load-distribution algorithms**. Concern the allocation and redistribution of tasks w.r.t a set of machines

$\to$ These algorithms play an important role in compute-intensive systems

>**NOTE**. In many modern distributed systems, optimizing computing capacity is less an issue than minimizing communication

* *Performance improvement through code migration*. Often based on qualitative reasoning, instead of mathematical models
    * *Explain*. Due to the heterogeneity of the underlying platforms and computer networks
