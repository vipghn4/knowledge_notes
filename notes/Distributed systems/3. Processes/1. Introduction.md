# Introduction
**Processes and threads in a distributed system**. 
* *Processes*. Originate from the field of OSes, where it is generally defined as a program in execution
    * *The most issues with processes in OS*. The management and scheduling of processes

        $\to$ These problems are equally or more important for distributed systems
    * *Role in distributed systems*. A basis for communication between different machines
    * *Central issue*. How processes are internally organized, and whether or not they support multiple threads of control
* *Threads*. Threads play a crucial role in obtaining performance in multicore and multiprocessor environment, and also help in structuring clients and servers
    * *Replacement by processes*. In many cases, threads are replaced by processes and OS is exploited for guaranteeing protection and facilitating communication

        $\to$ However, when performance is at stake, threads continue to play an important role
    * *Role in distributed systems*. Useful to continue using the CPU when a blocking I/O operation is performed

        $\to$ We can build a highly-efficent servers running multiple threads in parallel, of which several may be blocking to wait blocking I/O

**Virtualization**. Allow an application, and possibly also its complete environment including the OS, to run concurrently with other applications, but highly independent of the underlying hardware and platforms

$\to$ This leads to a high degree of portability, and helps in isolating failures caused by errors or security problems
* *Motivation*. Due to the advent of cloud computing, virtualization has gained tremendous attention
* *Consequence*. The flexible application of virtual machines has led to different types of services for cloud computing, e.g. infrastructures, platforms, and sfotware, all running in virtual environments

**Client-server organizations**.
* *General design issues for servers*. Object-based distributed systems, and the organization of server clusters required to collaborately provide the illusion of a single system
* *Moving processes in wide-area distributed systems*. Moving processes between different machines is an important issues
    * *Purpose*. Process migration or code migration can help in achieving scalability, and help to dynamically configure clients and servers
