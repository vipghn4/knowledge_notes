# Virtualization
**Resource virtualization**. Extended version of the illusion of parallelism, i.e. between having a single CPU and having multiple CPUs

## Principle of virtualization
**Programming interface to higher-level software**. In practice, every distributed computer system offers a programming interface to higher-level software as given in figure (a) below

</div>

* *Types of interfaces*. Ranging from the basic instruction set as offered by a CPU to a vast collection of APIs shipped with many current middleware systems
* *Virtualization*. Deal with extending or replacing an existing interface to mimic the behavior of another system, as shown in figure (b) above

    $\to$ So that the program can run as if it is working with interface A
    * *Conclusion*. We can think of virtualization as an abstract class describing the programming environment
        
        $\to$ Programs only need to care about the abstract methods and properties of this environment

### Virtualization and distributed systems
**History**. Virtualization is originally introduced to allow legacy software to run on expensive mainframe hardware

$\to$ The software not only included various applications, but also the OSes they werre developed for

**Roles of virtualization**.
* *Rapidly changing hardware and low-level systems*. While hardware and low-level systems software change reasonably fast, software at higher levels of abstraction, e.g. middleware and applications,are often much more stable

    $\to$ Legacy software cannot be maintained in the same pace as the platforms it relies on
    * *Consequence*. Virtualization can help by porting the legacy interfaces to the new platforms and immediately opening up the latter for large classes of existing programs
* *Pervasive networking*. Networking has become completely pervasive, i.e. most of modern computers are connected to a network
    * *Problems*. 
        * The system administrators must maintain a large and heterogeneous collection of server computers
            * *Heterogeneous computers*. Each computer running very different applications, which can be accessed by clients
        * The various resources should be easily accessible to the applications
    * *Consequence*. Virtualization can help a lot, i.e. the diversity of platforms and machines can be reduced by essentially letting each application run on its own virtual machine
* *Portability and flexibility*. Virtualization provides a high degree of portability and flexibility
    * *Explain*. Management becomes much easier if edge servers support virtualization, allowing a complete site, including its environment, to be dynamically copied
    
    >**NOTE**. Portability is perhaps the most important benefit of virtualization in distributed systems

### Types of virtualization
**Types of interfaces to computer systems, at different levels**. Important to understand the differences in virtualization

$\to$ The essence of virtualization is to mimic the behavior of these interfaces

<div style="text-align:center">

    <figcaption>Various interfaces offered by computer systems</figcaption>
</div>

* *Instruction set architecture (ISA) interface*. Interface between the hardware and software, forming the set of machine instructions
    * *Privileged instructions*. Allowed to be executed only by the OS
    * *General instructions*. Can be executed by any program
* *System call interface*. Interface consisting of system calls as offered by an OS
* *API*. Interface consisting of library calls, generally forming an API 

**Realizations of virtualization**. Virtualization can take place in two ways

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ECg2t4j.png">
    <figcaption>Process virtual machine, native virtual machine monitor, and hosted virtual machine monitor</figcaption>
</div>

* *Process virtual machine*. Build a runtime system which essentially provides an abstract instruction set, which is to be used for executing applications
    * *Purposes*. Provide a platform-independent programming environment which abstracts away details of the underlying hardware or OS
        
        $\to$ This allows a program to executes in the same way on any platform
    * *Instruction execution*. 
        * Instructions can be interpreted, e.g. Java runtime environment, or
        * Instructions can be emulated, e.g. like running Windows application on Unix platforms

            $\to$ The emulator will also have to mimic the behavior of system calls, which
has proven to be generally far from trivial
    * *"Process virtual machine" meanings*. This realization is only for a single process
        * *Explain*. The VM is created when the process is started, and destroyed when it exits
    * *Example - Java virtual machine*.
        * *Java virtual machine (JVM)*. Jvm is an interface, or middleware, between OS and Java language
            * *Functionality*. JVM provides thd environment to execute the java file, i.e. `.class` file
                
                $\to$ It depends on OS kernel, and kernel differs from OS to OS
            * *Consequence*. JVM is platform dependant
        * *Why JVM depends on the OS*.
            * *Machine code*. Computers tend to understand binary codes only, but every operating system understands this exact thing in a different manner
                * *Example*. Windows reads from `EXE` files, while they are alien to most Linux distros
                * *Consequence*. There has to be something converting any file from a known file type to the form understandable by the computer
* *Native virtual machine monitor (hypervisor)*. Provide a system, which is implemented as a layer shielding the original hardware, but offering the complete instruction set of that same, or other hardware, as an interface
    * *"Native" meanings*. This realization is implemented directly on top of the underlying hardware
    * *Concurrent offers*. The interface offered by a virtual machine monitor can be offered simultaneously to different programs

        $\to$ It is possible to have multiple, and different guest OSes run independently and concurrently on the same platform
* *Hosted virtual machine monitor (hypervisor)*. An improved version of native virtual machine monitor
    * *Drawback of native virtual machine monitor*. The monitor has to provide and regulates access to various resources, e.g. external storage and networks

        $\to$ It will have to implement device drivers for those resources
    * *Solution*. A hosted virtual machine monitor will run on top of a trusted host operating system

        $\to$ The virtual machine monitor can make use of existing facilities provided by that host operating system

        >**NOTE**. The moniotr will generally have to be given special privileges instead of running as a user-level application
    
    * *Usage*. Highly popular in modern distributed systems, e.g. data centers and clouds

## Application of virtual machines to distributed systems
**Cloud computing**. The most important application of virtualization lies in cloud computing
* *Types of services offered by cloud*.
    * *Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)*. Cover the basic infrastructure
    * *Platform-as-a-service (PaaS)*. Cover system-level services
    * *Software-as-a-service (SaaS)*. Contain actual applications
* *Roles of virtualization*. Key in IaaS, i.e. instead of renting out a physical machine, a cloud provider will rent out a virtual machine (monitor), which may or may not be sharing a physical machine with other customers

    $\to$ Virtualization allows for almost complete isolation between customers, who will have the illusion that they have just rented a dedicated physical machine
    * *Incomplete isolation*. Isolation is never complete, if only for the fact that the actual physical resources are shared, leading to observable lower performance
* *Example - Amazon elastic compute cloud (EC2)*. Allow one to create an environment consisting of several networked virtual servers, jointly forming the basis of a distributed system
    * *Amazon machine images (AMIs)*. There is a large number of pre-configured machine images available for convenience
        * *AMI format*. An installable software package consisting of an OS kernel, along with a number of services
        * *Example*. A LAMP image, consisting of a Linux kernle, the Apache Web server, a MySQL database system, and PHP libraries
        * *Launching AMI*. An EC2 customer needs to select an AMI, possibly after adapting or configuring one

            $\to$ An AMI can be launched resulting in an EC2 instance, i.e. the actual virtual machine which can be used to host a customer's applications
    * *Physical machine location*. A customer will hardly ever know exactly where an instance is actually being executed
        * *Explain*. The customer have no idea about the physical machine running the virtual machine

            $\to$ The closest one can get to know where an instance should run is by selecting one of a few regions provided by AMZ, e.g. US, South America, Europe, etc.
    * *EC2 instance communication*. 
        * *Addressing method*. Each instance obtain two IP addresses
            * A private one used for internal communication between different instances, making use of EC2's internal networking facilities
            * A public IP address allowing any Internet clients to contact an instance, which is mapped to the private one using standard NAT
        * *Instance management*. Use SSH connection, for which Amazon provides the means for generating the appropriate keys
    * *EC2 environment services*. The EC2 environment, in which an instance is executed, provides several levels of the following services
        * *CPU*. Allow to select the number and type of cores, including GPUs
        * *Memory*. Define how much main memory is allocated to an instance
        * *Platform*. Distinguishes between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures
        * *Networking*. Set the bandwidth capacity which can be used
    * *Other resources*.
        * *Extra resources*. Can be requested, e.g. additional networking interface
        * *Local storage coming with an instance*. Transient storage, i.e. when the instance stops, all the data stored locally is lost
            * *Data loss prevention*.
                * *Option 1*. A customer needs to explicitly save data to persistent store, e.g. Amazon S3
                * *Option 2*. Attach a storage device, which is mapped to Amazon's Elastic Block Store (EBS), which is another service, which can be used in the form of a virtual block device mounted as a hard disk

                    $\to$ When an instance is stopped, all data stored on EBS will persist, and the EBS can be remounted to any other instance

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Virtual machine (VM)**. The virtualization, or emulation, of a computer system
* *History*. Virtual machine was originally defined as an efficient, isolated duplicate of a real computer machine
    * *Host and guest machines*. A host can emulate several guests, each of which can emulate different OSes and hardware platforms
        * *Host*. The physical, real-world hardware running the VM
        * *Guest*. The virtual machine emulated on the host machine
    * *Motivation*. The desire to run multiple OSes 
* *Types of virtual machines*.
    * *System virtual machines (Full virtualization VMs)*. Provide a substitute for a real machine, i.e. they provide functionality required to execute entire OSes
    * *Process virtual machines*. Designed to execute computer programs in a platform-independent environment

**Hypervisor**. A kind of emulator, i.e. computer software, firmware, or hardware, which creates and runs virtual machines
* *Host and guest machines*.
    * *Host machine*. A computer, on which a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machines
    * *Guest machine*. Each virtual machine running on host machine 
* *Idea*. Present the guest OSes with a virtual operating platform and manage the execution of the guest OSes
    * *Virtualized resources sharing*. Multiple instances of multiple OSes may share the virtualized hardware resources

        $\to$ This contrasts with OS-level virtualization, where all instances, i.e. containers, must share a single kernel, though the gues OSes can differ in user space, e.g. different Linux distributions with the same kernel
* *Types of hypervisors*.

        <figcaption>Native and hosted hypervisors</figcaption>
    </div>

    * *Native or bare-metal hypervisors*. Run directly on the host's hardware to control the hardware and to manage guest OSes

        $\to$ For this reason, they are sometimes called bare-metal hypervisors
    * *Hosted hypervisors*. Run on a conventional OS, as other computer programs do, and guest OS runs as a process on the host

        $\to$ Guest OS is abstracted from the host OS

## Discussion
**Stable software**. Though a lot of legacy software can benefit from stable interfaces to rapidly changing underlying hardware

$\to$ It is a mistake to believe that the software for widely available services hardly changes
* *Explain*. With the increasing shift toward server-side computing in the form of software-as-a-service (SaaS)

    $\to$ Much software can be maintained for a relatively homogeneous platform, owned entirely by the organization offering the associated service
    * *Consequence*. Maintaining software products can be much easier, since there is much lesser need to distribute changes to potentially millions of customers

>**NOTE**. Changes may rapidly succeed each other following changes in available hardware and platform, without any client actually noticing downtimes
