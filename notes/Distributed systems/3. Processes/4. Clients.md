# Clients
## Networked user interfaces
**Major task of client machines**. Provide the means for users to interact with remote servers

* *Interaction options*.
    * *Option 1*. For each remote service, the client machine will have a separate counterpart, which can contact the service over the network
        * *Example*. A calendar running on a user's smartphone needing to synchronize with a remote, possibly shared calandar

            $\to$ An application-level protocol will handle the synchronization
    * *Option 2*. Provide direct access to remote services by offering only a convenient user interface

        $\to$ The client machine is used only as a terminal with no need for local storage, leading to an application-neutral solution
        * *Other name*. Thin-client approach
        * *Consequences*. Everything is processed and stored at the server
        * *Popularity*. Thin-client solutions has received much attention with the increase of Internet connectivity and the use of mobile devices
            * *Explain*. Thin-client solutions ease the task of system management

### Example - The X window system
**X window system (or X)**. Used to control bit-mapped terminals, which include a monitor, keyboard, and a pointing device, e.g. a mouse

    <figcaption>The basic organization of the X window system</figcaption>
</div>

* *Supporting devices*.
    * Traditional terminals, e.g. found on desktop computers and workstations
    * Modern devices, e.g. touchscreens on tablets and smartphones
* *X as part of an OS*. X can be viewed as part of an OS controlling the terminals
* *X kernel*. The heart of the system, which contains all the terminal-specific device drivers, and is generally highly hardware dependent
    * *Offered services*. A relatively low-level interface for controling the screen, and for capturing events from the keyboard and mouse
* *Xlib*. X kernel's interface is available to applications as library called `Xlib`

    >**NOTE**. Xlib is hardly used directly by applications, which instead deploy easier to use toolkits implemented on top of Xlib

**Distributed X**. X kernel and the X applications need not necessarily reside on the same machine
* *X protocol*. X provides X protocol, which is an application-level communication protocol, by which an instance of Xlib can exchange data and events with an X kernel

### Thin-client network computing
**Application logic and user-interface commands**. Applications written for X should preferably separate application logic from user-interface command, but it is often not the case
* *Explain*. Application logic and user interaction are tightly coupled, i.e. an application will send many requests to the X kernel, for which it will expect a response before making a next step
    * *Consequence*. This synchronous behavior may adversely affect performance when operating over a WAN with long latencies

**Solution 1 - Protocol re-engineering**. Re-engineer the implementation of X protocol, as is done with NX
* *Re-engineering objectives*. Bandwidth reduction by reducing the size of X messages

    $\to$ Messages are considered to consist of a fixed part, which is treated as an identifier, and a variable part
    * *Observation*. In many cases, multiple messages will have the same identifier, in which case they will often contain similar data

        $\to$ We can only send the differences between messages having the same identifier
* *Consequence*. Bandwidth reductions up to a factor 1000 have been reported, allowing X to run through low-bandwidth links

**Solution 2 - Direct bit-map control by application**. Let an application completely control the remote display, i.e. up to pixel level

$\to$ Changes in the bitmap are sent over the network to the display, where they are immediately transferred to the local frame buffer
* *Virtual network computing (VNC)*. A well-known example of this approach
* *Problem*. Sophisticated encoding techniques are required to prevent bandwidth availability to become a problem
* *Drawback compared with solution 1*. It is impossible to make any use of application semantics, as these are effectively lost at the level
    * *Proposed approach by THINC*. Provide a few high-level display commands, which operate at the level of the video device drivers

        $\to$ These commands are device dependent, more powerful than raw pixel operations, but less powerful compared to X protocol

## Client-side software for distribution transparency
**Client software with processing**. In many cases, parts of processing and data level in a client-server application are executed on the client side

$\to$ The UI is a relatively small part of the client software, in contrast to local processing and communication facilities
* *Distribution transparency*. Besides the UI and other application-related softrware, client software comprises components for achieving distribution transparency
    * *Ideal case*. A client should not be aware that it is communicating with remote processes

    >**NOTE**. Distribution is often less transparent to servers for reasons of performance and correctness

**Types of transparency**. 
* *Access transparency*. Generally handled through the generation of a client stub, from an interface definition of what the server has to offer
    * *Client stub*.
        * Provide the same interface as the one available at the server, hiding the possible differences in machien architectures and the actual communication
        * Transform local calls to messages which are sent to the server, and vice versa
* *Location, migration, and relocation transparency*. Using a convenient naming system is crucial, as well as cooperation with client-side software
    * *Example*. When a client is already bound to a server, the client can be directly informed when the server changes location

        $\to$ The client's middleware can hide the server's current network location from the user, and also transparently rebind to the server if required
* *Replication transparency*. Given a distributed system with replicated servers, the client will forward a request to each replica and transparently collect all responses and pass a single response to the client application

    </div>

* *Failure transparency*. Masking communication failures with a server is typically done through client middleware
    * *Example*. Client middleware can be configured to 
        * Repeatedly attempt to connect to a server, or 
        * Try another server after several attempts, or
        * Return cached data during a previous session, when fail to connect to a server
* *Concurrency transparency*. Handled through special intermediate servers, notably transaction monitors, and requires less support from client software
