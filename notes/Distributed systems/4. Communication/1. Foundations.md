# Foundations
## Introduction
**Interprocess communication**. The heart of all distributed systems, i.e. it makes no sense to study distributed systems without carefully examining the ways processes on different machines can exchange information
* *Traditional approach*. Based on low-level message passing as offered by the underlying network
    * *Motivation*. Modern distributed systems often consist of thousands of or even millions of processes scattered across a network with unreliable communication, e.g. the Internet

        $\to$ Unless the primitive communication facilities of computer networks are replaced by something else, development of large-scale distributed applications is extremely difficult
    * *Drawback*. Expressing communication through message passing is harder than using primitives based on shared memory, as available for nondistributed platforms

**Protocols**. The rules which communicating processes must adhere to

$\to$ Protocols can be structured in the form of layers

## Layered protocols
**Low-level message passing**. Due to the absense of shared memory, all communication in distributed systems is based on sending and receiving low-level messages
* *Explain*. When process $P$ wants to communicate with process $Q$, it first builds a message in its own address space

    $\to$ $P$ then executes a system call causing the OS to send the message over the network to $Q$
* *Needs for protocols*. To prevent chaos, $P$ and $Q$ need to agree on the meaning of the bits being sent

### The OSI reference model
**Open systems interconnection (OSI) reference model**. A reference modle developed by the ISO, which clearly identifies the various levels involved, gives them standard names, and points out which level should do which job

$\to$ To make it easier to deal with numerous levels and issues involved in communication
* *Other names*. ISO OSI, or OSI model
* *PUrpose of studing OSI model* Protocols developed as part of the OSI model were never widely used and are essentially dead

    $\to$ However, this model is useful for understanding computer networks

* *OSI reference model*.

**Communication protocols**. The OSI model is designed to allow open systems, i.e. ones prepared to communicate with any other open system by using standard rules governing the format, contents, and meaning of messages, to communicate
* *Communication protocols*. Rules for messages

    $\to$ To allow a group of computers to communicate over a network, they must agree on the protocls to be used
    * *Communication service*. A protocol is said to provide a communication service
* *Types of services*.
    * *Connection-oriented service*. Before exchanging data, the sender and receiver must explicitly establish a connection, and possibly negotiate specific parameters of the protocol they will use

        $\to$ When finished, they release, i.e. terminate, the connection
    * *Connectionless service*. No setup in advance is required, i.e. the sender just transmits the first message when it is ready

**Protocol stack (or protocol suite)**. The collection of protocols used in a particular system

### Middleware protocols
**Middleware**. An application, which logically lives mostly in the OSI application layer, but contains many general-purpose protocols which warrent their own layers, independent of other, more specific applications

</div>

* *Examples*. The following examples are not directly tied to communication
    * *DNS*. A distributed service used to look up a network address associated with a name
        * *Explain*. DNS is offering a general-purpose, application-independent service, thus it forms part of the middleware
    * *Authentication protocols*. Not closely tied to any specific application, but can be integrated into a middleware system as a general service
    * *Atomicity in distributed commit protocols*. In a group of processes, possibly spread out across a number of machines, either all processes carry out a particular operation, or that the operation is not carried out at all
        * *Usage*. Widely applied in transactions
        * *Explain*. Commit protocols can present an interface independently of specific applications, thus providing a general-purpose transaction service
    * *Ditributed locking protocol*. A resource can be protected against simultaneously access by a collection of processes, which are distributed across multiple machines
* *Middleware communication protocols*.
    * Remote procedure call
    * High-level communication services for setting and synchronizing streams for transferring real-time data
    * Reliable multicast services, which scale to thousands of receivers spread across a WAN

## Types of communication
**Distinguishing types of middleware communication**. To understand the various alternatives in communication, which middleware can offer to applications, we view the middleware as an additional service in client-server computing

    <figcaption>Middleware as an intermediate distributed service in application-level communication</figcaption>
</div>

* *Example*. Consider an electronic mail system
    * *Middleware communication service*. The core of the mail delivery system (in principle)
    * *Application layer*. Each host runs a user ageent allowing users to compose, send, and receive e-mails
    * *Mail sending*.
        * A sending user agent passes such mail to the mail delivery system, expecting it, in turn, to eventually deliver the mail to the intended recipient
        * The user agent at the receiver's side connects to the mail delivery system to see whether any mail has comes in

            $\to$ If so, the messages are transferred to the user agent, so that they can be displayed and read by the user

**Persistent and transient communication**.
* *Persistent communication*. A message, which has been submitted for transmission is stored by the communication middleware as along as it takes to deliver it to the receiver
    * *Example*. E-mail system
    * *Storage devices*. The middleware stores the message at one or several of the storage facilities
        * *Consequences*. 
            * It is not necessary for the sending application to continue execution after submitting the message
            * The receiving application need not be executing when the message is submitted
* *Transient communication*. A message is stored by the communication system only as long as the sending and receiving application are executing
    
    $\to$ If the middleware cannot deliver a message due to some reasons, it will simply discard the message
    * *Transposrt-level communication services*. Typically offer only transient communication

        $\to$ The communication system consists of traditional store-and-forward routers, which will simply drop a message if they cannot deliver it to the next neighborhood or the destination host

**Asynchronous and synchronous communication**.
* *Asynchronous communication*. A sender continues immediately after it has submitted its message for transmission

    $\to$ The message is temporarily stored immediately by the middleware upon submission
* *Synchronous communication*. The sender is blocked until its request is known to be accepted
    * *Possible points of synchronization*.
        * *Option 1*. The sender may synchornize until the middleware notifies that it will take over transmission of the request
        * *Option 2*. The sender may synchronize until its request has been delivered to the intended recipient
        * *Option 3*. Synchronization may take place by letting the sender wait until its request has been fully processed, i.e. up to the time that the recipient returns a response

**Combination of persistence and synchronization**. 
* Popular ones are persistence in combination with synchronization at request submission, which is common scheme for many message-queuing systems
* Transient communication with synchronization after the request has been fully processed is also widely used, e.g. common for remote procedure calls

## Concepts
**Recovery manager**. The component responsible for processing commit, abort operations, and restart operations
* *Operations carried out by recovery manager*.
    * *Commit operations*. $\ce{Commit(T_i)}$ permanently installs $T_i$’s updated pages into the stable database
        * *Atomicity*. Its effect must be atomic, i.e. all-or-nothing, even in the event of a system failure
            * *Explain*. Either all actions in a transaction are done, or none are done
        * *Inrrevocability*. Its effect is irrevocable, i.e. once the transaction is committed, it cannot subsequently be aborted
    * *Abort operations*. Restores all the data that $T_i$ updated to the values it had before $T_i$ executed
        * *Inrrevocability*. Like commit, its effect is irrevocable, i.e. once the transaction is aborted, it cannot subsequently be committed
    * *Restart operation*. Initiate recovery from a system failure, to bring the database back into a consistent state where it can process transactions again
        * *Explain*. 
            * Aborts all transactions that were active at the time of the system failure
            * Any updates by committed transactions that were not installed in the stable database before the failure are installed now
                * *Explain*. They may have been written only to the log and may not have made it to the stable database before the failure
        * *Consequence*. The result should be that the database contains all committed updates and no aborted ones

**Distributed DBMS - Commit protocols**.
* *Motivation*. Transaction may access data at several sites

    <div style="text-align:center">

        <figcaption>Transaction manager and transaction coordinator</figcaption>
    </div>

    * *Local transaction manager*. Each site has a local transaction manager responsible for executing the local transactions and maintain access to the data stored locally, i.e.
        * Maintaining a log for recovery purposes
        * Participating in coordinating the concurrent execution of transactions executing at the site
    * *Local transaction coordinator*. Each site has a transaction coordinator, which is responsible for coordinateing the execution of several transactions (global and local) initiated locally, i.e.
        * Starting the execution of transactions, which originate at the site
        * Distributing subtransactions at appropriate sites for execution
        * Coordinating the termination of each transaction, which originates at the site, which may result in the transaction being commited at all sites or aborted at all sites
    * *Failures unique to distributed systems*.
        * Failure of a site
        * Loss of message, i.e. handled by TCP
        * Failure of communication link, i.e. handled by network protocols, by routing messages via alternative links
        * Network partition, i.e. a network is partitioned when it has been splitted into two or more subsystems, which may lack any connection between them

            $\to$ Network partitioning and site failures are generally indistinguishable
* *Needs for commit protocols*. Commit protocols are used to ensure atomicity across sites, i.e.
    * *Local DBMS*. For committing a transaction, the transaction manager has to only convey the decision to commit to the recovery manager
    * *Distributed system*. The transaction manager should convey the decision to commit to all the servers in the various sites where the transaction is being executed and uniformly enforce the decision
        * When processing is complete at each site, it reaches the partially committed transaction state and waits for all other transactions to reach their partially committed states
        * When it receives the message that all the sites are ready to commit, it starts to commit
        
            $\to$ In a distributed system, either all sites commit or none of them does
* *Types of commit protocols*.
    * *One-phase commit (1PC) protocol*. The simplest form
    * *Two-phase commit (2PC) protocol*. Widely used
    * *Three-phase commit (3PC) protocol*. The most complicated form and more expensive, but avoid some drawbacks of 2PC

        >**NOTE**. 3PC is not used in practice

* *Distributed one-phase commit*. The simplest commit protocol
    * *Procedure*.
        1. After each slave has locally completed its transaction, it sends a “DONE” message to the controlling site
        2. The slaves wait for “Commit” or “Abort” message from the controlling site
            
            $\to$ This waiting time is called window of vulnerability
        3. When the controlling site receives “DONE” message from each slave, it makes a decision to commit or abort
            
            $\to$ This is called the commit point 
        4. Then, it sends this message to all the slaves
        5. On receiving this message, a slave either commits or aborts and then sends an acknowledgement message to the controlling site
    * *Window of vulnerability*. Within this WoV, the participants will be waiting to hear message from the coordinator
        * If the coordinator fails in this window, the transaction will be in a blocked state
        * If not, Commit or Abort message is broadcasted to the participants by the coordinator

            $\to$ After receiving the message, the participants execute the transaction and acknowledge the message from coordinator
    * *Effect of blocked state*. When a participant finished working on the transaction early, it must wait for large duration and the resources used by the transaction must be locked at various sites

        $\tp$ Locked resources are not available to other transactions
        * *Critical issue with 1PC*. The failure of coordinator within the window of vulnerability, due to which the participants stay blocked for very long period of time
            * *Explain*. The participants cannot decide unilaterally the commit or abort of a transaction, in case of coordinator failure
* *Distributed two-phase commit*. Reduce the vulnerability of one-phase commit protocols
    * *Procedure*.
        * *Prepare phase*.
            1. After each slave has locally completed its transaction, it sends a “DONE” message to the controlling site
                
                $\to$ When the controlling site has received “DONE” message from all slaves, it sends a “Prepare” message to the slaves
            2. The slaves vote on whether they still want to commit or not
                * If a slave wants to commit, it sends a “Ready” message
                * A slave that does not want to commit sends a “Not Ready” message, i.e. this may happen when the slave has conflicting concurrent transactions or there is a timeout
        * *Commit - abort phase*. 
            * After the controlling site has received “Ready” message from all the slaves
                1. The controlling site sends a “Global Commit” message to the slaves
                2. The slaves apply the transaction and send a “Commit ACK” message to the controlling site
                3. When the controlling site receives “Commit ACK” message from all the slaves, it considers the transaction as committed
            * After the controlling site has received the first “Not Ready” message from any slave −
                1. The controlling site sends a “Global Abort” message to the slaves.
                2. The slaves abort the transaction and send a “Abort ACK” message to the controlling site
                3. When the controlling site receives “Abort ACK” message from all the slaves, it considers the transaction as aborted
