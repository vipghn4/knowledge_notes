# Multicast communication
**An important topic in communication in distributed systems**. The support for sending data to multiple receivers, i.e. multicast communication
* *History*.
    * For many years, this topic has belonged to the domain of network protocols, where numerous proposals for network-level and transport-level solutions have been implemented and evaluated
        * *Major issue*. 
            * Setting up the communication paths for information dissemination
            * As long as there is no convergence of proposals, ISPs have shown to be reluctant to support multicasting
    * With the advent of P2P technology, and notably structured overlay management, it is easier to set up communication paths
        * *Explain*. P2P solutions are typically deployed at the application layer, introducing various application-level multicasting techniques

## Application-level tree-based multicasting
**Basic idea in application-level multicasting**. Nodes organize into an overlay network, which is then used to disseminate information to its member
* *Routing in overlay network*. The network routers are not involved in group memberships, thus the connections between nodes in the overlay network may cross several physical links

    $\to$ Routing messages within the overlay may not be optimal in comparison to what could have been achieved by network-level routing
* *Crucial design issue*. The construction of the overlay network
    * *Approach 1*. Nodes may organize themselves directly into a tree, i.e. there is a unique overlay path between every pair of nodes
    * *Approach 2*. Nodes organize into a mesh network, in which every node will have multiple neighbors and, in general, there exist multiple paths between every pair of nodes

        $\to$ This provides higher robustness
        * *Robustness*. If a connection breaks, e.g. due to a node failure, there will still be an opportunity to disseminate information without having to immediately reorganize the entire overlay network

### Performance issues in overlays
**Problem**. How to build an efficient tree of nodes

</div>

* *Scenario*. Node A forms the root of a multicast tree
* *Observation*. Whenenever A multicasts a message to other nodes, the links (B, Rb), (Ra, Rb), (E, Re), and (D, Rd) are traversed twice

    $\to$ The overlay network would have been more efficient if we had not constructed overlay links
* *Performance metrics of an application-level multicast tree*.
    * *Link stress*. Defined per link and count how often a packet crosses the same link
        * *Link stress greater than 1*. Although logically, a packet may be forwarded along two different connections

            $\to$ Part of those connections may actually correspond to the same physical link
    * *Stretch (relative delay penalty - RDP)*. Measure the ratio in delay between two nodes in the overlay, and the delay that two two nodes would experience in the underlying network
    * *Tree cost*. A global metric, generally related to minimizing the aggregated link costs
        * *Example*. Optimizing the tree cost is to find a minimal spanning tree, in which the total time for multicasting information to all nodes is minimal

**Rendezvous node**. A well-known node associated with a multicast group, which keeps track of the nodes joining the tree
* *Node joining*. When a new node issues a join request, it contacts this rendezvous node to obtain a potentially list of members

    $\to$ The new node then selects the best member, which can operate as the new node's parent in the tree
* *Parent node selection*. If the multicast group has only a single source, then the parent node would be the source, leading to a star topology with the source in the middle
    * *Problem*. The source can easily become overloaded
    * *Consequence*. Selection of a node will be constrained so that only those nodes may be chosen who have $k$ or less neighbors, with $k$ is chosen beforehand

        $\to$ This may severely complicate the tree-establishment algorithm, as a good solution may require that part of the existing tree is reconfigured

## Flooding-based multicasting
**Broadcasting and multicasting**. 
* *Broadcasting*. When a message is to be multicast, it is to be received by every node in the overlay network
* *Multicasting*. Sending a message to a subset of all the nodes, i.e. a specific group of nodes

**Key design issue of multicast**. Minimize the use of intermediate nodes, for which the message is not intended
* *Explain*. If the overlay is organized as a multi-level tree, where only leaf nodes are ones who should receive a multicast message

    $\to$ There may be some nodes, who need to store and subsequently forward a message, which is not meant for them
* *Solution*. Construct an overlay network per multicast group

    $\to$ Multicasting a message to a group is the same as broadcasting the message within the group
    * *Drawback*. A node belonging to several groups will, in principle, need to maintain a separate list of its neighbors for each group, of which it is a member

**Flooding**. If we assume that an overlay corresponds to a multicast group, hence we need to broadcast a message

$\to$ A naive way of doing so is to apply flooding
* *Idea*. 
    * Each node simply forwards a message to each of its neighbors, except to the one, from which it received the message
    * If a node keeps track of the messages it received and forwarded, it can ignore duplicates
* *Problem*. Roughly twice as many messages being sent as there are links in the overlay network, making flooding quite inefficient
    * *Ideal case*. When the graph is a tree, then flooding would be optimal
    * *Worst case*. When the graph is fully connected, then flooding would explode

**Random group**. Suppose we have no information on the structure of the overlay network, and the best we can assume is that it can be represented as a random graph
* *Scenario*. With probability $p_e$ that two nodes are joined, and a total of $N (N - 1)$ edges

    $\to$ The expected number of edges is $M=\frac{1}{2} p_e N (N - 1)$
* *Probabilistic flooding*. A strategy to reduce the number of messages
    * *Idea*. When a node is flooding a message, and needs to forward the message to a specific neighborhood

        $\to$ It will do so with a probability $p_f$, leading to linearly decrement in the number of messages sent
    * *Risk*. The lower $p_f$, the higher the chance that not all nodes in the network will be reached

        $\to$ If a node has $n$ neighbors then the probability that it does not receive the message is $(1 - p_f)^n$
        * *Consequence*. The number of neighbors plays an important role in deciding whether or not to forward a message

            $\to$ We can replace the static probability of forwarding with one taking the degree of the neighbor into account
* *Deterministic flooding*. Dealing with a structured overlay, i.e. one having a more or less deterministic topology

    $\to$ Designing efficient flooding schemes is simpler

## Gossip-based data dissemination
**Epidemic behavior (or gossiping)**. A technique for spreading information in very large-scale distributed systems motivated by observing how diseases spread among people
* *Main goal of epidemic protocols*. Rapidly propagate information among a large collection of nodes, using only local information

    $\to$ There is no central component, by which information dissemination is coordinated
* *Assumptions*. All updates for a specific data item are initiated at a single node

    $\to$ In this way, we simply avoid write-write conflicts

### Information dissemination models
**Fundamental idea**. In a large-scale distributed system, instead of spreading diseases, information is spreaded

$\to$ Whereas health organization organizations try to prevent infectious diseases from spreading across large groups of people, designers of epidemic algorithms try to infect all nodes with new information as fast as possible
* *Types of nodes*.
    * *Infected node*. A node is called infected if it holds data, which it is willing to spread to other nodes
    * *Susceptible node*. A node which has not seen the data yet
    * *Removed node*. An updated node, which is not willing or able to spread its data

    >**NOTE**. We asume we can distinguish old from new data, e.g. by timestamping or versioning
    >$\to$ Nodes are said to spread updates

**Anti-entropy**. A popular propagation model
* *Idea*. A node P picks another node Q at random, and subsequently exchanges updates with Q, following one of the three approaches for exchanging updates
    * *Option 1*. P only pulls in new updates from Q
    * *Option 2*. P only pushes its own updates to Q
    * *Option 3*. P and Q send updates to each other, i.e. push-pull approach
* *Choice of exchanging update strategy*.
    * *Option 1*. Only pushing updates is a bad choice, i.e.
        * *Explain*. In a pure push-based model, updates can be propagated only by infected nodes

            $\to$ If many nodes are infected, the probability of each one selecting a susceptible node is relatively small
        * *Consequence*. Chances are that a particular node remains susceptible for a long period simply because it is not selected by an infected node
    * *Option 2*. The pull-based approach works much better when many nodes are infected
        * *Explain*. Spreading updates is essentially triggered by susceptible nodes

            $\to$ Chances are big that such a node will contact an infected one to pull in the updates and become infected as well
    * *Option 3*. The best strategy
* *Round*. A round spans a period, in which every node will have taken the initiative once to exchange updates with a randomly chosen other node
    * *Number of rounds to propagate a single update to all nodes*. $O(\log N)$ where $N$ is the number of nodes
        * *Explain*. Refer to binary search complexity
    * *Consequence*. Propagating updates is fast, and scalable

**Rumor spreading**. A variant of epidemic protocols
* *Idea*.
    * If node P has just seen updated for data item $x$, it contacts an arbitrary other node Q, trying to push the update to Q
    * If Q was already updated by another node, P may lose interest in spreading the update further, i.e. with probability $p_\text{stop}$

        $\to$ P becomes removed
* *Real life analogy*. When Bob has some hot news to spread around, he may phone his friend Alice telling her about it

    $\to$ Bob will be disappointed when Alice has known the news already
* *Problem*. This strategy cannot guarantee that all nodes will actually be updated
    * *Formal*. When there is large number of nodes in the epidemics, the fraction $s$ of nodes, which will remain ignorant of an update is given as

        $$s = \exp(-(\frac{1}{p_\text{stop}} + 1) (1 - s))$$

**Main advantage of epidemic algorithms**. Scalability, i.e. the number of synchronizations between processes is relatively small, compared to other propagation methods
* *Directional gossiping*. Taking the actual network topology into account will result in better performance
    * *Idea*. Nodes which are connected to only a few other nodes are contacted with a relatively high probability
    * *Assumption*. Weakly connected nodes form a bridge to other remote parts of the network

        $\to$ They should be contacted as soon as possible

**Drawback of epidemic solutions**. These solutions made an assumption that a node can randomly select any other node to gossip with

$\to$ The complete set of nodes should be known to each member
* *Problem*. In a large system, this assumption can never hold and special measures are needed to mimic such properties

### Removing data
**Spreading the deletion of a data item in epidemic solutions**. Extremely hard
* *Explain*. Deletion of a data item destroys all information on the item

    $\to$ When a data item is removed from a node, that node will eventually receive old copies of the data item, and interpret those as updates on something it did not have before
* *Solution*. Record the deletion of a data item as another update, and keep a record of that deletion

    $\to$ Old copies will not be interpreted as something new, but merely treated as versions, which have been updated by a delete operation
* *Death certificates*. The recording of a deletion

**Memory management**. Death certificates should eventually be cleaned up, otherwise each node will gradually build a huge local database of historical information on deleted data items
* *Solution*. Use dormant death certificates, i.e. each death certificate is timestamped when created
    * *Idea*. If it can be assumed that updates propagate to all nodes within a known finite time

        $\to$ Death certificates can be removed after this maximum propagation time as elapsed
* *Keeping death certificates*. To provide hard guarantees that deletions are spread to all nodes, only a very few nodes maintain dormant death certificates, which are nevery thrown away
    * *Explain*. Assume node P has a certificate for data item $x$, then if an obsolete update for $x$ reaches P

        $\to$ P will react by spreading the death certificate for $x$ again
