# Client-centric consistency models
**Data-centric consistency model**. Aim at providing a systemwide consistent view on a data store
* *Assumption*. 
    * Concurrent processes may be simultaneously updating the data store
    * It is necessary to provide consistency
* *Fundamental of distributed system*. Handle concurrent operations on shared data, while maintaining strong consistency
* *Strong consistency guarantee*. For performance reasons, 
    * Strong consistency can be guaranteed only when processes use mechanisms like transactions, or synchronization variables
    * It may be impossible to guarantee strong consistency, and weaker forms need to be accepted, e.g. causal consistency or eventual consistency
* *Hiding inconsistencies*.
    * *Data store of interest*. In this section, we consider data stores
        * Characterized by the lack of simultaneous updates, or when such updates happen
            
            $\to$ It is assumed that they can be relatively easily resolved
        * Most operations involve reading data
    * *Effects*. These data stores offer a weak consistency model, e.g. eventual consistency

        $\to$ By introducing special client-consistency models, many inconsistencies can be hidden in a relatively cheap way
    * *Key idea*. Eventually consistent data stores generally work fine as long as clients always access the same replica

**Problem**. Arise when different replicas are accessed over a short period of time

</div>

* *Example*. Consdier a user, who is not aware of which replica it is actually operating
    
    $\to$ If the user operates on a replica, then disconnects, the reconnects but to another replica, then its update may not be propagated to the new replica
    * *Consequence*. The user would expect to see all previously made changes, but instead it appears as if nothing happened
    * *Conclusion*. The problem is caused by the fact that users may sometimes operate on different replicas, while updates have not been fully propagated
* *Solution*. Introduce client-centric consistency

**Client-centric consistency**. Provide guarantees for a single client concerning the consistency of accesses to a data store by that client
* *Drawback*. No guarantees are given concerning concurrent accesses by different clients
    * *Example*. 
        * If Bob modifies data, which is shared with Alice, but which is stored at a different location

            $\to$ We may easily create write-write conflicts
        * If neither Alice nor Bob access the same location for some time
            
            $\to$ Such conflicts may take a long time before they are discovered
* *Client-centric consistency models*. Originate from the work on Bayou and, more general, from mobile-data system
    * *Bayou*. A database system developed for mobile computing 
        * *Characteristic*. It is assumed that network connectivityis unreliable and subject to various performance problems
            * *Example*. Wireless networks and large-area networks
    * *Four consistency models of Bayou*. Consider a data store, which is physically distributed across multiple machines
        1. When a process accesses the data store, it generally connects to the locally, or nearest, availably copy
        2. All read and write operations are performed on that local copy
        3. Updates are eventually propagated to other copies
* *Notations*.
    * $x_i$ is the version of item $x$, which is the result of a series of write operations taking place since initialization
        * *Write set $\text{WS}(x_i)$*. The series of write operations taking place from initialization to $x_i$
    * $\text{WS}(x_i;x_j)$ indicates that $x_j$ follows from $x_i$
    * $\text{WS}(x_i|x_j)$ indicates that we do not know if $x_j$ follows from $x_i$

## Monotonic reads
**Monotonic reads**. The first client-centric consistency model
* *Monotonic reads*. A distributed data store is said to provide monotonic-read consistency if the following condition holds
    * *Condition for monotonic reads*. If a process reads the value of a data item $x$, any successive read operation on $x$ by that process will alawys return that same value, or a more recent value

        $\to$ Monotonic-read consistency guarantees that once a process has seen a value of $x$, it will never see an older version of $x$
    * *Applications*. Distributed e-mail database

## Monotonic writes
**Monotonic writes**. It is important that write operations are propagated in the correct order to all copies of the data store
* *Monotonic writes*. A distributed data store is said to provide monotonic-write consistency if the following condition holds
    * *Condition for monotonic writes*. A write operation by a process on a data item $x$ is completed before any successive write operation on $x$ by the same process
        * *Formal*. If we have two successive oeprations $W_k(x_i)$ and $W_k(x_j)$ by $P_k$

            $\to$ Regardless where $W_k(x_j)$ takes palce, we also have $\text{WS}(x_i;x_j)$
    * *Consequence*. Completing a write operation means that the copy, on which a successive operation is performed, reflects the effect of previous write operation by the same process, no matter where that operation was initiated

        $\to$ A write operation on a copy of $x$ is performed only if that copy has been up-to-date by means of any preceding write operation by that same process, which may have taken place on other copies of $x$

        >**NOTE**. If needed, the new write must wait for old ones to finish

**Data-centric FIFO consistency**. Monotonic-write consistency resembles data-centric FIFO consistency
* *Essence of FIFO consistency*. Write operations by the same process are performed in the correct order everywhere
* *Difference from monotonic writes*. Monotonic writes concerns only consistency for a single process, rather than a collection of concurrent processes

**Keeping data store up-to-date**. Bringing a copy of $x$ up to date is not necessary when each write operation completely overwrites the present value of $x$

$\to$ HOwever, write operations are often performed on only part of $x$

**Weaker form of monotonic writes**. The effects of a write operation are seen only if all preceding writes have been carried out as well, but may not in the order, in which they have been originally initiated
* *Example*. This is applicable in case write operations are commutative, hence the ordering is really not necessary

## Read your writes
**Read-your-writes consistency**. A data store is read-your-writes consistency if the effect of a write operation by a process on data item $x$ will always be seen by a successive read operation on $x$ by the same process

$\to$ A write operation is always completed before a successive read operation by the same process, no matter where the read operation takes place
* *Example*. 
    * The absence of read-your-writes consistency is sometimes experienced when updating Web documents and subsequently viewing the effects
    * Similar effects occur when updating passwords, i.e. changing a password may take some time to come into effect

        $\to$ The Web site may be inaccessible to the user for a few minutes

## Write follow reads
**Write-follow-reads consistency**. A data store is write-follow-reads consistency if a write operation by a process on a data item $x$ following a previous read operation on $x$ by the same process is guaranteed to take place on the same or more recent value of $x$, which was read

$\to$ Any successive write operation by a process on $x$ will be performed on a copy of $x$, which is up-to-date with the value most recently read by that process
* *Application*. Used to guarantee that users of a network newsgroup see a posting of reaction to an article only after they have seen the original article
