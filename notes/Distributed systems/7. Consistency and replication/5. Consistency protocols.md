# Consistency protocols
**Consistency protocols**. Describe an implementation of a specific consistency model

## Continuous consistency
**Continuous consistency**. Yu and Vahdat (2000) have developed a number of protocols to tackle the three forms of consistency

### Bounding numerical deviation
**Idea**. Consider write operations on a data item $x$
* *Assumptions*.
    * $W(x)$ is a write with an associated value $\text{val}(W(x))$, or $\text{val}(W)$ representing the numerical value, by which $x$ is updated
        * $\text{val}(W) > 0$ is assumed
    * *Write's origin*. Each write $W$ is initially submitted to one out of the $N$ available replica servers

        $\to$ In this case, the server becomes the write's origin, denoted as $\text{origin}(W)$
    * *Log of writes*. At any specific moment in time, there are several submitted writes required to be propagated to all servers
        
        $\to$ Each server $S_i$ will keep track of a log $L_i$ of writes, which it has preformed on its own local copy of $x$
    * *The effect of performing the writes executed by $S_i$ that originated from $S_j$*.

        $$\text{TW}[i,j] = \sum \{\text{val}(W):\text{origin}(W)=S_j \land W\in L_i\}$$

        * *Explain*. $\text{TW}[i,i]$ represents the aggregated writes submitted to $S_i$
* *Objective for any time $t$*. Let the current value $v_i$ of $x$ at $S_i$ deviate within bounds from the actual value $v$ of $x$
    * *Actual value of $x$*. Determined by all submitted writes, i.e. if $v_0$ is the initial value of $x$, then

        $$v = v_0 + \sum_{k=1}^N \text{TW}[k,k],\quad v_i = v_0 + \sum_{k=1}^N \text{TW}[i,k]$$
    * *Upperbound on absolute deviation*. Since $v_i\leq v$, thus, for every server $S_i$, we associate an upperbound $\delta_i$ we want to enforce

        $$v-v_i\leq \delta_i$$
* *Write propagation*. Writes submitted to $S_i$ will need to be propagated to all other servers, according to several ways

**Epidemic protocol**. Allow rapid dissemination of updates
* *Observations*. 
    * When $S_i$ propagates a write originating from $S_j$ to $S_k$

        $\to$ $S_k$ can learn about $\text{TW}[i,j]$ at the time the write was sent
        * *Explain*. $S_k$ can maintain a view $\text{TW}_k[i,j]$ of what it believes $S_i$ will have as the value for $\text{TW}[i,j]$
    * We have that

        $$0\leq \text{TW}_k[i,j] \leq \text{TW}[i,j] \leq \text{TW}[j,j]$$
* *Idea*. When $S_k$ notices that $S_i$ has not been staying in the right pace with updates submitted to $S_k$

    $\to$ It forwards writes from its log to $S_i$
    * *Consequence*. This forwarding effectively advances the view $\text{TW}_k[i,k]$ that $S_k$ has of $\text{TW}[i,k]$

        $\to$ This makes $\text{TW}[i,k]-\text{TW}_k[i,k]$ smaller
* *Implementation*. $S_k$ advances its view on $\text{TW}[i,k]$ when an application submits a new write increasing $\text{TW}[k,k] - \text{TW}_k[i,k]$ beyond $\delta_i/(N-1)$

    $\to$ $v-v_i\leq \delta_i$ is ensured
