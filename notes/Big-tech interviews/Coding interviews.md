1. Overview process:
    - Apply to Camera team
    - Coding ~> Select candidate
    - 5 interviews:
        - stage 1: phone interview (qualification) - coding interviews
            - Answer Li
        - stage 2: virtual onsite (4 interviews of 45 mins)
            - 3 coding
            - 1 behavior
        - Format:
            - 1 SWE share a GG doc with me or a LINE coding platform
            - 45 mins long
            - 2 coding questions
            - Start: Introduce myself + relax
            - Coding: Ask quests to clarify + propose solution + write
            - Difficulty level:

                - Usually 2 medium-levels (45 mins)
                - Some prepares hard-level (1 quest only during 45 mins)
                - Try to be consistent (it can be any coding topic)
            - During the interview, I need to check the code, the SWE will look at the code and hint as well
                - Usually they will not
            - Try not to make mistakes, I can search for syntax if my interviewer allows
                - It should be fine

From Lam:
- Short intro is better (1 2 mins)
- Dry run (chac chan phai test code, test special cases)
    - Prefer short inputs
- Questioning about the input (limits)
- Moi lan co sol thi phai propose complexity
- Propose format of solve() function
- Find middle node of list using 1 vong for
- Khi nao bao code thi moi duoc code
- Giai thich sol ngan (vi luc code cung giai thich)
- Self intro + Sol intro (short) to spend time on coding
- Luon communicate (ke ca khi stucking)
- Khong duoc bo hint (Take his hint to praise him)

From Nhat:
- Take care of naming convention (naming by purposes)
- Ton thoi gian phan tich luc dau
- Khong can analyze time complexity (neu interviewer ko hoi, vi sau khi code thi interviewer se hoi lai)
    - Use different symbols: n, k, m, etc.
- Neu co thoi gian thi phan tich them examples (including edge cases)
- Cau hoi cho interviewer: 
    - Ko trong tam vao interview
    - Hoi ve working style, culture, etc.
- Judgement: How Google evaluate my performance?
- Behavioral question: Prepare questions for this task
- Some interviewers prepare backup question if the time is excessive
- Xuong dong sau moi lenh if-else
- 100 hard-level problems, cover all topics, etc.

From Quynh:
- Bi lac de
- Bai 1 expect 15 phut dau tien
- Can phai hoi de bai that la clear
- Code phai de y, khong duoc bug
- Co gang code de sua it cho nhat co the
- Cac phan rau ria (ko quan trong) thi co the assume la co ham nay
- Luyen them style code binary search
- Mat 5 phut de clear de bai
- Thuong cau 2 la follow up cua cau 1
