From Chau:
what I think you should do:
1. Have a spreadsheet and list your past projects. 
    1a. For each project, list your role, responsibilities, challenges
    1b. For each project, list any non-technical challenges. How you solved them.
2. Go through Amazon's leadership principle questions
3. Quickly glance through your spreadsheet and pick a project. Talk about it in STAR style
4. Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?
5. I always want to my a candidate's interests and goals towards projects in my team
