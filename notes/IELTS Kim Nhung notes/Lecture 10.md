            * Among those employed full-time, men on average had 50 hours of leisure, whereas women had approximately 37 hours. There were no figures given for male part-time workers, but female part-timers had 40 hours of leisure time, only slightly more than women in full-time employment, which reflects their work at home.
            * In the unemployed and retired groups, leisure time showed an increase for both sexes, as expected. Here too, men enjoyed more leisure time - over 80 hours compared to 70 hours of women, perhaps reflecting the fact that women spend more time working at home than men
