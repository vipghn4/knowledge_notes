    The flow chart demonstrates the procedure of recycling glass bottles, which consists of three stages. 
    
    As illustrated, the recycling stages are composed of over ten steps in total, starting with the customers bringing their used bottles to the collecting point, and ending with the filled-and-packaged bottles available at supermarkets. 

    In the first stage, as given in the diagram, customers will take their used bottles to some collecting point so that these bottles can be easily gathered for cleaning and classification. At this step, which is the very first step of stage two, the bottles will be cleaned with high-pressurised water and then will be graded into groups of green, brown, or clear bottles for cleaning plant. The cleaned bottles will then be trasmitted to glass factory, where they are crashed into pieces and melted into liquid. This kind of liquid will be added into a glass mould, and new bottles are eventually produced. These newly created bottles will be filled and packaged and finally exhibited at supermarkets for sale.
