    In 1780, the populated area covered a small area with only 100 homes occupying the Northeast of the region. There was a large expanses of woods (wood) in the South of the village and farmland next to the river, which runs from north to south in the west of the area.

    By 1860, the number of homes had doubled to 200 while the size of farmland and woods was reduced by half. A new bridge had been built over the river and a road had been constructed, linking the river to the residential area.

    140 years later, the number of households increased significantly to 500. In the south, farms and woods were replaced by sports fields and new schools, with a newly built road connecting the residences with the facilities. Some shops were opened along the riverbank, and a stretch of wetland for birds was established in the south near the river
