Describe a situation where you were surprised to meet a friend
* Who you met
    * It was a time where I have chance to meet my supervisor, a researcher from Stuttgart university in German. He is a well-known researcher working on robotics and artificial intelligence, and he has guided me towards towards field of AI for roughly 2 years, by the time we met. 
* Where it was
    * The meeting happened as he decide to come back to Vietnam, leaving his academic career behind, to educate young people in Vietnam about AI, a crucial part of the forth industrial revolution. He came back without informing me and surprisingly inform me as he come to Hanoi to attend a technical event.

    * I was so surprised that he left Germany and postpone his rising research career in order to come back and contribute to Vietnamese' students development. I was so glad that it was the first time I have a chance to talk to him, face to face, discussing about technical concepts, life stories, etc.
* How you feel about it
