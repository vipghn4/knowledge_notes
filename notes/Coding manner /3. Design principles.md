# Design principles
**Motivation**. Good software systems begin with clean code
* *Explain*.
    * If the bricks are not well made

        $\to$ The architecture of building does not matter much
    * We can make a substantial mess with well-made bricks
* *Solution*. Use SOLID principles

**SOLID principles**. Tell use how to arrange our functions and data structures into classes, and how those classes should be interconnected

>**NOTE**. "Class" here is not for only OO, but it is a coupled grouping of functions and data

* *Goal*. The creation of mid-level software structures that
    * Tolerate change
    * Easy to understand
    * The basis of components can be used in many software systems

    >**NOTE**. "Mid-level" means that these principles are applied by programmers working at the module level

>**NOTE**. It is possible to create a system-wide mess with well-designed mid-level components
>$\to$ Once we have covered the SOLID principles, we will move on to their counterparts in the component world, and then to principles of high-level architecture

* *Summary of SOLID principles*.
    * *SRP*. The single responsibility principle
        * *Conway's law*. The best structure for a software system is heavily influenced by the social structure of the organization using it
        * *Consequence*. Each software module has one, and only one, reason to change
    * *OCP*. The open-closed principle
        * *Bertrand Meyer's*. For software systems to be easy to change

            $\to$ They must be designed to allow the behavior of those systems to be changed by adding new code, rather than changing existing code
    * *LSP*. The Liskov substitution principle
        * *Content*. To build software systems from interchangable parts

            $\to$ Those parts must adhere to a contract allowing those parts to be substituted one for another
    * *ISP*. The interface segration principle
        * *Content*. Software designers should avoid depending on things that they do not use
    * *DIP*. The dependency inversion principle
        * *Content*. The code implementing high-level policy should not depend on low-level details

            $\to$ Details should depend on policies instead

## The single responsibility principle
**Definition**.
* *Historical definition*. A module should have one, and only one, reason to change
    * *Explain*. Software systems are changed to satisfy users and stakeholders

        $\to$ Those users and stakeholders are *reason to change* that the principle is talking about
    * *Rephrased definition*. A module should be responsible to one, and only one, user or stakeholder

    >**NOTE**. There will be likely more than one user or stakeholder who wants the system changed in the same way
    >$\to$ We should refer to a group of users and stakeholders, rather than individual ones
    * *Actor*. A group of users and stakeholders who want the system changed in the same way
* *Final definition*. A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor
    * *Definition of a module*. A source file (simplest, and works fine most of the time), or a cohesive set of functions and data structures
    * *Cohesion*. The force that binds together the code responsible to a single actor

### Violations of SRP
**Symptom 1**. Accidental duplication

* *Example*. The three methods in `Employee` are responsible to three very different actors

    <div style="text-align:center">

        <figcaption>Accidental duplication</figcaption>
    </div>

    * *Explain*.
        * `calculatePay()` is specified by the accounting department, which reports to the CFO
        * `reportHours()` is specified and used by the HR department, which reports to the COO
        * `save()` method is specified by the database administrator (DBAs), who reports to the CTO
    * *Consequence*. The actors are coupled to each other

        $\to$ The actions of the CFO's team may affect something related to the COO's team
* *Conclusion*. We should separate the code the different actors depend on

**Symptom 2**. Merges
* *Example*. If a source file contain many different methods

    $\to$ It is likely that those methods are responsible to different actors
    * *Consequecne*. Two different developers, possibly from different teams, checkout the source file and begin to make changes

        $\to$ If their changes collide, the result will be a merge
* *Conclusion*. We should separate codes that support different actors

**Solutions**. Move the functions into different classes
* *Most obvious approach*. Separate data from the functions
    * *Explain*.
        * The classes above share access to `EmployeeData`, which is a simple data structure with no methods
        * Each class holds only the source code necessary for its particular function
        * The classes are not allowed to know about each other
    * *Benefits*. Any accidental duplication is avoided
    * *Drawbacks*. Developers have three classes which they have to instantiate and track
* *Facade pattern*. Fix the drawback of the naive approach

    <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="/media/Zvkt2EV.png">
        <figcaption>Facade pattern</figcaption>
    </div>

    * *Idea*. Keep the most important business rules closer to the data
    * *Explain*.
        * Keep the most important method in the original `Employee` class
        * The `Employee` class can be used as a facade for the lesser functions

## The open-closed principle
**Definition**.
* *Historical definition*. A software artifact should be open for extension but closed for modification
    * *Explain*. The behavior of a software artifact ought to be extendible, wihout having to modify that artifact

### A thought experiment
**Reducing the amount of changed code to the barest minimum**. 
1. Properly separating things which change for different reasons (SRP)
2. Organize the dependencies between those things properly (DIP)

**Extending the behavior without modification**. Partition the processes into classes, then separate those classes into components
* *Example*. Seperate the classes into components: controller, interactor, database, presenters, and views

    $\to$ We then exploit interfaces and data structures

**Hierarchy of protection based on level**. If component A should be protected from changes in component B, then component B should depend on component A

$\to$ This creates a hierarchy of protection based on the notion 
* *Explain*. 
    * The most protected components are those who do not depend on any other
    * The least protected components are those who is the end-point of the data flow

>**NOTE**. This is how the OCP works at architectural level
>* *Explain*. 
>   1. Architects separate functionality based on how, why, and when it changes
>   2. Architects organize that separated functionality into a hierarchy of components

**Directional control**. Much of the complexity in a UML diagram was intended to make sure that dependencies between components pointed in the correct direction

**Information hiding**. Software entities should not depend on things they do not directly use

## Liskov substitution principle
**Definition**. If for each object $o_1$ of type $S$, there is an object $o_2$ of type $T$ such that, for all programs $P$ defined in terms of $T$, the behavior of $P$ is unchanged when $o_1$ is subsituted for $o_2$

$\to$ $S$ is a subtype of $T$

**LSP and architecture**. In the early years of the OO revolution, we thought of the LSP as a way to guide the use of inheritance

$\to$ Over years, the LSP has morphed into a broader principle of software design that pertains to interfaces and implementations
* *Why LSP*. There are users who depend on well-defined interfaces, and on the substitutability of the implementations of the interfaces

**Example of LSP violation**. When some of the derived classes of a base class need special treatment, which is different than other derived classes

## The interface segregation principle
**Definition**. There are several users who use operations of the `OPS` class, each of them use only one method of the class

$\to$ The source code of user 1 will inadvertently depend on `op2` and `op3`, even though it does not call them

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/media/U1cNFLw.png">
    <figcaption>The ISP</figcaption>
</div>

* *Consequence*. A change to the source code of `op2` and `op3` in `OPS` will force user 1 to recompiled and redeployed, even though nothing that it cared about has actually changed
* *Solution*. Segragate the operations into interfaces

    <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="/media/mexf4Iq.png">
        <figcaption>Segregated operations</figcaption>
    </div>

**ISP and architecture**. It is harmful to depend on modules that contain more than we need

$\to$ This is obviously true for source code dependencies that can force unncessary recompilation and redeployment
* *ISP at architecture level*. Consider the following case
    * *Assumptions*.
        * An architect working on a system $S$ and he wants to include a certain framework $F$ into the system
        * Frameowkr $F$ is bounded to a particular database $D$
            
            $\to$ $S$ depends on $F$, which depends on $D$
    * *Case*. If $D$ contains features that $F$ does not use, and thus $S$ does not care about

        $\to$ Changes to $D$ may well force the redeployment of $F$, and, therefore, the redeployment of $S$

## The dependency inversion principle
**Definition**. The most flexible systems are those in which source code dependencies refer only to abstractions, not to concretions

>**NOTE**. Treating this idea as a rule is unrealistic, since software systems must depend on mnay concrete facilities
>$\to$ We tend to ignore the stable background of OS and platform facilities when it comes to DIP

>**NOTE**. We can tolerate concrete dependencies if we know we can rely on them not to change

>**NOTE**. We do not want to depend on concrete elements, which are modules that we are actively developing, and that are undergoing frequent change

### Stable abstraction
**Problem**. Every change to an abstract interface corresponds to a change to its concrete implementations

$\to$ Interfaces are less volatile than implementations
* *Consequence*. Good software designers and architects work hard to reduce the volatility of interfaces
    * *Explain*. They try to find ways to add functionality to implementations, without making changes to the interfaces

        $\to$ Stable software architectures are those that avoid depending on volatile concretions, and that favor the use of stable abstract interfaces

**Coding practices**.
* *Do not refer to volatile concrete classes*. Refer the abstract interfaces instead

    $\to$ This puts severe constraints on the creation of objects, and generally enforces the use of abstract factories
* *Do not derive from volatile concrete classes*
* *Do not override concrete functions*. Concrete functions often require source code depenedncies

    $\to$ When overriding them, we do not eliminate those dependencies, but we inherit them
    * *Solution*. Make the function abstract and create multiple implementations
* *Never mention the name of anything concrete and volatile
