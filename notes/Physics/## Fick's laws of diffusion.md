## Fick's laws of diffusion
**Fick's laws of diffusion**. Describe diffusion and be used to solve for the diffusion coefficient $D$
* *Fickian diffusion*. A diffusion obeying Fick's laws

**First law**. Relate the diffuse flux to the gradient of concentration
* *Postulation*. The flux goes from the regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration, with a magnitude proportional to the concentration gradient, i.e. spatial derivative
* *1D spatial version*.
    * *Assumptions*.
        * $J$ is the diffusion flux measuring the amount of substance flowing through a unit area, during a unit time interval
            * *Dimension*. Amount of substance per unit area per unit time
        * $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, or diffusity
            * *Dimension*. Area per unit time
        * $\phi$ is the concentration, for ideal mixtures
            * *Dimension*. Amount of substance per unit volume
        * $x$ is the position
            * *Dimension*. Length
    * *Conclusion*. $J = -D \frac{d\phi}{dx}$
    * *$D$'s dependencies*. $D$ is proportional to the squared velocity of the diffusing particles, which depends on the temperature
* *n-D spatial version*. $\mathbf{J} = -D\nabla \phi$
