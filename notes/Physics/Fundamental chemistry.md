* *The impossibility of drawing orbits for electrons*. To plot a path for something we need to know exactly where it is
    
    $\to$ We cannot do this for electrons
* *Heisenberg uncertainty principle*. We cannot know with certainty both where an electron is, and where it is going next
* *Orbital*.
    * *Experiments*. Consider a single hydrogen atom
        * At a particular instant plotted the position of one electron
        * Soon afterwards, we do the same thing, and find that it is in a new position

            $\to$ We have no idea how it got from the first place to the second
        * We keep doing the experiment to gradually build up a sort of 3D map of the places, which the electron is likely to be found
    * *Orbital*. 95% of the time, the electron will be found within a fairly easily defined region of space quite close to the nucleus, i.e. an orbital

        $\to$ We can think of orbital as the region of space, in which the electron lives
    * *Electron operation in orbital*. Nobody knows
* *Orbital naming*. Each orbital naming has a name, e.g. 1s, 2s, 2p, etc.
    * *Energy level*. The numerical prefix of orbital name, e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc.
    * *Orbital shape*. The suffix of the orbital name, e.g. s, p, d, etc.
        * *Common shapes*.
            * `s` means spherical shape
            * `p` means two identical balloons tied together at the nucleus
* *Fitting electrons into orbitals*. An atom is a very strange house, with the nucleus living on the ground floor, then various rooms, i.e. orbitals, on the higher floors occupied by the electrons
    * *Maximum number of electrons per orbital*. 2, i.e. the room are not very big

        $\to$ A convenient way of showing the orbitals, where the electrons live, is to draw electrons in boxes
    * *Electrons in boxes*. Orbitals can be represented as boxes with the electrons in them shown as arrows

**Electron shell**. An orbit followed by electrons around an atom's nucleus
* *Electron shells*. Each shell can only contain a fixed number of electrons, i.e. the $n$th shell, in principle, can hold up to $2n^2$ electrons
    * *Subshells*. Each shell consists of one or more subshells, each of which consists of one or more atomic orbitals
* *Subshells*. 
    * *Example*. 
        * The first (K) shell has one subshell, i.e. 1s
        * The second (L) shell has two subshells, i.e. 2s and 2p
        * The third shell has 3s, 3p, and 3d
        * The fourth shell has 4s, 4p, 4d, and 4f
        * The fifth shell has 5s, 5p, 5d, 5f, and theoretically 5g
    * *Subshell label and maximum number of electrons*.

        | Subshell label | $l$ | Max electrons |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | s | 0 | 2 |
        | p | 1 | 6 |
        | d | 2 | 10 |
        | f | 3 | 14 |
        | g | 4 | 18 |

* *Energy level*. Fixed distances from the nucleus of an atom, where electrons may be found
    * *Energy level and shell*. Energy level is a more correct term, the term "shell" is just used to make them easier to understand
    * *Bound electrons*. Electrons which cannot leave their orbits and roam free

        $\to$ This is because the electric force keeps them in their orbit
        * *Consequence*. For them to escape from this bond, it must be given some energy

            $\to$ When sufficient energy is given to the electron, it will come out of the orbit and will be free to move around, i.e. free electrons
    * *Freeing an electron*. Use a high external voltage
* *Subshell energies and filling order*. Electrons in a shell approximately have the same energy
    * *Explain*. The electrons in one subshell do have exactly the same level of energy, with later subshells having more energy per electron than earlier ones
    * *Shell filling*. The filling of shells and subshells with electrons proceeds form subshells of lower energy to subshells of higher energy
        * *Madelung rule*. 
            * Subshells with a lower $n+l$ value are filled before those with higher $n+l$ values
            * In case of equal $n+l$ values, the subshell with a lower $n$ value is filled first

**Electron configuration**. The distribution of electrons of an atom or molecule in atomic or molecular orbitals
* *Idea*. Each electron moves independently in an orbital, in an average field created by all other orbitals
* *Open and closed shells*.
    * *Open shell*. A valance shell, which is not completely filled with electrons, or has not given all of its valance electrons through chemical bonds with other atoms or molecules during a chemical reaction
    * *Closed shell*. Obtained with a completely filled valance shell

        $\to$ This configuration is very stable

**Chemical stability**. Unreactivity, i.e. the most unreactive elements are those least willing to give up, or gain, an electron
* *Stability of closed shells*. Closed shells are more stable since they have the highest ionization energy in their periods
    * *Ionization energy (IE)*. The minimum energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron of an isolated neutral gasesous atom or molecule, i.e.

        $$X(g) + \text{energy} \to X^+(g) + e^-$$

        where $X$ is any atom or molecule and $e^-$ is the removed electron
* *Why atom gains electrons for stability*.
    * *Definition of stability*. The lower potential energy, i.e. the closer the electrons are to the nucleus, the more stable electron configuration it is
        * *Explain*. If the distance between the nucleus and electron decreases, the electrostatic attraction force increases, making the electron more stable

            $\to$ This makes the electron less likely to move to another spot, i.e. more stable
    * *Adding electrons to an atom*. Orbitals with the same amount of energy, e.g. Px, Py, Pz, have the same distance from the nucleus
        * *Adding electrons to an unfilled shell* When we add more electrons to a shell, the amount of charge increases, but the distance remains the same, increasing the attraction force
            * *Consequence*. The attraction force will increase and reach the maximum when it is filled
        * *Adding electrons to a filled shell*. There is no place in the shell, thus the electron will have to go to the next shell

            $\to$ The distance increases, resulting in no stability increment
    * *Giving up electrons*. Electron in the inner shells shields the outer shell electrons from the influence of the nucleus, decreasing the attraction force
        * *Consequence*. If there are only a few electrons in the outermost shell

            $\to$ It is not attracted by the nucleus that much, getting easily donated

### Molecules
**Chemical bond**. A lasting attraction between atoms, ions, or molecules, which enables the formation of chemical compounds
* *Types of bond*. 
    * *Ionic bond*. Electrostatic force of attraction between oppositely charged ions
    * *Covalent bond*. The sharing of electrons between atoms

**Covalent bond**. A chemical bond involving the sharing of electron pairs, i.e. bonding pairs or shared pairs, between atoms

</div>

* *Covalent bonding*. The stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons
* *Purposes*. Sharing electrons allows each atom to attain the equivalent of a full valence shell, corresponding to a stable electronic configuration

## Conductor
**Conductor**. Substances allowing free electrons to flow through them easily

$\to$ Energy is transferred in the form of electricity as electrons move freely from atom to atom
* *How conductor works*. For a good conductor, the electricity passed through it must be able to move the electrons, i.e. the more electrons in a metal, the greater its conductivity 
    * If we send an electrically charged electron into a conductor

        $\to$ It hits a free electron, eventually knocking it off until it knocks off other free electrons
    * This triggers sort of chain reaction creating electrical charge through the material
* *Valence electrons*. The electrons in the last orbit also determines mainly the electrical properties of the elements known as valence electrons
    * *Conductor and valence electrons*. If we observe the electronic configuration of any metal element, we will find that it has less than 4 electrons in its outermost shell
        * *Example*. Aluminium has 3 valence electrons, magnesium has 2, and the copper has 1
    * *Semiconductor and valence electrons*. When the number of valence electrons is 4, the properties of such elements and materials are in between metallic and non-metallic

        $\to$ The elements or materials cannot conduct electric current as efficiently as a conductor
    * *Insulator*. When the number of valence electrons is more than 4, the element behaves as non-metal, i.e. bad conductor
* *Free electron*. Electron of the outmost shell of any atom, which can move freely as the atom is exerted by an external force, e.g. electric field

**Electric field inside a conductor**.
* *Scenario*. Assume that a conductor is kept in an external uniform electric field $E$
* *Moving direction of charge*.
    * Negative charge move in the direction opposite to the direction of the electric field
    * Positive charge move in the direction of the electric field
* *Conductor structure*. A conduct has a lot of mobile or free electrons
    * *Formation of inner electric field*. 
        * When keep the conductor in an external electric field, electrons will experience a force in the direction opposite to the direction of $E$

            $\to$ Electrons will start accumulating at surface $A$ of the conductor
        * The positive charge will then start building at the opposite face $B$ of the conductor

            $\to$ This leads to the development of electric field $E'$ within the conductor
    * *Direction of $E'$*. Opposite to $E$
    * *Evolution of $E'$*. As the accumulation of electrons increases on face $A$, The strength of $E'$ will also increases strongly
* *Equilibrium*. As soon as the strength of $E'$ equals to the strength of $E$, no net electric field will be inside the conductor to drive the electrons

    $\to$ Further accumulation of electrons will stop
    * *Consequence*. At equilibrium, the strength of electric field inside the conductor is zero
