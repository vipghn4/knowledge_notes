# The horse race
## Odds and payoff
**$o_i$ for $1$ payoff**: an investment of $1$ dollar on horse $i$ results in 
* $o_i$ dollars if horse $i$ wins
* $0$ dollars otherwise

**Ways of describing odds**:
* $a$-for-$1$:
    * The gambler puts down $1$ dollar before the race
    * The gambler receives $a$ dollars after the race if his horse wins, and $0$ dollars otherwise
* $b$-to-$1$: the gambler pays $1$ dollar after the race if his horse loses and picks up $b$ dollars otherwise

>**NOTE**: $(a - 1)$-to-$1$ is equivalent to $a$-for-$1$
* Explain: both gain $a-1$ dollars if the chosen horse wins and lose $1$ dollar otherwise

## Game rule - fully invested case
**Fully invested case**: the gambler distributes all of his wealth across the horses

**Assumptions on the game**:
* $m$ is the number of horses
* Horse $i$ wins with probability $p_i$
* If horse $i$ wins, the payoff is $o_i$-for-$1$

**Assumptions on the gambler**:
* $b_i$ is the fraction of gambler's wealth invested in horse $i$
    * $b_i \geq 0$ $\forall i$
    * $\sum_i b_i = 1$ 
* If horse $i$ wins, 
    * The gambler receives $o_i b_i$ of his previous wealth
    * All the other best are lost

    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ The gambler will have multiplied his wealth by $b_i o_i$
* The gambler can reinvest his money on other races
    * $S(X) = b_X o_X$ is the facter by which the gambler's money is multiplied when horse $X$ wins
    * $S_n$ is the gambler's money after $n$ races
  
  $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow S_n = \prod_{i = 1}^n S(X_i)$

**Task**: maximize the gambler's wealth at the end of a race
* Observations: betting everything on the horse with the maximum $p_i o_i$ is clearly risky

## Fully invested case
**Wealth relative**: $S_X = b_X o_X$
* Intuition: the factor by which the gambler's wealth grows if horse $X$ wins the race

**Doubling rate of a horse race**: $W(\textbf{b}, \textbf{p}) = E(\log S_X) = \sum_{k = 1}^m p_k \log(b_k o_k)$
* Intuition: after each bet, $\log W$, where $W$ is the initial wealth of the gambler, will increases by $E(\log S_X)$

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ To achieve $\log (2W)$, the gambler has to bet on $\frac{\log 2}{E(\log S_X)} = \frac{1}{W(\textbf{b}, \textbf{p})}$ races

**Theorem**:
* Assumptions:
  * The race outcomes $X_1, X_2, ...$ are i.i.d
  * $X_i \sim p(x)$
* Conclusion: $S_n \to 2^{n W(\textbf{b}, \textbf{p})}$ (in probability)
    * Another interpretation: $\frac{1}{n} \log S_n = W(\textbf{b}, \textbf{p})$ 
* Prove: direct prove using law of large numbers
* Consequence: $S_n$ grows exponentially at rate $W(\textbf{b}, \textbf{p})$
    * Explain: if the gambler has his doubling rate $W(\textbf{b}, \textbf{p}) + c$ (i.e. increased by $c$), then $S_n$ must increase to $2^{nc} S_n$ 

**The optimum doubling rate $W^*(\textbf{p})$**: $W^*(\textbf{p}) = \max_{b_i \geq 0 \\ \sum_i b_i = 1} W(\textbf{b}, \textbf{p})$
* Proportional gambling is log-optimal: $W^*(\textbf{p}) = \sum_{i=1}^m p_i \log o_i - H(\textbf{p})$ at $\textbf{b}^* = \textbf{p}$
    * Prove: direct prove
* Intuition:
    * $b_X$ expresses the gambler's belief on how likely horse $X$ wins the race
        * Gambler's estimation on $P(\text{hourse } X \text{ wins})$: $P_G(X) \propto b_X$

        $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ To increase $W(\textbf{b}, \textbf{p})$, $P_G$ must be closer to $\textbf{p}$ in terms of cross entropy
    * $o_X$ expresses the bookie's belief on how likely horse $X$ wins the race
        * Bookie's estimation on $P(\text{hourse } X \text{ wins})$: $P_B(X) \propto \frac{1}{o_X}$

        $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ To decrease $W(\textbf{b}, \textbf{p})$, $P_B$ must be closer to $\textbf{p}$ in terms of cross entropy

**Proportional gambling scheme (Kelly gambling scheme)**: $\textbf{b}^* = \textbf{p}$
* Explain: the gambler bets on each horse in proportion to its probability of winning

### Special cases
**Fair odds case**:
* Assumptions:
    * $\sum_{i=1}^m \frac{1}{o_i} = 1$
    * $r_i = \frac{1}{o_i}$ is the bookie's estimate on the p.m.f over the horses
* Observations: $W(\textbf{b}, \textbf{p}) = D(\textbf{p}\|\textbf{r}) - D(\textbf{p}\|\textbf{b})$
* Conclusion: $W(\textbf{b}, \textbf{p})$ is the difference between bookie's estimation error and gambler estimation's error

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ The gambler can make money only if $\textbf{b}$ is better than $\textbf{r}$

**Uniform fair odds**:
* Assumptions:
    * $r_i = \frac{1}{o_i} = \frac{1}{m}$ $\forall i$
* Conclusion: $W^*(\textbf{p}) = \log m - H(\textbf{p})$

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow W^*(\textbf{p}) + H(\textbf{p}) = \log m$
* Corollary: every bit of entropy decrease doubles rate of the gambler's wealth

## General case
**Assumptions**:
* $b_0$ is the proportion of wealth held out as cash
* $b_i$ is the proportions bet on the various horses for $i \in [1, m]$

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ At the end of a race, the ratio of final wealth to initial wealth is $S_X = b_0 + b_X o_X$

### Optimal strategy
**Superfair odds**: $\sum_i \frac{1}{o_i} < 1$
* Worst case of $\textbf{o}$: $W^*(\textbf{p}) > 0$
* Intuition: $\frac{1}{o_i}$ can be understood as the proportion of the wealth bet on horse $i$ and winning money

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ If $\sum_i \frac{1}{o_i} < 1$ then the money bookie has to spend is larger than the money the gambler spends (if he bet on all horses uniformly)

>**NOTE**: betting on all horse uniformly means that the gambler has no information about $\textbf{p}$, and thus $W(\textbf{b}, \textbf{p})$ is minimized

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ In this case, even when $W(\textbf{b}, \textbf{p})$ is minimized, the gambler is still earn more money than the bookie, and thus this scheme is the best

* Optimal strategy: proportional gambling
    * Explain: the gambler always wins no matter which horse wins
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ He should always spend all of his wealth (i.e. $\sum_i b_i = 1$), thus proportional gambling is optimal

**Fair odds w.r.t some distribution**: $\sum_i \frac{1}{o_i} = 1$
* Worst case of $\textbf{o}$: $W^*(\textbf{p}) = 0$
* Intuition: the money bookie has to spend equals to than the money the gambler spends (if he bet on all horses uniformly)
* Optimal strategy: proportional gambling
    * Explain: if the gambler want to keep $c$ as his withholding cash, he can first bet $c \frac{1}{o_i}$ on each horse $i$ then use the remaining cash to bet
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow \sum_i b_i = 1$, which indicates that the gambler should apply proportional gambling

**Subfair odds**: $\sum_i \frac{1}{o_i} > 1$
* Worst case of $\textbf{o}$: $W^*(\textbf{p}) < 0$
* Intuition: the money bookie has to spend is smaller than the money the gambler spends (if he bet on all horses uniformly)
* Optimal strategy: solve duality problem based on KKT conditions
    * Explain: since the gambler may lose some of his wealth
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ He may not want to use proportional gambling, which may cause his wealth decreases by $p_i \log (b_i o_i)$ (in terms of doubling rate), where $o_i < 1$

# Gambling and side information
**Problem**: if the gambler has some information that is relevant to the outcome of the gambler

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ What is the financial value of this side information
* Financial value of side information: the wealth that results from the information

**Measure of the value of side information**: the increase in doubling rate due to the information

**Assumptions**:
* General:
    * $X \in \{1, ..., m\}$ are horses 
        * Horse $X$ wins with probability $p(x)$
    * The odds are $o(x)$-for-$1$
    * $(X, Y)$ have joint probability mass function $p(x, y)$
* Side-information-based betting strategy:
    * $b(x|y) \geq 0$ and $\sum_x b(x|y) = 1$
        * $b(x|y)$ is the proportion of wealth bet on horse $x$ given $Y = y$
    * $b(x) \geq 0$ and $\sum b(x) = 1$ is the unconditional betting scheme
* Optimal doubling rates:
    * $W^*(X) = \max_{\textbf{b}(x)} \sum_x p(x) \log [b(x) o(x)]$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ Wealth grows like $2^{n W^*(X)}$ without side information
    * $W^*(X|Y) = \max_{\textbf{b}(x|y)} \sum_{x, y} p(x, y) \log [b(x|y) o(x)]$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ Wealth grows like $2^{n W^*(X|Y)}$ with side information

**Increase in doubling rate due to side information $Y$**: $\Delta W = W^*(X|Y) - W^*(X) = I(X; Y)$
* Intuition:
    * Assume that the gambler spends $\beta$ (as a proportion of his wealth) on the bet
    * Knowing $Y$ or not only changes the way the gambler estimates $\textbf{p}$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ The goodness of the gambler's estimation is changed from $H[\textbf{p}(X)]$ to $H[\textbf{p}(X|Y)]$ (since we only consider the optimal doubling rate $W^*$)

## Dependent horse races and entropy rate
**Most common example of side information for a horse race**: the past performance of the horses (in case of dependent horse races)

**The doubling rate for uniform fair odds**:
* Assumptions:
    * $\{X_k\}$ is the sequence of horse race outcomes, which forms a stochastic process
* The doubling rate for uniform fair odds: $W^*(X_k|X_{k-1}, ..., X_1)$
    * Formula: $W^*(X_k|X_{k-1}, ..., X_1) = E\{\max_{\textbf{b}(\cdot|X_{k-1}, ..., X_1)} E[\log S(X_k)|X_{k-1}, ..., X_1]\}$ 
    
    $\hspace{5.35cm} = \log m - H(X_k|X_{k-1}, ..., X_1)$
* Optimal betting scheme: $b^*(x_k|x_{k-1}, ..., x_1) = p(x_k|x_{k-1}, ..., x_1)$

# The entropy of English
## Introduction
**Problem**: propose stochastic approximations to English, which probably not a stationary ergodic process

**Application**:
* Generate text that looks like English (by increasing the complexity of the appoximation model)
* Compress English text (i.e. the better the stochastic approxiation, the better the compression)

**Assumptions**: the alphabet of English consists of $26$ letters and the space symbol

## Stochastic approximation of English
**Build more complex models**: 
* Higher-order Markov approximation: we can use the frequency of the tuples to estimate the probability that a letter follows other letters

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ Proceeding this way, we can build more complex modules for the language
* Issue of higher order approximation: the amount of data must be enough
  * Example: to build a third-order Markov approximation, we must estimate $p(x_i|x_{i-1}, x_{i-2}, x_{i-3})$
  
  $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ There are $27^4$ cases of $p(x_i|x_{i-1}, x_{i-2}, x_{i-3})$ needed to estimate, hence the required amount of data to make accurate estimates is very large

## Applications
**Generate random samples of letters**:
* Idea: draw samples of letters from the estimated distributions
* Result: the approximations get closer and closer to resembling English, as the model complexity increases

**Decode encrypted English text (or speech or images)**
