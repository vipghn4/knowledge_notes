# Probability and statisitcal model
**Statistical model**: 
* Definition: a statistical model consist of
    * An identification of random variables $X_1, X_2, ...$ of interest (both observable and hypothetically observable)
    * A specification of a joint distribution $f$, or a family of joint distributions for the observable random variables
    * The identification of parameters $\theta$ of the distributions
        * Note: the parameters are unknown and possibly hypothetically observable
    * A specification for a (joint) distribution $g$ for the unknown parameters (if desired)

    >**NOTE**: when we treat $\theta$ as random, $f(X|\theta)$ is the conditional joint distribution of $X_1, X_2, ...$ given $\theta$

**Statistical inference**: a procedure which produces a probabilistic statement about some or all parts of a statistical model
* Probabilistic statement: statements which amke use of any of the concepts of probability theory

## General classes of inference problems
**Prediction**: predict unseen random variables
* Estimation: predict a parameter (not a random variable)

**Statistical decision problems**: choose a decision from some available class of decisions depending on the unknown value of some parameter

**Experimental design**: choose the particular experiment which is to be carried out
* Experimental design and statistical inference: 
    * One cannot design an effective experiment without considering subsequent statistical analysis
    * One cannot carry out a meaningful statistical analysis of experimental data without considering the particular type of experiment, from which the data were derived

**Other inferences**

## Definition of a statistic
**Statistic**: a real-valued function of the random variables
* Formal: $T = r(X_1, ..., X_n)$

**Tricks**: 
* Most inferences will involve the use of statistics which could by identified in advance
* Knowing which statistics are useful in which inferences can greatly simplify the implementation of the inference
