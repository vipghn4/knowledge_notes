In this chapter, we shall derive, for random samples from a normal distribution, the distribution of the sample variance and the distributions of various functions of the sample mean and the sample variance. 

These derivations will lead us to the definitions of some new distributions that play important roles in problems of statistical inference. 

In addition, we shall study certain general properties of estimators and their sampling distributions

# Sampling distribution of a statistic
**Sampling distribution**:
* Assumptions:
    * $\textbf{X} = (X_1, ..., X_n)$ form a random sample from a distribution indexed by some unknown $\theta$
    * $T = r(X_1, ..., X_n, \theta)$ is a statistic
* Sampling distribution of $T$: the distribution of $T$ given $\theta$
    * "sampling distribution": $T$ depends on a random sample and its distribution is derived from the sample distribution


**Usage**:
* Address questions like how close we expect $T$ to be to $\theta$ prior to observing the data
* Determine how much we will learn about $\theta$ by observing $T$
* Compare two estimators
* Used as an intermediate calculation of some procedure
* Decide which one of several experiments should be performed to obtain the best estimator of $\theta$
