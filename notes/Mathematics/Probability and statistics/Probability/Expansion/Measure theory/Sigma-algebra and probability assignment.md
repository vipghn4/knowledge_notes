# $\sigma$-algebra and probability assignment
## Algebra and $\sigma$-algebra
### $\sigma$-algebra
**Semi-ring of sets**. A collection of sets $F is a semiring if
* $\emptyset \in F$
* If $A,B\in F$ then $A\cap B\in F$, i.e. closed under intersection
* If $A,B\in F$ then there exists a collection of sets $C_1,\dots,C_n\in F$ so that

    $$A/B = \sum_{i=1}^n C_i$$

**Algebra of sets**. A subset of semi-ring
* *Algebra of sets*. A collection of sets $F$ is an algebra if
    * $\emptyset \in F$
    * If $A\in F$ then $A^C\in F$, i.e. closed under complementation
    * If $A,B\in F$ then $A\cup B\in F$, i.e. closed under pairwise


**$\sigma$-algebra (or $\sigma$-field)**.
* *Definition*. A class $\mathcal{A}$ satisfying
    * $\emptyset \in {\mathcal{A}}$
    * If $A_1, A_2, ... \in {\mathcal{A}}$ then $\bigcup_i A_i \in {\mathcal{A}}$
    * $A \in {\mathcal{A}}$ implies $A^c \in {\mathcal{A}}$
* *Motivation*.
    * *"$\sigma$"*. Indicate that the considered system of sets is closed with respect to the formation of denumerable unions
        * *Explain*. $\sigma$ [=Greek "s"] comes from the German words Summe, whose English translation is sum
    * *"Algebra"*. Closure under set operations
    * *From measure theory*. $\sigma$-algebra are closed under operations which one would expect for measurable sets
        * The complement of a measurable set is a measurable set
        * The countable union of measurable sets is a measurable set
* *Properties*.
    * $\Omega \in {\mathcal{F}}$
    * $A_1, A_2 \in {\mathcal{A}}$ implies $A_1 \cap A_2 \in {\mathcal{A}}$
        * *Explain*. $A_1 \cap A_2 =  [A_1^c \cup A_2^c]^c$
* *Applications*. The collections of subsets, for which a given measure is defined, is necessarily a $\sigma$-algebra
* *Relationship to algebra*. 
    * $\sigma$-algebra is a special case of algebra, which must be closed under countably infinite unions, rather than pairwise unions
        * *Explain*. Closure under pairwise union does not necessarily imply closure under countable union
    * Hence, we can treat algebra as surely being closure under finite union, and $\sigma$-algebra takes a further step by being closure under countable union

        $\to$ $\sigma$-algebra is required when dealing with more complicated systems, when closure under countable union is required
    * We sticks with countable since it is very expressive and easy to deal with
* *References*.

**$\sigma$-algebra generated by $F$**.
* *Assumptions*. Let $F$ be an arbitrary family of subsets of $X$
* *Conclusion*. There exists a unique smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing every set in $F$, even if $F$ may or may not itself be a $\sigma$-algebra

    $\to$ This is the intersection of all $\sigma$-algebras containing $F$, and is denoted as $\sigma(F)$
* *Sample space and event*. The collection of possible events $\Sigma$, given the sample space $\Omega$, is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\Omega$

**Borel $\sigma$-algebra**. The smallest $\sigma$-algebra holding every open set, i.e. the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the open sets

## Measure theory
### Measure and measurability
**A measure on a set**. A systematic way to assign a number to each suitable subset of the set
* *Formal*. 
    * *Assumptions*.
        * $f: X \to [0, \infty)\cup \{\infty\}$ is a function
        * ${\mathcal{X}}$ is where $f$ is defined on 
        * $X$ is the set of certain subsets of ${\mathcal{X}}$, which form a $\sigma$-algebra over $\mathcal{X}$
    * *Conclusion*. $f$ is a measure if the following holds
        * *Non-negativity*. $f(x) \geq 0$ $\forall x \in X$
        * *Null empty set*. $f(\emptyset) = 0$
        * *Countable additivity (or $\sigma$ additivity)*. For all countable collections $\{x_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ of pairwise disjoint sets in $X$

            $$f(\bigcup_k x_k) = \sum_k f(x_k)$$

* *Interpretation*. A measure on a set is assigning sizes to subsets of the set

**Outer measure**. A measure which exhibits monotonicity
* *Assumptions*. $X$ is a set with power set $\mathcal{P}(X)$
* *Outer measure on $X$*. A mapping $\mu:\mathcal{P}(X)\to\mathbb{R}_{++}\cup\{\infty\}$ satisfying
    * *Null empty set*. $\mu(\emptyset)=0$
    * *Monotonicity*. 
        
        $$\forall A,B\in\mathcal{P}(X):A\subseteq B\implies\mu(A)\leq \mu(B)$$
    
    * *Countable subadditivity*. For all sequences $\{A_i\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}\in\mathcal{P}(X)$

        $$\mu(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i)\leq \sum_{i=1}^\infty \mu(A_i)$$

**Measurability**. The sets in a $\sigma$-field ${\mathcal{A}}$ are measurable
* *Measurable sets*. Members of ${\mathcal{A}}$
* *Measurable space*. $(\Omega, {\mathcal{A}})$ is a measurable space
    * *Explain*. $\Omega$ and a $\sigma$-algebra defined on it
    * *Other notation*. $(\Omega, {\mathcal{A}}, f)$ where $f$ is the measure function
        * *Example*. probability space is a measurable space with a probability measure
* *Measurable map*. A random variable $X$ is a measurable map $X: \Omega \to \textbf{R}$
    * *Explain*. $\{\omega:X(\omega) \leq x\} \in {\mathcal{A}}$ $\forall x$

**Counting measure**. The counting measure of a set is the cardinity of that set

$\to$ All sets are measurable w.r.t the counting measure
* *Explain*. 
    * The finite sets have as measure the number of elements
    * The infinite sets have measure $\infty$

### Lebesgue measure
**Lebesgue measure**. A standard way of assigning a measure to subsets of $n$-dimensional Euclidean space

$\to$ For $n=1,2,3$, it coincides with length, area, and volume
* *Lebesgue measure*.
    * *Assumptions*.
        * $l(I)=b-a$ is the length of any interval $I=[a,b]$ or $I=(a,b)$ in $\mathbb{R}$
        * For any subset $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}$, $\{I_k\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of open intervals with

            $$E\in\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k$$

    * *Lebesgue outer measure of $E$*.

        $$\lambda^*(E)=\inf\{\sum_{k=1}^\infty l(I_k)\}$$

* *Lebesgue measure and $\sigma$-algebra*. Given a $\sigma$-algebra $\Sigma$, the Lebesgue measure of any $E\in\Sigma$ is defined as

    $$\lambda(E)=\lambda^*(E)$$

* *Lebesgue-measurable set*. A set which can be assigned a Lebesgue measure

**Null set**. A subset $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ is a null set if, for every $\epsilon>0$, $S$ can be covered with countably many products of $n$ intervals, whose total volume is at most $\epsilon$

$\to$ A null set represents the concept of zero measure
* *Countable set and null set*. Any countable set is a null set
    * *Proof*. 
        * Let $S=\{s_0,s_1,s_2,\dots\}$ be a countable set, and define the $n$th cover interval as

            $$I_n=[s_n-\frac{\epsilon}{2^{n+2}},s_n+\frac{\epsilon}{2^{n+2}}]$$
        
            where $l(I_n)=\frac{\epsilon}{2^{n+1}}$
        
        * The length of the entire cover interval is given as

            $$l(I)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty l(I_i) \approx \frac{\epsilon}{2}$$
        
        * Since $S\subset I$, we have that

            $$l(A)<l(I)<\epsilon$$
* *Uncountable set and null set*. An uncountable set may not be a null set, e.g. consider $I=[-1,1]=\bigcup_{x\in[-1,1]} \{x\}$

### Vitali set as an example of non-Lebesgue-measurable
**Axiom of choice**.
* *Choice function (or selector, or selection)*. A function $f$ defined on a collection $X$ of non-empty sets so that

    $$\forall A\in X,f(A)\in A$$

* *Axiom of choice*. For any set $X$ of non-empty sets, there exists a choice function $f$ defined on $X$, which maps each set $A\in X$ to an element of the set
* *Interpretation*. Given any collection of bins, each containing at least one object

    $\to$ It is possible to make a selection of exactly one object from each bin, even if the collection is infinite

**Vitali set**. A subset $V$ of the interval $[0,1]$ of real numbers so that for each $r\in\mathbb{R}$, there exists exactly one $v\in V$ so that $v-r\in\mathbb{Q}$

>**NOTE**. There are uncountably many Vitali sets

* *Construction of a Vitali set*.
    * *Equivalence relation*. Consider the relation

        $$x\sim y\Leftrightarrow x-y\in\mathbb{Q}$$
        
        $\to$ This relation partitions $\mathbb{R}$ into equivalence classes
    * *Equivalence class*. $a,b$ belong to the same equivalence class if and only if $a\sim b$
    * *Construction of Vitali set*. By the axion of choice, we can select a representative of each single class

        $\to$ The Vitali set $V$ is the set of all selected representatives
* *Measurability*. A Vitali set is an elementary example of set of real numbers, which is not Lebesgue-measurable, i.e.
    * Let $\mathbb{Q}_{[-1,1]}=\mathbb{Q}\cap[-1,1]=\{q_1,q_2,\dots\}$ and

        $$\forall k=1,2,\dots,V_k=V+q_k=\{v:v+q_k:v\in V\}$$
    
    * We have that $V_1,V_2,\dots$ are pairwise disjoint, and

        $$[0,1]\subseteq\bigcup_k V_k\subseteq[-1,2]$$

        hence

        $$1\leq \sum_{k=1}^\infty \lambda(V_k)\leq 3$$
    
    * Since $\lambda(V_k)=\lambda(V)$ due to the translation invariance of Lebesgue measure, we have

        $$1\leq \sum_{k=1}^\infty \lambda(V)\leq 3$$

        which is impossible, since summing infinitely many copies of $\lambda(V)$ yields either $0$ or infinity depending on the value of $\lambda(V)$

## Probability assignment
**Assignment of probabilities**. It is not feasible to assign probabilities to all subsets of a sample space $\Omega$
* *Bad solution*. Restrict the class of valid measures
* *Good solution*. Restrict attention to a set of events called $\sigma$-algebra (or $\sigma$-field)

**Probability space**. $(\Omega, {\mathcal{A}}, P)$ is a probability space

>**NOTE**. The set of events must be a $\sigma$-algebra
>* *Explain*. Otherwise, they cannot be assigned a probability

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Countable set**. A set $S$ is countable if there exists an one-to-one function $f:S\to\mathbb{N}$ where $\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,\dots\}$
* *Explain*. Every in $S$ has the correspondence to a different element in $\mathbb{N}$

**Borel $\sigma$-field**. The smallest $\sigma$-field which contains all the open subsets of the real line

**Power set of a set $S$**. The set of all subsets of $S$, including $\emptyset$ and $S$
* *Axiom of power set*. Given any set $X$, there is a set $\mathcal{P}(x)$ so that

    $$\forall z,[z\in\mathcal{P}(x)\Leftrightarrow \forall w \in Z,w\in X]$$
