# Schools of probability
**Physical probability**: probability associated with random physical systems (e.g. rolling dice, etc.)
* Other names: objective probabilitiy, frequency probability
* Interpretation: a given type of event tends to occur at a persistent rate (i.e. relative frequency) in a long run of trials

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ Physical probabilities either explain, or are invoked to explain, these stable frequencies
* Branches of physical frequency:
    * Frequentists probability
    * Propensity probability
* Statistical inference approaches: frequentist statistical methods (e.g. Fisher, Pearson, etc.)

>**NOTE**: statistical inference includes estimation and hypothesis testing

**Evidential probability**: probability associated to any statement, even when no random process is involved
* Other names: Bayesian probability
* Interpretation: probability of an event is its subjective plausibility, or the degree to which the statement is supported by the available evidence
    * Another interpretation: the degrees of belief
* Branches of evidential probability:
    * Classical (e.g. Laplace's) probability
    * Subjective probability
    * Epistemic or inductive probability
    * Logical probability
* Statistical inference approaches: accept the existence and importance of physical probabilities, but also consider evidential probabilities to be both valid and necessary in statistics

**Discussion**: the word "frequentist" is especially tricky
* To some philosophers, it refers to a particular theory of physical probability
* To scientists, "frequentist probability" is another name of physical probability
* To Bayesians, "frequentist statistics" is an approach to statistical inference which recognizes only physical probabilities

# Bayesian probability
## Classifical probability (Laplace's)
**History**: developed by Pierre-Simon Laplace from studies of games of chance (e.g. rolling dice)

**Definition of probability**: probability is shared equally between all possible outcomes, provided the outcomes can be deemed equally likely
* Formal: $P(A) = \frac{N_A}{N}$ where $A$ is an event and $N$ is the number of exclusive and equally likely outcomes of a random experiment

## Subjective probability (Bayesian probability)
**Definition of probability**: probability is the degree of belief of the individual assessing the uncertainty of a particular situation
* Example:
    * Assign a probability to the proposition that a proposed physical law is true
    * Determine how probable it is that a suspect committed a crime, based on evidence presented

**Prior probability**: the use of Bayesian probability involves specifying a prior probability (i.e. belief prior to observing evidences)
* Obtaining prior probability: consider whether the required prior probability is greater or lesser than a reference probability associated with a model or a thought experiment

**Drawbacks**: for a given problem, multiple though experiments could apply, and choosing one is a matter of judgement
* Reference class problem: different people may assign different prior probabilities

# Frequentist probability
## Frequetist probability
**Definition of probability**: the probability of an event is its relative frequency of occurrence after repeating a process a large number of times under similar conditions 
* Formal: $P(A) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n_A}{n}$ where $n_a$ is the number of occurrences of $A$ in $n$ trials

**Assumptions of frequentist probability**: the events are governed by some random physical phenomena, which are 
* Predictable (in principle) with sufficient information (e.g. tossing dice)
* (or) Essentially unpredictable (e.g. radioactive decay)

**Drawbacks**: 
* The probability cannot be accurately measured (i.e. different at different measurement)
    * Explain:
        * It's impossible to actually perform an infinity of repetitions of a random experiment
        * Different relative frequencies will appear in different finite series of trials
* If we accept that we only can measure a probability with some error of measurement

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ We still get problems since the error of measurement can only be expressed as a probability (i.e. frequency definition circular)

# Discussion
## Prediction
* Some account of probability emphasizes the role of prediction, which is mainly in the Bayesian vein
    * Explain: this was the main function of probability before the 20th century
* Prediction fell out of favor compared to the parametric approach, which modeled phenomena as a physical system which was observed with error
* Modern predictive approach was pioneered with the central idea of exchangability (i.e. future obesrvations should behave like past observations)
