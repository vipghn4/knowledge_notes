# Common random processes
**Bernoulli process**.
* *Bernoulli trials with parameter $p$*. A finite or infinite sequence $\{X_i\}$ of i.i.d variables with $X_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)$
* *Bernoulli process*. an infinite sequence of Bernoulli trials

**Poisson process**.
* *Poisson process with rate $\lambda$*. A process which satisfies
    * The number of positive outcomes in every fixed interval of time of length $t$ has the Poisson distribution with mean $\lambda t$
    * The numbers of positive outcomes in every collection of disjoint time intervals are independent
* *Assumptions underlying the Poisson process model*.
    * The numbers of occurrences in any collection of disjoint time intervals must be mutually independent
    * The probability of an occurrence during each very short time interval must be approximately proportional to the length of that interval
        * Formal: the probability of at least one occurrence during a time interval of length $t$ is $\lambda t + o(t)$ where $\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{o(t)}{t} = 0$
    
    >**NOTE**: this assumption can be relaxed at ths cost of more complicated mathematics
    
    * For each very short time interval, the probability that there will be multiple occurrences in that interval must have a smaller order of magnitude than the probability that there will be only one occurrence
        * Formal: the probability of multiple occurrence in a time interval of length $t$ must be $o(t)$ where $\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{o(t)}{t} = 0$
        * Explain: each very short time interval can approximately represent a binomial trial
* *Popularity of Poisson process*.
    * The model is computationally convenient
    * There's a mathematical justification for the model if the assumptions of Poisson process are satisfied
