# Common random processes
## Bernoulli process
**Bernoulli process**.
* *Bernoulli trials with parameter $p$*. A finite or infinite sequence $\{X_i\}$ of i.i.d variables with $X_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)$
* *Bernoulli process*. an infinite sequence of Bernoulli trials

## Poisson process
**Poisson process**.
* *Poisson process with rate $\lambda$*. A process which satisfies
    * The number of positive outcomes in every fixed interval of time of length $t$ has the Poisson distribution with mean $\lambda t$
    * The numbers of positive outcomes in every collection of disjoint time intervals are independent
* *Assumptions underlying the Poisson process model*.
    * The numbers of occurrences in any collection of disjoint time intervals must be mutually independent
    * The probability of an occurrence during each very short time interval must be approximately proportional to the length of that interval
        * *Formal*. The probability of at least one occurrence during a time interval of length $t$ is 
            
            $$\lambda t + o(t)$$
            
            where $\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{o(t)}{t} = 0$
        
        >**NOTE**. This assumption can be relaxed at ths cost of more complicated mathematics
    
    * For each very short time interval, the probability that there will be multiple occurrences in that interval must have a smaller order of magnitude than the probability that there will be only one occurrence
        * *Formal*. The probability of multiple occurrence in a time interval of length $t$ must be $o(t)$ where $\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{o(t)}{t} = 0$
        * *Explain*. Each very short time interval can approximately represent a binomial trial
* *Popularity of Poisson process*.
    * The model is computationally convenient
    * There's a mathematical justification for the model if the assumptions of Poisson process are satisfied

**Generality of Poisson processes**. A Poisson process can be used to model occurrences in space as well as time, e.g.
* Model telephone calls arriving at a switchboard
* Model atomic particles emitted from a radioactive source
* Model diseased trees in a forest
* Model defects on the surface of a manufactured product

**Example**. 
* *Simple example*. Consider radioactive particles
    * *Scenario*.Suppose that radioactive particles strike a certain target in accordance with a Poisson process
        * *Average rate*. Three particles per minute.
    * *Question*. Determine the probability that 10 or more particles will strike the target in a particular two-minute period
    * *Solution*.
        * *Number of strikes $X$ in any two-minute period*. Since the mean number of strikes in any one-minute period is $3$, i.e. $\lambda=3$

            $\to$ $X$ has the Poisson distribution with mean $6$
        * *Answer to question*. We can use the c.d.f of Poisson distribution to derive that $P(X\geq 10) = 0.0838$
* *Sophisticated example*.
    * *Scenario*. In April 1993, many thousands of people became ill during a cryptosporidiosis outbreak in Milwaukee, Wisconsin
        * *Water monitoring*. Different water systems have different systems for monitoring protozoa occurrence in drinking water
        * *Problem with monitoring systems*. Detection technology is not always very sensitive
            * *Solution*. 
                1. Push a large amount of water through a very fine filter
                2. Treat the material captured on the filter in a way that identifies Cryptosporidium oocysts
                3. The number of oocysts is counted and recorded
            * *Drawback*. Even if there is an oocyst on the filter, the probability can be as low as $0.1$ that it will get counted.
    * *Assumptions*. Consider a particular water supply
        * Oocysts occur according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$ oocysts per liter
        * The filtering system is capable of capturing all oocysts in a sample
        * The counting system has probability $p$ of actually observing each oocyst that is on the filter
        * The counting system observes or misses each oocyst on the filter independently
    * *Question*. What is the distribution of the number of counted oocysts from $t$ liters of filtered water?
    * *Mathematical modeling*.
        * *Assumptions*.
            * $Y$ is the number of oocysts in the $t$ liters, i.e.

                $$Y\sim\text{Poisson}(\lambda t)$$
            
            * $X_i = 1$ if the $i$th oocyst on the filter gets counted, otherwise $X_i=0$, i.e.

                $$X_i\sim\text{Bernoulli}(p)$$
            
            * $X$ is the counted number of oocysts, i.e. if $Y=y$ then $X=\sum_{i=1}^y X_i$, i.e. conditional on $Y=y$

                $$X\sim\text{Binomial}(y,p)$$
            
        * *Question*. We want the marginal distribution of $X$
        * *Solution*.

            $$f_1(x) &= \sum_{y=0}^\infty g_1(x|y) f_2(y)$$
    
    * *Further question*. How much water must we filter for there to be probability at least $0.9$, which we will count at least one oocyst
