# Separating hyperplane theorem
**Separating hyperplane theorem**:
* Assumptions:
    * $C, D$ are non-empty disjoint convex sets
* Conclusion: 
    * There exist $a \neq 0$ and b so that $a^T x \leq b$ $\forall x \in C$, $a^T x \geq b$ $\forall x \in D$
    * Separating hyperplane for $C, D$: $\{x|a^T x = b\}$

**Strict separation**:
* Assumptions:
    * $C, D$ are non-empty disjoint convex sets
* Conclusion: 
    * $C, D$ are strictly separated if there exist $a \neq 0$ and b so that $a^T x < b$ $\forall x \in C$, $a^T x > b$ $\forall x \in D$

**Converse separating hyperplane theorems**: "existence of a separating hyperplane implies that $C, D$ are disjoint" isn't true without additional constraints on $C, D$ (even beyond convexity)
* Intuition: when $C \cap D$ is a flat region (i.e. $C \cap D \in \textbf{bd}$ $C$)

# Supporting hyperplanes
**Supporting hyperplane**:
* Assumptions:
    * $C \in \textbf{R}^n$
    * $x_0 \in \textbf{bd}$ $C$
    * $a \neq 0$ and $a^T x \leq a^T x_0$ $\forall x \in C$
* Conclusion:
    * Supporting hyperplane to $C$ at $x_0$: $\{x|a^T x = a^T x_0\}$
    * Intuition: the tangent hyperplane to $C$ at $x_0$

**Supporting hyperplane theorem**:
* Assumptions:
    * $C$ is a nonempty convex set
    * $x_0 \in \textbf{bd}$ $C$
* Conclusion: there exists a supporting hyperplane to $C$ at $x_0$

**Partial converse of the supporting hyperplane theorem**:
* Assumptions:
    * $C$ is a closed, solid set
    * $C$ has a supporting hyperplane at every point in $\textbf{bd}$ $C$
* Conclusion: $C$ is convex

# BONUS
* Distance between two sets $C, D$: $\textbf{dist}$ $(C, D) = \text{inf}\{\|u - v\|u \in C, v \in D\}$
