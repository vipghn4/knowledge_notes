# Monomials and posynomials
**Monomial function**:
* Assumptions:
  * $f: \textbf{R}^n \rightarrow \textbf{R}$ where $\textbf{dom}$ $f = \textbf{R}^n_{++}$ is a function
  * $f(x) = c \prod_{i = 1}^n x_i^{a_i}$

  $\hspace{1.0cm} c > 0$

  $\hspace{1.0cm} a_i \in \textbf{R}$
* Conclusion: $f$ is a monomial function (or simply monomial)

**Posynomial function (with $K$ terms)**: a sum of $K$ monomials
  * Formal: $f(x) = \sum_{k = 1}^K c_k \prod_{i = 1}^n x_i^{a_{ik}}$

**Properties**:
  * Assumptions:
    * $f_p, g_p$ are posynomials
    * $c_p > 0$ is a scalar
    * $f_m, g_m$ are monominals
  * Posynomials:
    * Closed under addition: $f_p + g_p$ is a posynomial
    * Closed under multiplication: $f_p g_p$ is a posynomial
    * Closed under non-negative scaling: $c_p f_p$ is a posynomial
  * Monomials:
    * Closed under multiplication: $f_m g_m$ is a monomial
    * Closed under division: $f_m / g_m$ is a monomial

# Geometric programming
**Geometric programming**:
  * Assumptions:
    * $f_i$ is a posynomial for all $i \in [0, m]$
    * $h_i$ is a monomial for all $i \in [1, p]$
  * Conclusion: 
    * Geometric programming:
  
  $\hspace{1.0cm} \text{minimize}$ $f_0(x)$
  
  $\hspace{1.0cm} \text{subject to}$ $f_i(x) \leq 1$ $\forall i \in [1, m]$
  
  $\hspace{3.0cm} h_i(x) = 1$ $\forall i \in [1, p]$
    * Problem domain: $D = \textbf{R}^n_{++}$
    
>**NOTE**: the constraint $x \succ 0$ is implicit

**Extensions of geometric programming**:
* $f(x) \leq h(x)$ where $f$ is a posynomial and $h$ is a monomial: 
  * Standard form: $f(x) / h(x) \leq 1$
* $h_1(x) = h_2(x)$ where $h_1, h_2$ are non-zero monomials:
  * Standard form: $h_1(x) / h_2(x) = 1$

# Geometric program in convex form
* Assumptions:
  * $y_i = \log x_i$ and $b_i = \log c_i$
  * $f(x) = \sum_{k = 1}^K c_k \prod_{i=1}^n x_i^{a_{ik}}$
  * $a_k = (a_{1k}, ..., a_{nk})$
  * $y = (y_1, ..., y_n)$
* Observations:
  * $f(x) = \sum_{k = 1}^K \exp(a_k^T y + b_k)$ is a convex function of $y$
    * Explain: since $\exp(\cdot)$ is convex and $a_k^T y + b_k$ is an affine function of $y$
  * $\tilde{f}(y) = \log f(x)$ is a convex function of $y$
    * Explain: $\frac{\partial \tilde{f}(y)}{\partial^2 y} \geq 0$ (see note 2.5)
* Geometric program in convex form:
  * Idea:
    * Convert $x_i$ to $\exp(y_i)$ and $c_i$ to $\exp(b_i)$
      * Intuition: instead of expressing the $i$-edge's length as a power of $x_i$ and treat the base $x_i$ as variables
        
      $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ We express all edge lengths as powers of $e$ and treat the exponents $y_i$ as variables
    * Convert $f_i$ to $\tilde{f}_i = \log f_i$ and $h_i$ to $\tilde{h}_i = \log h_i$
      * Intuition: just an addition transformation to simplify $h_i$ while preserving the convexity of the problem
  * Formulation:

  $\hspace{1.0cm} \text{minimize}$ $\tilde{f}_0(y)$

  $\hspace{1.0cm} \text{subject to}$ $\tilde{f}_i(y) \leq 0$ $\forall i \in [1, m]$

  $\hspace{3.0cm} \tilde{h}_i(y) = 0$ $\forall i \in [1, p]$

# BONUS
**1. From geometric mean to geometric programming**:
* Geometric mean of $\{x_1, ..., x_n\}$: $M_x = (\prod_{i = 1}^n x_i)^{1/n}$
    * Intuition: $M_x$ is the edge length of a $n$-D cube whose volume equals to the volume of a box with edge lengths $x_1, ..., x_n$
* Monomials: $f(x) = c \prod_{i = 1}^n x_i^{a_i}$ represents the scaled volume of a $n$-dimensional box with edge lengths $x_1^{a_1}, ..., x_n^{a_n}$
* Posynomials: can be inferred from monomials
* Geometric programming:
    * Problem: minimize weighted sum of the volumes of some boxes
    * Constraints:
    * $f_i(x) \leq 1$: the weighted sum of volumes of boxes must be less than the volume of the unit cube in the corresponding space
    * $h_i(x) = 1$: the scaled volume of the box must be less than the volume of the unit cube in the corresponding space
