# Self-concordance
**Classical convergence analysis**:
* Idea: limit the third derivative
* Shortcomings:
  * The classical analysis depends on unknown (in practice) constants $(m, L, ...)$
    * $L$ is the Lipschitz constant
    * $m$ is the minimum curvature
  
  $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ The bound on the required number of Newton steps is almost never known specifically
  * The classical analysis isn't affinely invariant
    * Theoretical Newton method: changing coordinates has no effect
    * Classical analysis: the norm (i.e. $\|\nabla^2 f(x) - \nabla^2 f(y)\|_2$ and $\|x - y\|_2$) changes as we change the coordinates
  
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ The Lipschitz constant $L$ and $m$ change
  
  $\hspace{1.0cm} \implies$ The analysis completely change, despite of the fact that the Newton method isn't affected by changing coordinates
* Task: find a method, which is affine invariant, to say the third derivative is small
  * Formal: find an alternative to the assumptions
    * $m I \preceq \nabla^2 f(x) \preceq M I$
    * $\|\nabla^2 f(x) - \nabla^2 f(y)\|_2 \leq L \|x - y\|_2$

**Advantages of convergence analysis via self-concordance**:
* Do not depend on any unknown constants
* Give an affine-invariant bound on the number of steps in Newton's method

**Self-concordance**:
* Informal definition: a way to limit the third derivative of a function, in a way that is independent of affine coordinate changes
* Formal definition:
  * $f: \textbf{R} \to \textbf{R}$ is self-concordant if $|f'''(x)| \leq 2 f''(x)^{3/2}$ $\forall x \in \textbf{dom } f$
    * The power of $f''(x)$: to make the analysis affinely invariant
      * Explain: 
        * If we use $f'''(T y)$ and $f''(T y)$ for analysis, $f'''(T y)$ scales by $T^3$ while $f''(T y)$ scales by $T^2$, which is different from $T^3$
        
        $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow T$ won't be canceled in the analysis (i.e. the analysis is affinely variant)
        * From above, we need to take $f''(T y)^{3/2}$ instead of $f''(T y)$ since it has the same scale as $f'''(T y)$
        
        $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow T$ will be canceled in the analysis (i.e. the analysis is affinely invariant)
    * The constant $2$ in $2 f''(x)^{3/2}$: for simplify the formulas
  * $f: \textbf{R}^n \to \textbf{R}$ is self-concordant if $g(t) = f(x + tv)$ is self-concordant for all $x \in \textbf{dom } f, v \in \textbf{R}^n$
* Another interpretation: given a function $f: \textbf{R} \to \textbf{R}$, $f$ is concordant if
  * $f''(x) \geq 0$ $\forall x \in \textbf{dom } f$
  * $|\frac{d}{dx} \frac{1}{\sqrt{f''(x)}}| = \frac{1}{2 f''(x)^{3/2}} |f'''(x)|\leq 1$ wherever $f''(x) > 0$
  * $f'''(x) = 0$ where else

**Affine invariance**: 
* Statement: if $f: \textbf{R} \to \textbf{R}$ is self-concordant

  $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow \tilde{f}(y) = f(a y + b)$ is self-concordant

# Self-concordant calculus
**Properties of self-concordance**:
* Preserved under positive scaling $\alpha \geq 1$ and sum
  * Assumptions:
    * $f: \textbf{R}^n \to \textbf{R}$ is self-concordant
    * $\alpha \geq 1$ (due to the exponentiation of $f''(x)$)
    * $f_1, f_2$ are self-concordant
  * Conclusion:
    * $\alpha f$ is self-concordant
    * $f_1 + f_2$ is self-concordant
* Preserved under composition with affine function (explained above)
  * Assumptions: 
    * $f: \textbf{R}^n \to \textbf{R}$ is self-concordant
    * $A \in \textbf{R}^{n \times m}$
    * $b \in \textbf{R}^n$
  * Conclusion: 
    * $f(A x + b)$ is self-concordant
* Preserved under composition with logarithm
  * Assumptions:
    * $g: \textbf{R} \to \textbf{R}$ is a convex function
      * $\textbf{dom } g = \textbf{R}_{++}$
    * $|g'''(x)| \leq 3 \frac{g''(x)}{x}$ $\forall x$
  * Conclusion:
    * $f(x) = -\log (-g(x)) - \log x$ is self-concordant on $\{x|x > 0, g(x) < 0\}$

# Convergence analysis for self-concordant functions
**Summary**: there exist constants $\eta \in (0, 1/4], \gamma > 0$ that:
* If the Newton decrement $\lambda(x) > \eta$

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow f(x^{(k+1)}) - f(x^{(k)}) \leq -\gamma$
* If the Newton decrement $\lambda(x) \leq \eta$

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow 2 \lambda(x^{(k+1)}) \leq (2 \lambda(x^{(k)}))^2$

>**NOTE**: $\eta, \gamma$ depends on the backtracking parameters $\alpha, \beta$ (which we know)

**Complexity bound**: the number of Newton steps bounded by $\frac{f(x^{(0)}) - p^*}{\gamma} + \log_2 \log_2 (1/\epsilon)$

>**NOTE**: $\log_2 \log_2 (1/\epsilon)$ can be treated as a constant ($5$ or $6$)

# BONUS
* Function scaling in convergence analysis: the complexity bound is $\frac{f(x^{(0)}) - p^*}{\gamma} + \log_2 \log_2 (1/\epsilon)$
  * $\frac{f(x^{(0)}) - p^*}{\gamma}$ can be scaled by $\alpha$ if we multiply $f$ by $\alpha$
  
  $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ Can we multiply $f$ by some $\alpha \to 0^+$ so that the bound becomes approximately $\log_2 \log_2 (1/\epsilon)$ ?
  * The answer is **NO**, since the analysis above are only for self-concordant functions and self-concordance can only be preserved under scaling with $\alpha \geq 1$
