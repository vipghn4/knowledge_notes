# Unconstrained optimization problem
**Unconstrained optimization problem**:
* Assumptions:
    * $f: \textbf{R}^n \rightarrow \textbf{R}$ is convex 
    * $f$ is twice continuously differentiable
    * $\exists x^*, \inf_x f(x) = f(x^*)$
* Unconstrained optimization problem:

$\hspace{1.0cm} \text{minimize } f(x)$

**The optimal value**: $p^* = f(x^*)$

**A necessary and sufficient condition for $x^*$ to be optimal**: $\nabla f(x^*) = 0$
* Explain: $f$ is differentiable and convex

**Solving the unconstrained optimization problem**:
* Option 1: solve the equation $\nabla f(x^*) = 0$
    * Disadvantage: the option can only be applied in a few special cases
* Option 2: use iterative algorithms
    * Idea: compute a sequence of points $\{x^{(k)}\}$ that $f(x^{(k)}) \rightarrow p^*$ as $k \rightarrow \infty$
    * Minimizing sequence for the unconstrained optimization problem: $\{x^{(k)}\}$
    * Termination condition: $f(x^{(k)}) - p^* \leq \epsilon$ 
        * $\epsilon > 0$ is some specified tolerance

## Initial point and sublevel set
**Initial point and sublevel set**
* Initial point: $x^{(0)} \in \textbf{dom } f$ 
* Requirement of $x^{(0)}$: the sublevel set $S = \{x \in \textbf{dom } f|f(x) \leq f(x^{(0)})\}$ is closed
    * Explain: $\NEEDTOPROVE$

**Theorem**: the condition above is satisfied for all $x^{(0)} \in \textbf{dom } f$ if $f$ is closed
* Prove: direct prove
    * All subevel sets of $f$ are closed

# Strong convexity and implications
**Strong convexity**:
  * Definition: $f$ is strong convex on $S$ if there exists an $m > 0$ that $\nabla^2 f(x) \succeq m I$ $\forall x \in S$
    * $\succeq$ denotes the matrix inequality between symmetric matrices (i.e. $A \succeq 0$ means that $A$ is positive semi-definite)
  * Consequences of strong convexity:
    * Observations:
      * Due to Taylor's theorem with Lagrange remainder, for $x, y \in S$ and some $z$ on the line segment $[x, y]$,

      $\hspace{1.0cm} f(y) = f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T (y - x) + \frac{1}{2} (y - x)^T \nabla^2 f(z) (y - x)$
      * If $f$ is strong convex, $\frac{1}{2} (y - x)^T \nabla^2 f(z) (y - x) \geq \frac{m}{2} \|y - x\|_2^2$
    * Conclusion:
      * $f(y) \geq f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T (y - x) + \frac{m}{2} \|y - x\|_2^2$ $\forall x, y \in S$
      * If $m = 0$, the inequality above is the basic inequality characterizing convexity
      * If $m > 0$, the inequality above provides a better lower bound on $f(y)$ than the characterization of convexity alone
  * Intuition of strong convexity:
    * Consider the case where $\textbf{dom } f \subseteq \textbf{R}$
      * $\nabla^2 f(x) \geq m$ $\forall x \in S$ implies that the rate of change of $\nabla f(x)$ is greater than or equal to $m$ for all $x \in S$

      $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ The greater $m$ is, the more rapidly $\nabla f$ changes
    * Consider the general case where $\textbf{dom } f \subseteq \textbf{R}^n$
      * $f(y) \geq f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T (y - x) + \frac{m}{2} \|y - x\|_2^2$ $\forall x, y \in S$ implies that $f(y)$ is at least $\frac{m}{2} \|y - x\|_2^2$ higher than the tangent hyperplane of $f$ at $x$

**Strong convexity and suboptimality**:
* A lower bound on $p^*$: $p^* \geq f(x) - \frac{1}{2m} \|\nabla f(x)\|_2^2$
  * Explain:
    * Consider $g(y) = f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T (y - x) + \frac{m}{2} \|y - x\|_2^2$ is a convex function of $y$, which satisfies:
      * $g(y) \leq f(y)$ $\forall y \in S$
      * $g(y) = f(y)$ at $y = x$
    * $\inf_{y \in \textbf{dom } g} g(y) = f(x) - \frac{1}{2m} \|\nabla f(x)\|_2^2$ is obtained at $y = x - (1/m) \nabla f(x)$
    * From above, $p^* \geq g(x^*) \geq f(x) - \frac{1}{2m} \|\nabla f(x)\|_2^2$
  * Intuition: $\inf f(x) \geq \inf g(x)$
  * Another interpretation: if the gradient is small at $x$ then $x$ is nearly optimal
    * Explain: $p^*$ lies within the interval $[f(x), f(x) - \frac{1}{2m} \|\nabla f(x)\|_2^2]$
* A condition for suboptimality: $\frac{1}{2m} \|\nabla f(x)\|_2^2 \leq \epsilon \rightarrow f(x) - p^* \leq \epsilon$
  * Intuition: if the gap between $\inf_{y \in \textbf{dom } g} g(y)$ and $f(x)$ is less than or equal to $\epsilon$
  
  $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow f(x)$ is $\epsilon$-suboptimal
* A bound on $\|x - x^*\|_2$ (i.e. the distance between $x$ and any optimal point $x^*$): $\|x - x^*\|_2 \leq \frac{2}{m} \|\nabla f(x)\|_2$
  * Intuition 1: see the expansion below
  * Intuition 2: applied for all $\|x - y\|_2$ where $f(x) \geq f(y)$
    * Assumptions:
      * $x$ and $y$ are points that $\cos(y - x, \nabla f(x)) < 0$
      * $v = \frac{y - x}{\|y - x\|_2}$ (i.e. $v$ is the unit vector in the direction of $y - x$)
      * $f(x)$ is the height at location $x$
      * $\nabla f(x)^T v$ is our vertical velocity at $x$ in the direction of $y - x$
      * $v^T \nabla^2 f(x) v$ is our vertical acceleration at $x$ in the direction of $y - x$
    * Observations:
      * When moving forward the direction of $y - x$ from $x$, our change of height after moving $t$ unit steps is
      
      $\hspace{1.0cm} \nabla f(x)^T v t + \frac{1}{2} v^T \nabla^2 f(z) v t^2$
      
      $\hspace{2.0cm} z$ is some point between $x$ and $x + t (y - x)$ that $v^T \nabla^2 f(z) v$ is the average acceleration during our motion
      * When moving forward the direction of $y - x$ from $x$, if we want to stop at some $y$ where height $f(y)$ is lower than or equal to $f(x)$
        * The maximum number of unit steps $t$ allowed to take is $2 \frac{-\nabla f(x)^T v}{v^T \nabla^2 f(z) v}$
        * By setting $v$ to the unit vector of the direction, in which the velocity at $x$ is maximized, we have
        
        $\hspace{1.0cm} t \leq 2 \frac{\|\nabla f(x)^T\|_2}{v^T \nabla^2 f(z) v}$
        * By setting the average acceleration to its lower bound $m$, we have
        
        $\hspace{1.0cm} t \leq 2 \frac{\|\nabla f(x)^T\|_2}{m}$
    * Conclusion: $2 \frac{\|\nabla f(x)^T\|_2}{m}$ is the maximum number of unit steps (in any direction) taken so that the height $f(y)$ of the destination $y$ is lower than or equal to the initial height $f(x)$ at the start point $x$
  * Consequence: $x^*$ is unique

**Upper bound on $\nabla^2 f(x)$**:
* Observations:
  * Due to strong convexity, $f(y) \geq f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T (y - x) + \frac{m}{2} \|y - x\|_2^2$ $\forall x, y \in S$
  * From above, the sublevel sets contained in $S$ are bounded. Thus $S$ is bounded
    * Explain:
      * Due to convexity and continuity, $f(x) \geq p^* + \frac{m}{2} \|x - x^*\|_2^2$ $\forall x \in S$
      * From above, $\|x - x^*\|_2^2 \leq \frac{2}{m} (f(x) - p^*)$ $\forall x \in S$
      
      $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow \|x - x^*\|_2$ is bounded
    * Intuition:
      * $f(x) \leq f(x^{(0)})$ $\forall x \in S$ (i.e. $f$ is bounded above on $S$)
      * $f(x) \geq p^*$ $\forall x \in S$ (i.e. $f$ is bounded below on $S$)
      * $f(x)$ is continuous and strong convex on $S$
      * From above, $S$ must be bounded
  * From above, the maximum eigenvalue of $\nabla^2 f(x)$ is bounded above on $S$ (i.e. there exists a constant $M$ that $\nabla^2 f(x) \preceq M I$ $\forall x \in S$)
    * Explain:
      * $S$ is closed (due to the way we choose $x^{(0)}$) and bounded (as proved above)
      * $\nabla^2 f(x)$ is a continuous function of $x$
      * From above, due to the extreme value theorem, $\nabla^2 f(x)$ is bounded on $S$
  * From above, $f(y) \leq f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T (y - x) + \frac{M}{2} \|y - x\|_2^2$ for all $x, y \in S$
* Conclusion: $p^* \leq f(x) - \frac{1}{2M} \|\nabla f(x)\|_2^2$
  * Explain: $\inf_{y \in S}(f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T (y - x) + \frac{M}{2} \|y - x\|_2^2) = f(x) - \frac{1}{2M} \|\nabla f(x)\|_2^2$, which is achieved at $y = x - (1/M) \nabla f(x)$

**Condition number of sublevel sets**
* An upper bound on the condition number of $\nabla^2 f(x)$: $\kappa = M / m$
  * Explain: $m I \preceq \nabla^2 f(x) \preceq M I$
* The width of a convex set $C \subseteq \textbf{R}^n$, in the direction $q$, where $\|q\|_2 = 1$: $W(C, q) = \sup_{z \in C} q^T z - \inf_{z \in C} q^T z$
  * Intuition:
    * Assumptions:
      * $d_q$ is the line containing $u$
    * Conclusion: $W(C, q)$ is computed intuitively as follow
      * Step 1: for all $x \in C$, project $x$ onto $d_q$ and express its projection as $c_x q$
        * $c_x$ can be seen as the coordinate of $x$'s projection on $d_q$
      * Step 2: the width of $C$ in the direction $q$ is: $\sup_{z \in C} c_z - \inf_{z \in C} c_z$
* The minimum width of $C$: $W_\min = \inf_{\|q\|_2 = 1} W(C, q)$
* The maximum width of $C$: $W_\max = \sup_{\|q\|_2 = 1} W(C, q)$
* The condition number of $C$: $\textbf{cond } C = \frac{W_\max^2}{W_\min^2}$
  * Anisotropy (or eccentricity) of $C$: measured via the condition number of $C$
    * Small anisotropy: $C$ has approximately the same width in all directions
    * Large anisotropy: $C$ is far wider in some directions than in others

**A bound on the condition number of a sublevel set**
* Assumptions:
  * $m I \preceq \nabla^2 f(x) \preceq M I$ $\forall x \in S$
  * $C_\alpha = \{x|f(x) \leq \alpha\}$ is the $\alpha$-sublevel set of $f$
    * $p^* < \alpha \leq f(x^{(0)})$
* Observations:
  * $p^* + (M/2) \|y - x^*\|_2^2 \geq f(y) \geq p^* + (m/2) \|y - x^*\|_2^2$
    * Explain: due to convexity and differentiability, $\nabla f(x^*)^T (y - x^*) = 0$ 
  * From above, $B_\text{inner} \subseteq C_\alpha \subseteq B_\text{outer}$
    * $B_\text{inner} = \{y|\|y - x^*\|_2 \leq (2 (\alpha - p^*) / M)^{1/2}\}$ is a ball
    * $B_\text{outer} = \{y|\|y - x^*\|_2 \leq (2 (\alpha - p^*) / m)^{1/2}\}$ is a ball
* An upper bound on the condition number of $C_\alpha$: $\frac{M}{m}$
* A geometric interpretation of the condition number $\kappa(\nabla^2 f(x^*))$ of $\nabla^2 f(x^*)$:
  * Observations:
    * For any point $y$ close to $x^*$,
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} f(y) \approx p^* + \frac{1}{2} (y - x^*)^T \nabla^2 f(x^*) (y - x^*)$
    * From above, for $\alpha$ close to $p^*$, $ C_\alpha \approx \{y|\frac{1}{2} (y - x^*)^T \nabla^2 f(x^*) (y - x^*) \leq (\alpha - p^*)\}$
      * Intuition:
        * Consider local region of $x^*$ only
        * Start at $p^* = f(x^*)$ with velocity $0$ and acceleration $\nabla^2 f(x^*)$ (over the local region)
        
        $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ In order not to exceed $\alpha$, the travel time, which is represented by $y - x$, must satisfy $\frac{1}{2} (y - x^*)^T \nabla^2 f(x^*) (y - x^*) \leq (\alpha - p^*)$
    * Consider $h(y) = \frac{1}{2} (y - x^*)^T \nabla^2 f(x^*) (y - x^*)$ (i.e. the travelled distance mentioned in the intuition above)
      * $\sup_{h(y) = \alpha - p^*} \|y - x^*\|_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2 (\alpha - p^*)}{e_m}}$ (i.e. the maximum possible travel time), where $e_m$ is the minimum eigenvalue of $\nabla^2 f(x)$
      * $\inf_{h(y) = \alpha - p^*} \|y - x^*\|_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2 (\alpha - p^*)}{e_M}}$ (i.e. the minimum possible travel time), where $e_M$ is the maximum eigenvalue of $\nabla^2 f(x)$
    * Since $C_\alpha$ is an ellipsoid,
      * $\sup_{\|q\|_2 = 1} W(C_\alpha, q) = 2 \sqrt{\frac{2 (\alpha - p^*)}{e_m}}$ (i.e. the maximum time needed to travel along $C_\alpha$)
      * $\inf_{\|q\|_2 = 1} W(C_\alpha, q) = 2 \sqrt{\frac{2 (\alpha - p^*)}{e_M}}$ (i.e. the minimum time needed to travel along $C_\alpha$)
  * Conclusion: $\lim_{\alpha \rightarrow p^*} \textbf{cond } C_\alpha = \kappa(\nabla^2 f(x^*))$

**The strong convexity constants**
* Problem: $m$ and $M$ are known only in rare cases

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow \frac{1}{2m} \|\nabla f(x)\|_2^2 \leq \epsilon \rightarrow f(x) - p^* \leq \epsilon$ cannot be used as a practical stopping criterion
*  Meaning of $\frac{1}{2m} \|\nabla f(x)\|_2^2 \leq \epsilon \rightarrow f(x) - p^* \leq \epsilon$: if $\nabla f(x)$ is small enough then $f(x) - p^*$ is small
* A conceptual stopping criterion: if we terminate an algorithm when $\|\nabla f(x^{(k)})\|_2 \leq \eta$ where $\eta$ is small enough to be (very likely) smaller than $(m \epsilon)^{1/2}$

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow f(x^{(k)}) - p^* \leq \epsilon$ (very likely)

    >**NOTE**: a set is neither closed nor open if it contains some of its boundary points

* **Bounded set**: a set is bounded if it is, in a certain sense, of finite size

    * Important classes of closed functions:
        * Continuous functions with $\textbf{dom } f = \textbf{R}^n$
            * Prove:
                * Consider a sublevel set $S = \{x \in \textbf{dom } f:f(x) \leq c\}$ of $f$
                    * Case 1: $\forall x \in \textbf{dom } f, f(x) \leq c$

                    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow S = \textbf{R}^n$, thus closed
                    * Case 2: $\forall x \in \textbf{dom } f, f(x) > c$

                    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow S = \emptyset$, thus closed
                    * Case 3: $\exists x \in \textbf{dom } f, f(x) > c$ and $\exists x \in \textbf{dom } f, f(x) \leq c$

                    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow S \subset \textbf{R}^n$ and $S \neq \emptyset$, we will focus on this case
                * Lemma: if $\exists x_1 \in \textbf{dom } f, f(x_1) > c$ and $\exists x_2 \in \textbf{dom } f, f(x_2) < c$, then $\exists x \in \textbf{dom } f, f(x) = c$
                    * Prove: $\NEEDTOPROVE$
                    * Consequence: if case 3 happens, then $\exists x \in \textbf{dom } f, f(x) = c$
                * From above, the limit points of $S$ is $\{x \in \textbf{dom } f:f(x) = c\}$, which are also contained in $S$

                $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow S$ is closed
        * Continuous functions with open domains
            * Formal: $f(x) \rightarrow \infty$ as $x \rightarrow \textbf{bd dom } f$
            * Prove:
    * Counter example: $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ where $\textbf{dom } f = \textbf{R} / \{0\}$
        * Prove: direct prove
            * Consider a sublevel set $S = \{x \in \textbf{dom } f:f(x) \leq c\}$ of $f$ where $c \neq 0$

            $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow S = \{x:x \in \textbf{R} / \{0\}, x \geq \frac{1}{c}\}$
            * Now, suppose $c < 0$, then $S = [\frac{1}{c}, 0)$, which is not closed

            $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow f$ is not a closed function

* **My expansion on upper bound of $\|x - x^*\|_2$**:
  * Assumptions:
    * $x \in S$ is some point satisfying $x \neq x^*$ (i.e. $\|x^* - x\|_2 > 0$)
    * $g(y) = f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T (y - x) + \frac{m}{2} \|y - x\|_2$
    * $v = \frac{x^* - x}{\|x^* - x\|_2}$ (i.e. $v$ is the unit vector in the direction of $x^* - x$)
    * $I(T) = \int_{0}^T \nabla^2 f(x + t v) v dt$
  * Observations:
    * $I(T) = \int_x^{x + T v} \nabla^2 f(s) ds$ where $s = x + t v$

    $\hspace{2.1cm} = \nabla f(x + T v) - \nabla f(x)$
    * From above, $I(\|x^* - x\|_2) = \nabla f(x^*) - \nabla f(x) = -\nabla f(x)$
      * Explain: $x^*$ is a minimizer of $f$, which is convex and twice continuously differentiable
    * $v^T I(T) = -v^T \nabla f(x) \leq \|\nabla f(x)\|_2$ (due to Cauchy - Schwarz inequality)
    * $v^T I(T) = \int_0^T v^T \nabla^2 f(x + t v) v dt$

    $\hspace{2.6cm} \geq \int_0^T m \|v\|_2^2 dt$ (due to strong convexity)

    $\hspace{2.6cm} = \int_0^T m dt$

    $\hspace{2.6cm} = mT$
    * From above, $v^T I(\|x^* - x\|_2) = m \|x^* - x\|_2 \leq \|\nabla f(x)\|_2$

    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow \|x^* - x\|_2 \leq \frac{1}{m} \|\nabla f(x)\|_2$
  * Conclusion: $\|x^* - x\|_2 \leq \frac{1}{m} \|\nabla f(x)\|_2$
  * Intuition:
    * From $x$ to $y^*$, $\nabla g$ changes from $\nabla f(x)$ to $0$ (due to convexity and continuity)
    * From $x$ to $x^*$, $\nabla f$ changes from $\nabla f(x)$ to $0$ (due to convexity and continuity)
    * From above, $\nabla g$ and $\nabla f$ have to change by the same amount when moving from $x$ to the minimizer of each one
    * Due to strong convexity, $\nabla^2 f(x) \geq m I$, which implies that the rate of change of $\nabla f$ at $z_x$ is always at least the rate of change of $\nabla g$ at $z_y$ for all $z_x$ on the line segment $[x, x^*]$ and $z_y$ on the line segment $[x, y^*]$
    * From above, $\|x - y^*\| \geq \|x - x^*\|$ must hold
      * Intuition: the slower car must take more time to finish the race than the faster one
