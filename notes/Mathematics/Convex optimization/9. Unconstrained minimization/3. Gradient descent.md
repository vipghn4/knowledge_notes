# Gradient descent method

---

**Initialization**: choose a starting point $x \in \textbf{dom } f$

**Iteration**:
* $\Delta x = - \nabla f(x)$
* Line search: choose step size $t$ via exact or backtracking line search
* Update: $x = x + t \Delta x$

**Termination**: stopping criterion is satisfied

---

* Stopping criterion: usually of the form $\|\nabla f(x)\|_2 \leq \eta$ where $\eta > 0$ is small

# Convergence analysis (see the text book)
**Convergence result**: for strongly convex $f$

$\hspace{1.0cm} f(x^{(k)}) - p^* \leq c^k (f(x^{(0)}) - p^*)$ where $c \in (0, 1)$ depends on $m, x^{(0)}$ and the line search type

# Conclusion
**Conclusion**:
  * The gradient method often exhibits approximately linear convergence
    * Explain: $f(x^{(k)}) - p^*$ converges to $0$ approximately as a geometric series
  * The choice of backtracking parameters $\alpha, \beta$ has a noticeable but not dramatic effect on the convergence
  * An exact line search sometimes improves the convergence of the gradient method, but not much
  * The convergence rate depends greatly on the condition number of $\nabla^2 f(x)$ or the sublevel sets
    * Explain: when the condition number is larger, the gradient method is so slow that it's useless in practice

**Advantages & disadvantages**:
  * The main advantage: simplicity
  * The main disadvantage: the convergence rate depends so critically on $\textbf{cond } \nabla^2 f(x)$ or sublevel sets

**Practical results**: 
* Very simple, but often very slow
* Rarely used in practice

# BONUS
* Geometric series: a series with a constant ratio between successive terms
  * Formal: $a_{i+1} = c a_i$ $\forall i \geq 0$
