# Non-negative weighted sums
* Assumptions:
    * $f_1, ..., f_m$ are convex functions
    * $w_1, ..., w_m$ are non-negative scalars
* Conclusion: 
    * $\{\sum_i w_i f_i\}$ is a convex cone (if we treat $f_i$ as points)
    * $f = \sum_i w_i f_i$ is convex
    * If $f_i$ are strictly convex and $w_i$ are non-zero
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow f$ is strictly convex
* Intuition: consider 2D space
    * Consider $\textbf{dom}$ $f = \bigcap_i \textbf{dom}$ $f_i$, $f_i$ are convex for any sub-region of $\textbf{dom}$ $f$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ We only need to consider a very small sub-region $[L, R] \in \textbf{dom}$ $f$
    * $f_i(\theta x + (1 - \theta) y) \leq \theta f_i(x) + (1 - \theta) f_i(y)$ $\forall$ $x, y \in [L, R]$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow f(\theta x + (1 - \theta) y) \leq \theta f(x) + (1 - \theta) f(y)$ $\forall$ $x, y \in [L, R]$

# Composition with an affine mapping
* Assumptions:
    * $f: \mathbf{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$
    * $A \in \mathbf{R}^{n \times m}$
    * $b \in \mathbf{R}^n$
    * $g: \mathbf{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$ is defined by
    
    $\hspace{1.6cm} g(x) = f(A x + b)$
    
    $\hspace{1.6cm} \textbf{dom}$  $g = \{x|A x + b \in \textbf{dom}$ $f\}$
* Conclusion:
    * If $f$ is convex then $g$ is convex
* Intuition: consider a dimension $v$ of $\textbf{dom}$ $g$ 
    * $A x + b$ in fact:
        * Changes the rate of change of $x$ (without removing the monotonicity of $x$) along $v$ by rotating and scaling the manifold $\{(x, 0)|x \in \textbf{dom}$ $g\}$
        * Shifts the origin to some location
    * From above, $A x + b$ in fact:
        * Shifts the manifold defined by $f$
        * Changes the rate of change of $f$ (without changing the general form of shape) along $v$
* Hung's intuition: because $A x + b$ preserves (or reverses) the order of all elements in $\textbf{dom}$ $g$

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ The general form of shape of $f$ are preserved (or reversed)

# Pointwise maximum and supremum
**Pointwise maximum**
* Pointwise maximum between two functions:
    * Assumptions:
        * $f_1, f_2$ are convex functions
        * $f(x) = \text{max}\{f_1(x), f_2(x)\}$ is the pointwise maximum of $f_1, f_2$
        
        $\hspace{1.0cm} \textbf{dom}$ $f = \textbf{dom}$ $f_1 \cap \textbf{dom}$ $f_2$
    * Conclusion:
        * $f$ is convex
* Pointwise maximum between multiple functions:
    * Assumptions:
        * $f_1, ..., f_m$ are convex functions
        * $f(x) = \text{max}\{f_1(x), ..., f_m(x)\}$
    * Conclusion:
        * $f$ is convex
* Pointwise supermum:
    * Formal statement:
        * Assumptions:
            * $f(x, y)$ is convex $\forall$ $y \in A$
            * $g(x) = \sup_{y \in A} f(x, y)$
            
            $\hspace{1.0cm} \textbf{dom}$ $g = \{x|(x, y) \in \textbf{dom}$ $f$ $\forall y \in A, \sup_{y \in A} f(x, y) < \infty\}$
        * Conclusion:
            * $g$ is convex in $x$
    * Graphical interpretation:
        * Assumptions: the same as above
        * Conclution:
            * $\textbf{epi}$ $g = \bigcap_{y \in A} \textbf{epi}$ $f(. , y)$

**Representation as pointwise supremum of affine functions**:
* Theorem: almost every convex function can be expressed as the pointwise supremum of a family of affine functions
* Express a convex function as pointwise supremum of affine functions: $f$ as $f = \sup\{g(x)|g$ affine, $g(z) \leq f(z)$ $\forall z\}$
    * $f: \textbf{R}^n \rightarrow \textbf{R}$ is convex
    * $\textbf{dom}$ $f = \textbf{R}^n$

# Composition
**Scalar composition**:
* Assumptions: 
    * $h: D_h \rightarrow \textbf{R}$ where $D_h \subseteq \textbf{R}$
    * $g: D_g \rightarrow \textbf{R}$ where $D_g \subseteq \textbf{R}^n$
    * $f = h \circ g$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \textbf{dom}$ $f = \{x \in \textbf{dom}$ $g|g(x) \in \textbf{dom}$ $h\}$
    * $\tilde{h}$ is the extended-value extension of $h$
* Conclusion:
    * $f$ if convex if:
        * $h$ is convex, $\tilde{h}$ is non-decreasing and $g$ is convex
        * $h$ is convex, $\tilde{h}$ is non-increasing and $g$ is concave
    * $f$ is concave if:
        * $h$ is concave, $\tilde{h}$ is non-decreasing and $g$ is concave
        * $h$ is concave, $\tilde{h}$ is non-increasing and $g$ is convex
* Explain via second-order condition (for case 1):
    * Assumes that $g$ maps $\textbf{dom } g$ to a convex set $C$
    * $h$ is convex, $\tilde{h}$ is non-decreasing and $g$ is convex
        * $\frac{\partial h(g(x))}{\partial^2 x} = \frac{\partial h(g(x))}{\partial^2 g(x)} \frac{\partial g(x)}{\partial x}^2 + \frac{\partial h(g(x))}{\partial g(x)} \frac{\partial g(x)}{\partial^2 x}$
        * $\frac{\partial h(g(x))}{\partial^2 g(x)} \frac{\partial g(x)}{\partial x}^2 \geq 0$ since $h$ is a convex function (its Hessian is definitely semi-positive)
        * $\frac{\partial h(g(x))}{\partial g(x)}$ and $\frac{\partial g(x)}{\partial^2 x}$ have the same sign since $g$ is convex and $h$ is non-decreasing 
        * From above, the Hessian of $h$ w.r.t $x$ is definitely semi-positive
        
        $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow h$ preserves the convexity of $C$
* Explain via definition of convexity (for case 1): $\theta h(g(x_1)) + (1 - \theta) h(g(x_2)) \geq h(\theta g(x_1) + (1 - \theta) g(x_2)) \geq h(g(\theta x_1 + (1 - \theta) x_2))$
* Intuition: instead of getting intuition on the ordinary $(x, y)$ space, try to map the $x$-axis into the $g(x)$-axis and get intuition on the $(g(x), y)$ space
    * Assumptions:
        * $f: \textbf{R} \to \textbf{R}$ is a convex function
        * $g: \textbf{R} \to \textbf{R}$ is any function
        * $h: \textbf{R} \to \textbf{R}$ is defined by $h(x) = f(g(x))$
    * Observations:
        * We approximate $f$ by a piece-wise linear convex function $\tilde{f}: \textbf{R} \to \textbf{R}$ which is constructed by
            * Step 1: sample $n$ equally spaced points $x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n$ over $\textbf{dom } f$ where $n \to \infty$\
                * Formal: $x_{i+2} - x_{i+1} = x_{i+1} - x_i$ $\forall i$
            * Step 2: $\tilde{f}(x) = f(x_i)$ if $x \in [x_i, x_{i+1})$ for $i = 1, ..., n$
        * We approximate $h$ by a piece-wise linear convex function $\tilde{h}: \textbf{R} \to \textbf{R}$ which is defined by $\tilde{h}(x) = \tilde{f}(g(x))$
        * For $h$ to be convex, $\frac{h(x_{i+2}) - h(x_{i+1})}{g(x_{i+2}) - g(x_{i+1})} - \frac{h(x_{i+1}) - h(x_i)}{g(x_{i+1}) - g(x_i)} \geq 0$
        * Imagine further to get the condition on $g$ so that $h$ is a convex function

**Vector composition**:
* Assumptions:
    * $f(x) = h(g(x)) = h(g_1(x), ..., g_k(x))$ where $k \geq 1$
    * $h: \textbf{R}^k \rightarrow \textbf{R}$
    * $g_i: \textbf{R}^n \rightarrow \textbf{R}$
    * $\tilde{h}$ is the extended-value extension of $h$
* Conclusion:
    * $f$ is convex if:
        * $h$ is convex, $\tilde{h}$ non-decreasing in each argument and $g_i$ are convex
        * $h$ is convex, $\tilde{h}$ non-increasing in each argument and $g_i$ are concave
    * $f$ is concave if:
        * $h$ is concave, $\tilde{h}$ non-decreasing in each argument and $g_i$ are concave

# Minimization
* Assumptions:
    * $f$ is convex in $(x, y)$
    * $C$ is a convex non-empty set
* Conclusion:
    * $g(x) = \textbf{inf}_{y \in C}$ $f(x, y)$ is convex in $x$, provided $g(x) > \infty$ $\forall x$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \textbf{dom}$ $g = \{x|(x, y) \in \textbf{dom}$ $f$ for some $y \in C\}$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow \textbf{dom}$ $g$ is the projection of $\textbf{dom}$ $f$ on its $x$-coordinates
* Explain:
    * Consider $x_1, x_2 \in \textbf{dom } g$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow \theta f(x_1, y_1) + (1 - \theta) f(x_2, y_2) \geq f(\theta x_1 + (1 - \theta) x_2, \theta y_1 + (1 - \theta) y_2)$ where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ in $\textbf{dom } f$
    * Consider $y_1 = \arg \min_y f(x_1, y)$ and $y_2 = \arg \min_y f(x_2, y)$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow \theta g(x_1) + (1 - \theta) g(x_2) = \theta f(x_1, y_1) + (1 - \theta) f(x_2, y_2)$
    
    $\hspace{5.9cm} \geq f(\theta x_1 + (1 - \theta) x_2, \theta y_1 + (1 - \theta) y_2)$
    
    $\hspace{5.9cm} \geq \min_y f(\theta x_1 + (1 - \theta) x_2, y)$
    
    $\hspace{5.9cm} = g(\theta x_1 + (1 - \theta) x_2)$
    * From above, $g$ is a convex function

>**NOTE**: convexity doesn't imply continuity

# Perspective of a function
**Perspective of a function**:
* Assumptions:
    * $f: \textbf{R}^n \rightarrow \textbf{R}$ is a function
* Conclusion:
    * The perspective of $f$: $g: \textbf{R}^{n+1} \rightarrow \textbf{R}$ defined by
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} g(x, t) = t f(x / t)$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \textbf{dom}$ $g = \{(x, t)|x/t \in \textbf{dom}$ $f, t > 0\}$
* Intuition:
    * Transforming $(x, t)$ into $x/t$ means lengthen the $x$-axis $t$ times
    * Transforming $f(x)$ into $t f(x)$ means lengthen the $y$-axis (the axis of the value of $f$) $t$ times
    * From above, $g(x, t)$ means enlarging the manifold defined by $f$ $t$ times

**Convexity of perspective of a function**: if $f$ is convex (or concave) then $g$ is convex (or concave)

# BONUS
* Supermum:
    * Definition:
        * Assumptions:
            * $S \subseteq (P, \leq)$
        * Conclusion:
            * Upper bound of $S$: a point $a \in P$ such that $x \leq a$ $\forall x \in S$
            * Supremum (LUB - least upper bound) of $S$: a point $a$ such that $a \leq y$ $\forall$ upper bounds $y$ of $S$
    * Existence and uniqueness:
        * Existence: The supremum of $S$ doesn't exist if:
            * $S$ has no upper bound
            * The set of upper bounds of $S$ doesn't contain a minimal element
        * Uniqueness: if a supremum does exists, it's unique
    * Supermum vs maximum: if the maximum of $S$ exists then it's $\sup S$

* Partially ordered set: $P = (X, \leq)$
    * Ground set of $P$: $X$
    * The partial order of $P$: $\leq$

* How to gain intuition about the composition of two functions:
    * Assumptions:
        * $h, g$ are two functions
        * $f = h \circ g$
    * Steps to get intuition:
        * Intially, each element of the input of $h$ must increase monotonically along its corresponding axis
        * Think of $g$ as changing the rate of change of the input of $h$ (along each axis)
        * Along each axis $v$, we divide $(-\infty, \infty)$ into intervals, within each the sign of $\nabla_v g$ doesn't change
        * In each interval, we project the axis of the element $v$ of $\{g(x)|x \in \textbf{dom}$ $g\}$ onto the corresponding axis of $\textbf{dom}$ $h$ so that the positive direction of the two axis point at the same direction
        * Plot $h$ against the projected axis of $\{g(x)|x \in \textbf{dom}$ $g\}$ to gain intuition

* Monotonical function: a function between ordered sets that preserves (monotically increasing) or reverses (monotically decreasing) the given order

* General form of shape of a function (or a set): the general form of shape of a function is characterized by the order after transformation of elements in its domain
    * If the order of elements after mapping of two functions are the same then these functions have the same general form of shape
