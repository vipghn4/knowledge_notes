# Definition and examples
**Definition**:
  * Assumptions:
    * $f: \textbf{R}^n \rightarrow \textbf{R}$ is a function
  * Conclusion:
    * The conjugate of $f$: $f^*(y) = \sup_{x \in \textbf{dom} f} (y^T x - f(x))$

    $\hspace{1.0cm} \textbf{dom}$ $f^* = \{y|y \in \textbf{R}^n,  f^*(y)$ is bounded$\}$
    * $f^*$ is convex (it's the pointwise supremum of a family of convex functions of $y$)
  * Intuition:
    * Observations:
        * $f^*(y)$ satisfies:
          * $f^*(y) \geq y^T x - f(x)$ $\forall x \in \textbf{dom } f$
          * $f^*(y) \leq u$ for all $u$ that $u \geq y^T x - f(x)$ $\forall x \in \textbf{dom } f$
        * From above,
          * $f(x) \geq y^T x - f^*(y)$ $\forall x \in \textbf{dom } f$
          * $y^T x - f^*(y) \geq y^T x - u$ $\forall x \in \textbf{dom } f$ for all $u$ that $f(x) \geq y^T x - u$ $\forall x \in \textbf{dom } f$
    * Conclusion: consider the line $d: z = y^T x - f^*(y)$ and the curve $C: z = f(x)$
      * $d$ is the line with slope $y^T$ and offset $-f^*(y)$ that:
        * $d$ just touches $C$ (not intersects)
        * $d$ is lower than or equal to $C$
        * $d$ is higher than or equal to any line $d_1: z = y^T x - u$, which is also lower than or equal to $C$

    * Another intuition: $f^*(y)$ is the pointwise supremum of lines with slope $x$ and offset $- f(x)$ $\forall x \in \textbf{dom}$ $f$

# Basic properties
**Fenchel's inequality**: $f(x) + f^*(y) \geq x^T y$
  * Young's inequality: Fenchel's inequality when $f$ is differentiable

**Conjugate of conjugate**: 
  * Assumptions:
    * $f$ is a convex function
    * $f$ is closed ($\textbf{epi}$ $f$ is a closed set)
  * Conclusion:
    * $f^{**} = f$
  * Intuition:
    * Consider the 2nd intuition about convex conjugation: $f^*(y)$ is the pointwise supremum of lines with slope $x$ and offset $- f(x)$ $\forall x \in \textbf{dom}$ $f$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ Since $f$ is a convex function, the intuition above means that $\{x^T y - f(x)|x \in \textbf{dom}$ $f\}$ is the set of all tangent lines of $f^*(y)$
       
     $\hspace{1.0cm}$ Explain: as $x$ (the slope of each line) goes further from $x^*$ where $\nabla f(x^*) = 0$, $-f(x)$ (the offset of the line) becomes smaller
    * From the 1st intuition about convex conjugation: given $y$, $- f^*(y)$ is the offset of the line $d$, whose slope is $y$, that touches the manifold $M$ defined $f$ and is lower than or equal to all points in $M$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ For each slope $x$, $f(x)$ is the right offset so that the line with slope $x$ and offset $-f(x)$ touches the manifold $M$ defined by $f^*$ and is lower than or equal to all points in $M$
    
     $\hspace{1.0cm}$ Explain: since $f^*$ is convex, each of its tangent line is lower than or equal to all points in $M$
    * From above, $f^{**} = f$

**Differentiable functions**:
  * Legendre transform of $f$: the conjugate of $f$ in case $f$ was a differentiable function
  * Fenchel conjugate: the congate of $f$ in general case
  * Assumptions:
    * $f$ is convex and differentiable with $\textbf{dom}$ $f = \textbf{R}^n$
  * Conclusion:
    * Any maximizer $x^*$ of $y^T x - f(x)$ satisfies $y = \nabla f(x^*)$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm}$ (conversely) If $x^*$ satisfies $y = \nabla f(x^*)$ then $x^*$ maximizes $y^T x - f(x)$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ We can determine $f^*(y)$ for any $y$ for which we can solve $y = \nabla f(z)$ for $z$
    * Another interpretation: let $z \in \textbf{R}^n$ and $y = \nabla f(z)$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow f^*(y) = z^T \nabla f(z) - f(z)$

**Scaling and composition with affine transfomation**:
* Posterior affine transformation:
  * Assumptions:
    * $a > 0$, $b \in \textbf{R}$
    * $g(x) = a f(x) + b$
  * Conclusion:
    * The conjugate of $g$: $g^*(y) = a f^*(y/a) - b$
  * Intuition:
    * $f(x) + b$ means that we shift the manifold defined by $f$ upward by $b$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ The offset $-f^*(y)$ of all the tangent lines must increase by $b$, meaning that $f^*(y)$ must decrease by $b$
    * $a f(x)$ means that we scale the values of $f$ by $a$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ Each tangent slope is changed from $y/a$ into $y$
    
    $\hspace{1.5cm} \rightarrow$ Each offset (from $f(x)$) is changed from $f(x) + f^*(y/a)$ into $a (f(x) + f^*(y/a))$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm}$ Each offset (from $0$) is now $- (a - 1) f(x) - a f^*(y/a)$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm}$ Each tangent point is changed from $(x, f(x))$ into $(x, a f(x))$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ Each offset (from $0$) is now $- (a - 1) f(x) - a f^*(y/a) + (a - 1) f(x) = - a f^*(y/a)$
    * From above, $g^*(y) = a f^*(y/a) - b$ (at the same position)
* Prior affine transformation:
  * Assumptions:
    * $A \in \textbf{R}^{n \times n}$ is nonsingular
    * $b \in \textbf{R}^n$
    * $g(x) = f(A x + b)$
  * Conclusion:
    * The conjugate of $g$: $g^*(y) = f^*(A^{-T} y) - b^T A^{-T} y$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \textbf{dom}$ $g^* = A^T \textbf{dom}$ $f^*$
  * Intuition:
    * 2D:
      * Scaling $x$ by $a$ create a manifold which is $a$ times smaller than the manifold defined by scaling $f(x)$ by $a$
        
        $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ The offset is now $g^*(y)$ (in case of scaling x by a) $= g^*(y)/a$ (in case of scaling $f(x)$ by $a$)
      * Translating $a x$ by $b$ means shifting the origin (w.r.t $a x$) forward by $b/a$ (w.r.t the unit length of $a$ x-axis, which is $a$)
        
        $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ The offset (from the origin) is changed by $-b/a y$ (since the axis of values of $f$ isn't scaled)
      * From above, $g^*(y) = f^*(y/a) - b/a y$
    * n-D:
      * When we transform $x$ by $A$, $\nabla_x f$ changed from $A^{-T} y$ into $y$
      * When we shift $A x$ by $b$, we shift the origin by $A^{-1} b$ (w.r.t the new basis, which is the columns of $A$)
      
      $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ The offset is changed by $-<A^{-1} b, \nabla_x f>$ $= - b^T A^{-T} y$
      * From above, $g^*(y) = f^*(A^{-T} y) - b^T A^{-T} y$

**Sums of independent functions**:
* Assumptions:
  * $f_1$, $f_2$ are convex functions with conjugates $f_1^*$ and $f_2^*$
  * $f(u, v) = f_1(u) + f_2(v)$
* Conclusion:
  * The conjugate of $f$: $f^*(w, z) = f_1^*(w) + f_2^*(z)$
* Prove: $\sup (x + y) = \sup x + \sup y$ where $x, y$ are independent variables
