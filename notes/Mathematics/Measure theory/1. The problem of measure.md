# The problem of measure
**Measure problem in Euclidean geometry**. One of the most fundamental concepts in Euclidean geometry
* *Measure problem*. Compute the measure $m(E)$ of a solid body $E$ in one or more dimensions
    * *Examples*. $m(E)$ is referred in one, two, and three dimensions, as the length, area, or volume of $E$ respectively
* *Classical approach to compute measure of a body*. Originated from the
work of Archimedes
    1. Partition the body into finitely many components
    2. Move around each component by a rigid motion, e.g. a translation or rotation
    3. Reassembe those components to form a simpler body which presumably
has the same area

>**NOTE**. One could also obtain lower and upper bounds on
the measure of a body by computing the measure of some inscribed
or circumscribed body

* *Justification of measurement approach*. The approach can be justified by
    * An appeal to geometric intuition, or 
    * Postulating the existence of a measure $m(E)$ that can be assigned to all solid bodies $E$, and which obeys a collection of geometrically reasonable axioms

**Measure problem in analytic geometry**. With the advent of analytic geometry

$\to$ Euclidean geometry became reinterpreted as the study of Cartesian products $\mathbb{R}^d$
* *Consequence*. Using this analytic foundation rather than the classical geometrical one
    
    $\to$ It was no longer intuitively obvious how to define the measure $m(E)$ of a general subset $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$
* *Examples of unmeasurable cases*. Refer to "The motivation behind $\sigma$-algebra" note

**Solving measure problem**. 
* *Standard solution*. Since pathological sets, e.g. in Banach-Tarski paradox, almost never exist in practical applications of mathematics

    $\to$ The standard solution is to abandon the goal of measuring every subset $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, and only measure a certain subclass of non-pathological subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$, i.e. measurable sets
* *Subproblems of measure problem*.
    * What does it mean for a subset $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$ to be measurable?
    * If a set $E$ is measurable, how does one define its measure?
    * What nice properties or axioms does measure, or the concept of measurability, obey?
    * Are ordinary sets, e.g. cubes, calls, polyhedra, etc. measurable
    * Does the measure of an ordinary set equal the naive geometry measure of such sets?
* *Trade-off*. One can expand the class of measurable sets at the expense of losing one or more nice properties of measure in the process (e.g. finite or countable additivity, translation invariance, or rotation invariance)
* *Basic answers*. There are two basic answers which, between them, suffice for most applications, i.e.  Jordan measure and Lebesgue measure

**Jordan measure (or Jordan content) of a Jordan measurable set**. Closely related concept to Riemann integral, or Darboux integral

$\to$ This is elementary enough to be systematically studied and suffices for measuring most of the ordinary sets, in many branches of mathematics
* *Drawback*. When considering the type sets arising in analysis, particularly sets arising as limits of other sets
    
    $\to$ The Jordan concept of measurability is not quite adequate, and must be extended to a more general notion

**Lebesgue measurability**. The more general notion of Jordan measurability, with the corresponding notion of Lebesgue measure extending Jordan measure
* *Benefits*. With the Lebesgue theory, which can be viewed as a completion of the Jordan-Darboux-Riemann theory
    * One keeps almost all of the desirable properties of Jordan measure, 
    * One has the crucial additional property, which many features of the Lebesgue theory are preserved under limits
        * *Examples*. The fundamental convergence theorems of the Lebesgue theory, e.g. 
            * The monotone convergence theorem
            * The dominated convergence theorem

## Elementary measure
**Brief**. We discuss the even simpler notion of elementary measure, which allows one to measure a very simple class of sets, namely the elementary
sets, i.e. finite unions of boxes

**Intervals, bxoes, and elementary sets**.
* *Interval*. A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ of the form

    $$\begin{aligned}
    [a,b]=\{x\in\mathbb{R}:a\leq x\leq b\}
    [a,b)=\{x\in\mathbb{R}:a\leq x< b\}
    (a,b]=\{x\in\mathbb{R}:a< x\leq b\}
    (a,b)=\{x\in\mathbb{R}:a< x< b\}
    \end{aligned}$$

    * *Interval length*. The length $|I|$ of an interval $I=[a,b],[a,b),(a,b],(a,b)$ is given as $|I|=b-a$
* *Box in $\mathbb{R}^d$*. A Cartesian product $B=I_1\times\dots\times I_d$ of $d$ intervals $I_1,\dots,I_d$
    * *Box volume*. The volume $|B|$ of a box $B$ is given as $|B|=|I_1|\times\dots\times|I_d|$
* *Elementary set*. Any subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$, which is the union of a finite number of boxes

**Boolean closure**. The set of all elementary sets of $\mathbb{R}^d$ is closed under Boolean operations on set

**Measure of an elementary set**. 
* *Assumptions*. $E\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is an elementary set
* *Conclusion*.
    * $E$ can be expressed as the finite union of disjoint boxes
    * Given any two partitions of $E$ of disjoint boxes, i.e. 

        $$E=\bigcup_{i=1}^k B_i=\bigcup_{i=1}^{k'} B'_i$$

        then $m(E)=\sum_{i=1}^k |B_i|$ is independent of the partition, i.e.

        $$\sum_{i=1}^k |B_i| = \sum_{i=1}^{k'} |B'_i|$$

* *Elementary measure of $E$*. $m(E)$

**Extension to measure of arbitrary set $E\subset \mathbb{R}^d$**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $\frac{1}{N}\mathbb{Z}=\{\frac{n}{N}:n\in\mathbb{Z}\}$
    * $\#A$ is the cardinality of a finite set $A$
* *Conclusion*.

    $$m(E)=\lim_{N\to\infty} \frac{1}{N^d} \#(E\cap \frac{1}{N}\mathbb{Z}^d)$$

* *Consequence*. The continuous concept of measure can be viewed as a limit of the discrete concept of normalized cardinality
* *Drawbacks*. The measure works well for elementary sets, but it is not satisfactory for a number of reasons
    * One can concoct examples, in which the limit does not exist
    * Even when the limit exists, this measure does not obey reasonable properties, e.g. translation invariance

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Boolean operations on set**. Consider elementary sets $E,F\in\mathbb{R}^d$
* *Union*. $E\cup F=\{x:x\in E\lor x\in F\}$
* *Intersection*. $E\cap F=\{x:x\in E\land x\in F\}$
* *Set theoretic difference*. $E\setminus F=\{x\in E:x\notin F\}$
* *Symmetric difference*. $E\Lambda F=(E\setminus F)\cup (F\setminus E)$
