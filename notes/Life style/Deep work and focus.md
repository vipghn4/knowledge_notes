FOCUS development:
* Focus takes practice and deep work
* Deep work: An extended period of time spent focus on one activity with no distraction
    * General idea: If you want to get anything done in our world of distraction, deep work is a must
    * Two core abilities everybody needs today: To do both of these things, you must be able to work on a single task for long periods of time
        * Master hard things quickly
        * Produce at an elite level of quality and speed
    * Deep work is about direct focus, i.e. using all of your brain power to focus on a single task at hand, rather scattered focus, i.e. constantly switching between tasks
        * Explain:
            * Our brains need time to upload the next context of the task
            * When people are trying to do multi-tasks, they are constantly switching between different tasks

                $\to$ We are constantly unloading and uploading our brains with new contexts
* How to use deep work: Deep work are skills which can be built by the following steps
    * Set a certain time for concentration for everyday, i.e. make focus a habit
        * Doing deep work first in the morning, from 9:00 to 12:00
        * Deep work should not last more than 4 hours at a time
        * It is important to get rid of all distractions
    * Have a shutdown ritual
        * Burnout is not the price we have to pay for success
        * Restoring and de-stimulating your brain daily is as important as focusing
        * Brain is like a muscle, after we've done our deep work session for the day, unplugging is important to help increase concentration energy levels back to normal
            * Unplugging deep work: Completely forget about work, i.e. fully stop working
            * Unplugging ways:
                * Take a nap
                * Mediate for 10 - 20 minutes
                * Go for short walk out in nature
                * Do not check social media news, since you focus on news, not unplugging
            * Unplugging is as important as working
    * Have a rule for being distracted
        * We need to check emails, Facebook, etc.
        * We should do these only during a certain part of the day
        * Do not checkout social media until deepwork is over
    * Take care of your body
        * Get enough sleep: at least 7 - 9 ours
        * Exercising well: When exercising, our brain is like a plastic, our focus is improved, and our brain's short-term memory functions at its peak up
        * Stay hydrated: Enough oxy for your brain to function correctly, drink more water
        * Eat healthily:
    * Pomodoro technique
