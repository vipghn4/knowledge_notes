## Magnetic field
**Magnet**. A material or object producing a magnetic field, which is invisible but is responsible for the most notable property of a magnet, i.e. a force pulling on other ferrormagnetic materials and attracts or repels other magnets
* *Magnetic field*. The magnetic flux density $\mathbf{B}$ is a vector field, which is defined at a given point in space as having the following properties
    * *Direction*. Along the orientation of a compass needle
    * *Magnitude (strength)*. Proportional to how strongly the compass needle orients along the direction
* *Magnetic moment*. A vector characterizing the magnet's overall magnetic properties
    * *Example*. For a bar magnet, 
        * The direction of the magnetic moment points from the south to the north
        * The magnitude relates to how strong and how far these poles are
    * *Units of measurement*. Ampere times meters squared

**Magnetic moment**. The magnetic strength and orientation of a magnet or other object producing a magnetic field
* *Formal*. A vector relating the aligning torgue on the object from an externally applied magnetic field to the field vector itself

**Magnetic field**. A vector field describing the magnetic influence on moving electric charges, electric currents, and magnetic materials
* *Magnetic field strength and magnetic flux density*.
    * *Magnetic field strength $\mathbf{H}$*. Measured in the base units of ampere per meter
        * *Intuition*. $\todo$
    * *Magnetic flux density $\mathbf{B}$*. Measured in tesla, i.e. kilogram per square second per ampere
        * *Tesla meaning*. A particle carrying a charge of one coulomb, and moving perpendicularly through a magnetic field of one tesla, at a speed of one metre per second, experiences a force with magnitude one newton

            $$T=\frac{V\cdot s}{m^2}$$
        * *Intuition*. $\todo$
* *Magnetic field production*. Magnetic fields are produced by moving electric charges and the intrinsic magnetic moments of elementary particles with a fundamental quantum theory, their spin
    * *Elementary particle*. A subatomic particle, which is not composed of other particles
