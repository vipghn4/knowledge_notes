# 2. Functions
## Small
**Principle**. Functions should be small, very small
* *1980s principle*. A function should be no bigger than a screen-full
    * *Drawbacks*. screen grows larger as the time goes on
* *Expert-level principle*. 
    * Every function is just two, three, or four lines long
    * Each function was transparently obvious and told a story
    * Each function led us to the next in a compelling order

**Blocks and indenting**. The blocks within `if`, `else`, `while`, etc. should be one line long (i.e. should be a function call)
* *Blocks*.
    * The enclosing function is small
    * Add documentary value (i.e. the function called within the block can have a nicely descriptive name)
* *Indent*.
    * Functions shouldn't be large enough to hold nested structures
    
        $\to$ The indent level of a function shouldn't be larger than one or two

**Example**.
```java
public static String renderPageWithSetupsAndTeardowns(
    PageData pageData, boolean isSuite) throws Exception {
    if (isTestPage(pageData))
        includeSetupAndTeardownPages(pageData, isSuite);
    return pageData.getHtml();
}
```

## Do one thing
**Principle**. Functions should do one thing, they should do it well, they should do it only
* *One thing*: We can describe the function by describing it as a brief paragraph

**Tricks**.
* Every steps of the function should be one level of abstraction below the stated name of the function
* A test for "one thing" is if we can extract another function from our function with a name which isn't merely a restatement of its (i.e. out function) implementation
* In case our function can be divided into sections

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ Our function is doing more than one thing

## One level of abstraction per function
**Principle**. Make sure that the statements in our function are all at the same level of abstraction
* *Consequence*. Our function can only do one thing

**Effects of mixing levels of abstraction**.
* Readers may not be able to tell whether a particular expression is an essential concept or a detail
* Once details are mixed with essential concepts

    $\to$ More and more details tend to be within the function

## Reading code from top to bottom: the stepdown rule
**Principle**. Read code like a top-down narrative
* *Idea*. Every function should be followed by those at the next level of abstraction

    $\to$ We can read the program, descending one level of abstraction at a time as we read down the list of functions

**Example**. We want to be able to read the program as if it were a set of paragraphs, each of which is describing the current level of abstraction
```markdown
To include the setups and teardowns, we include setups, then we include the test page content, and then we include the teardowns.
    To include the setups, we include the suite setup if this is a suite, then we include the regular setup.
    To include the suite setup, we search the parent hierarchy for the “SuiteSetUp” page and add an include statement with the path of that page.
    To search the parent. . .
```

**Tricks**.
* Keep functions short
* Make sure the function do "one thing"

## Switch statements
**Principle**. If we have to use `switch`, each `switch` statement should be buried in a low-level class and is never repeated so that no one has to see it
* *Explain*. `switch` statements always do $N$ things
* *Idea*. use polymorphism (OOP)

**Example**. Use `AbstractFactory` (design pattern)

```java
public abstract class Employee {
    public abstract boolean isPayday();
    public abstract Money calculatePay();
    public abstract void deliverPay(Money pay);
}
// -----------------
public interface EmployeeFactory {
    public Employee makeEmployee(EmployeeRecord r) throws InvalidEmployeeType;
}
// -----------------
public class EmployeeFactoryImpl implements EmployeeFactory {
    public Employee makeEmployee(EmployeeRecord r) throws InvalidEmployeeType {
        switch (r.type) {
            case COMMISSIONED:
                return new CommissionedEmployee(r) ;
            case HOURLY:
                return new HourlyEmployee(r);
            case SALARIED:
                return new SalariedEmploye(r);
            default:
                throw new InvalidEmployeeType(r.type);
        }
    }
}
```

## Use descriptive names
**Principle**. Function name should describes what the function does
* *Ward's principle*. Each routine should be pretty much what we expects

**Tricks**. 
* *Name length*. don't be afraid to make a name long 
    * Long descriptive name is better than a short enigmatic name
    * Long descriptive name is better than long descriptive comment
    * Use a naming convention which allows multiple words to be easily read in function names

        $\to$ We can make use of those multiple words to give the function a name which says what it does
* *Time for choosing name*. Don't be afraid to spend time choosing a name
    * We should try several different names and read the code with each in place
    * Use IDEs which make it trivial to change names
* Use the same phrases, nouns, and verbs in the function names we choose for our modules
    * *Explain*. We should be consistent in our names

## Function arguments
**Principle**. The more arguments exists, the readers have to interpret them more each time they use our function
* *Ideal number of arguments*: $0$
* *Should-avoid number of arguments*: $3$
* *Special-verification-required number of arguments*: $n$ where $n > 3$

>**NOTE**: $n > 3$ shouldn't be used anyway

**Arguments in testing**. The more arguments, the harder to test (i.e. the number of configurations grows exponentially)

**Output arguments**: harder to understand than input arguments
* *Explain*. we don't usually expect information to be going out through the arguments, but the return value

## Common monadic forms
**Principle**. 
* What readers expect when they pass a single argument into a function are
    * We may be asking a question about that argument
    * We may be operating on that argument, transforming it into something else then return
* Event is a function with inputs but no output

>**NOTE**: it should be very clear to the reader that this is an event, and its names and contexts should be chosen carefully

**Tricks**.
* We should choose names which make the distinction clear
* Always use the two forms of operations (above) in a consistent context
* Try to avoid any monadic functions which don't follow the forms above

## Flag arguments
**Principle**. Flag arguments (e.g. passing a boolean into a function) are ugly and a truly terrible practice
* *Explain*. Flag arguments complicates the signature of the method

    $\to$ Flag arguments imply that the function does more than one thing

**Tricks**. Use two separated functions instead of a function with flag argument

## Dyadic functions
**Principle**. A function with two arguments is harder to understand than a monadic function

**Tricks**.
* The code should be written so that the readers won't ignore any part of code
    * *Explain*. The part we ignore are where the bugs will hide
* Dyadic function comes at a cost and we should take advantage of what mechanisms may be available to convert them into monads

## Triads
**Principle**. Functions with three arguments are significantly harder to understand than dyads

$\to$ We should very carefully before creating a triad

## Arguments objects
**Principle**. When a function seems to need more than two or three arguments, some of those arguments must be wrapped into a class of their own

>**NOTE**. Reducing the number of arguments by creating objects may seem cheating, but it's not
>* *Explain*. The grouped arguments are likely part of a concept which deserves a name of its own

## Argument lists
**Principle**. When we want to pass a variable number of arguments, each of which is treated equally

$\to$ They are equivalent to a single argument of type `List`

## Verbs and keywords
**Principle**. A good function name can go a long way toward explaining 
* The intent of the function
* The order and intent of the arguments

**Tricks**.
* *Verb*: In monadic functions, the function and argument should form a very nice verb / noun pair
    * *Example*. `write(name)`
* *Keyword*. Encode the names of the arguments into the function name
    * *Example*. `assertEquals` is converted into `assertExpectedEqualsActual`
    * *Consequence*. We don't need to remember the ordering of the arguments

## No side effects
**Principle**. Our function promises to do one thing, but it also does other hidden things (i.e. side effects), and we should avoid this

## Output arguments
**Principle**. Arguments are most naturally interpreted as inputs to a function

$\to$ They shouldn't be used as output

## Command query separation
**Principle**. Functions should either do something, or answer something, but not both
* *Explain*. Doing both often leads to confusion

## Prefer exceptions to returning error codes
**Principle**. Returning error codes from command functions is a subtle violation of command query separation

$\to$ We should use exception instead

## Extract try / catch blocks
**Principle**. Try / catch blocks are ugly and we should extract their bodies into functions of their own
* *Explain*. They confuse the structure of the code and mix error processing with normal processing

## Error handling is one thing
**Principle**. A function which handles errors should do nothing else
* *Consequence*. If the keyword `try` exists, it should be the very first word in the function and there should be nothing after `catch` blocks

## Don't repeat yourself
**Principle**. Try to avoid code duplication
* *Explain*. Each time the algorithm change, we need to modify many things

## Structured programming
**Principle**. Every function, and every block within a function, should have one entry and one exit
* *Explain*.
    * There should be only one `return` statement in a function
    * There should be no `break` or `continue` statements in a loop
    * There should be no `goto` statemen
