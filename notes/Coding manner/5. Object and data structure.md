# 5. Object and data structure
## Data abstraction
**Principle**. Hiding implementation is about abstraction, not putting a layer of functions between the variables
* *Explain*. A class doesn't simply push its variables out through getters and setters

$\to$ It exposes abstract interfaces which allow its users to manipulate the essence of the data, without knowing its implementation
* *Motivation*. We don't want to expose the details of our data, we want to express our data in abstract terms

**Example**.
* *Bad example*. Provide concrete terms to communicate the fuel level of a vehicle

    ```java=
    public interface Vehicle {
        double getFuelTankCapacityInGallons();
        double getGallonsOfGasoline();
    }
    ```

* *Good example*. Provide a abstraction of percentage for the fuel level of a vehicle

    ```java=
    public interface Vehicle {
        double getPercentFuelRemaining();
    }
    ```

**Trick**. The worst option is to totally add getters and setters to our attributes

## Data / object anti-symmetry
**Principle**. Object and data structure are virturally opposite
* *Object*. Hide their data behind abstractions and expose functions which operate on that data
* *Data structure*. Expose their data and have no meaningful functions

**Procedural code and object-oriented code**.
* *Procedural code*. Code using data structures
    * *Advantage*. Easy to add new functions without changing the existing data structures
    * *Disadvantage*. Hard to add new data structures since all the functions must change
    * *Example*.

    ```java=
    class Square { ... }

    class Rectangle { ... }

    class Geometry {
        public double area(Object shape) {
            if (shape instanceof Square) { ... }
            if (shape instanceof Rectangle) { ... }
        }
    }
    ```

    * *Usage*. When we want to add new functions rather than data types

* *Object-oriented code*.
    * *Advantage*. Easy to add new classes without changing existing functions
    * *Disadvantage*. Hard to add new functions since all classes must change
    * *Example*.

    ```java=
    class Square implements Shape {
        public double area() { ... }
    }

    class Rectangle implements Shape {
        public double area() { ... }
    }
    ```

    * *Usage*. In complex systems, where we want to add new data types rather than new functions

## The law of demeter
**The law of demeter (LoD)**. A module shouldn't know about the innards of the objects it manipulates
* *Explain*. Objects hide their data and expose operations

    $\to$ Objects shouldn't expose its internal structure through accessors
* *Formal*. a method $f$ of a class $C$ should only call
    * $C$
    * An object created by $f$
    * An object passed as an argument to $f$
    * An object held in an instance variable of $C$
    * A global variable accessible by $C$, in the scope of $f$

    >**NOTE**. A method shouldn't invoke methods on objects which are returned by any of the allowed functions (i.e. talk to friends, not to strangers)

* *Another interpretation*. When one wants a dog to walk, one doesn't command the dog's legs to walk directly

    $\to$ One commands the dog, then the dog commands on its own legs

**Violations of LoD**. "Use more than one dot"
* *Violation*. `a.b.Method()`
* *No violation*. `a.Method()`

**Advantages and disadvantages**.
* *Advantages*. The software is more maintainable and adaptable since objects are less dependent on the internal structure of other objects

    $\to$ Object containers can be changed without re-working their callers
* *Disadvantage*. We have to write many wrapper methods to propagate calls to components
    * *Method level*. LoD leads to arrow interfaces, giving access to only as much information as it needs to do its job
    * *Class level*. LoD leads to wide (i.e. enlarged) interfaces, since LoD requires introducing many auxiliary methods instead of digging directly into the object structure

### Train wrecks
**Train wrecks**. A snippet of codes of the form, i.e. it looks like a bunch of coupled train cars

```java=
Options opts = ctxt.getOptions();
File scratchDir = opts.getScratchDir();
final String outputDir = scratchDir.getAbsolutePath();
```

**Violation of LoD**.
* If `ctxt`, `Options`, and `ScratchDir` are objects

    $\to$ Their internal structure should be hidden rather than exposed (i.e. violate LoD)
* If `ctxt`, `Options`, and `ScratchDir` are data structures with no behavior

    $\to$ LoD isn't violated

    >**NOTE**. In case of data structures, use `outputDir = ctxt.options.scratchDir.absolutePath` instead
    >* *Explain*. Data structure simply had public variables and no functions (note that some standards demand data structures have accessors and mutators)

### Hybrids
**Principle**. We should avoid hybrids of object and data structure
* *Explain*. Hybrids make it hard to add new functions and new data structures

**Hybrids of object and data structure**. Lead to functions which do significant things, public variables, public accessors and mutators

$\to$ This is the worst of both objects and data structures

### Hiding structure
**Principle**. We should ask objects to do the work related to its internal components, rather than accessing them

**Observations**. Consider the example above
* If `ctxt`, `Options`, and `ScratchDir` are objects, we can avoid violating LoD by
    * *Option 1*. `ctxt.getAbsolutePathOfScratchDirectoryOption();`
        * *Drawback*. Lead to explosion of methods in `ctxt`
    * *Option 2*. `ctx.getScratchDirectoryOption().getAbsolutePath()`
        * *Drawback*. `getScratchDirectoryOption()` should return a data structure, not an object
* If `ctxt` is an object, we should be telling it to do something, not asking it about its internals

    $\to$ We can ask `ctxt` to do the work related to its internal components, rather than accessing them

## Data transfer objects
**Principle**. The quintessential form of a data structure is a class with public variables and no functions (i.e. data transfer object - DTO)

**Advantage of DTOs**. DTOs are very useful structures, especially when communicating with datasets or parsing messages from sockets or etc.
* *Explain*. DTOs are the first in a series of translation stages which convert raw data in database into objects in the application code

**Example**.

```java=
public class Address {
    private String street;
    private String streetExtra;
    private String city;
    private String state;
    private String zip;

    public Address(String street, String streetExtra,
                   String city, String state, String zip) {
        this.street = street;
        this.streetExtra = streetExtra;
        this.city = city;
        this.state = state;
        this.zip = zip;
    }

    public String getStreet() {
        return street;
    }

    public String getStreetExtra() {
        return streetExtra;
    }

    public String getCity() {
        return city;
    }

    public String getState() {
        return state;
    }

    public String getZip() {
        return zip;
    }
}
```

### Active record
**Active record**. A special form of DTOs (i.e. data structures with public variables) but have navigational methods like `save` and `find`
* *Usage*. Direct translation from database tables, or other data source

**Principle**. Don't treat active records as though they were objects by putting business rule methods in them
* *Explain*. This creates a hybrid between data structure and an objec
