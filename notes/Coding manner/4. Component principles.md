# Component principles
## Components
**Components**. Units of deployment, i.e. smallest entities which can be deployed as part of a system
* *Example*. `.jar` files in Java, `.dll` files in .Net, or `.so` file in C / C++ 
* *Usage*.
    * Linked together into a single executable
    * Aggregated into a single archive, e.g. `.a` file
    * Independently deployed as separate dynamically loaded plugins
* *Desired property*. Well-designed components always retain the ability to be independently deployable and, therefore, independently developable

### Brief history of components
**Early days**
* *Early years of software development*. Programmers controlled the memory location and layout of their programs

$\to$ The first lines of code in a program would be the `origin` statement, which declared the address at which the program was to be loaded

>**NOTE**. This is one of the first decisions a programmer needed to make

* *Accessing a library function*. Programmers included the source code of the library functions with their application code, and compiled them as a single program

    $\to$ Libraries were kept in source, not in binary

    * *Drawback*. 
        * During this era, devices were slow and memory was expensive, therefore, limited

            $\to$ Compilers needed to make several passes over the source code, but memory was to limited to keep all the source code resident
        * From above, the compiler had to read in the source code several times, using the slow devices
* *Dynamic linking solution*. 
    * *Description*.
        * Programmers separated the source code of the library from the applications

            $\to$ They compiled the function library separately and loaded the binary at a known address
        * Programmers created a symbol table for the function library and compiled that with their application code

            $\to$ When they want to run an application, they would load the binary function
    * *Drawback*. As applications grew to be larger than the space allotted for them

        $\to$ Programmers had to split their applications into two address segments, jumping around function library

        >**NOTE**. As programmers added more functions to the function library, it exceeded its bounds, and they had to allocate more space for it

**Recent days**.
* *Recent years of software development*. Programmers today rarely have to think about where a program is loaded in the memory of the computer

### Relocatability
**Relocatability**. Solution to dynamic linking solution is relocatable binaries
* *Idea*. The compiler was changed to output binary code, which could be relocated in memory by a smart loader
    * The loader would be told where to load the relocatable code
    * The relocatable code was instrumented with flags telling the loader which parts of the loaded data had to be altered to be loaded at the selected address

        $\to$ This usually means adding the starting address to any memory reference addresses in the binary
* *Consequence*. The programmer can tell the loader where to load the function library, and where to load the application
  
**External reference and definition**. The compiler was changed to emit the names of the functions as metadata in the relocatable binary
* *External reference and definition*.
    * *External reference*. Emitted by the compiler if a program called a library function
    * *External definition*. Emitted by the compiler if a program defined a library function
* *Linking process*. The loader could link the external references to the external definitions, once it had determined where it had loaded those definitions

### Linkers
**Usage of the linking loader**. Allow programmers to divide their programs up onto separately compilable and loadable segments
* *Drawback*. Linking loaders work well when relatively small programs were being linked with relatively small libraries

    $\to$ For bigger ones, they are not too slow to tolerate
    * *Explain*. The linking loaders had to read dozens, if not hundreds, of binary libraries to resolve the external references

        $\to$ As the program grew larger, and more library functions accumulated in libraries, the linking loader could take more than an hour to load the program
* *Solution*. Loading and linking were separated into two phases

    $\to$ Programmers took the slow part (linking) and put it into a separate application, called *the linker*

**Linker**. The output of the linker was a linked relocatable that a relocating loader could load very quickly

$\to$ Programmers can prepare an executable using the slow linker, but then they could load it quickly, at any time
* *Historical motivations*. In 1980s, source modules, which are about hundreds of thousands of lines, were compiled from `.c` files to `.o` files

    $\to$ These files are fed into the linker to create executable files, which could be quickly loaded
    * *Problem*. Compiling each individual module was relatively fast, but compiling all modules took a bit of time

        $\to$ The linker would then take even more time
    * *Murphy's law of program size*. Programs will grow to fill all available compile and link time
    * *Moore's law of hardware capacity*. Battled with Murphy's law and won the battle

        $\to$ The time spent linking had begun to shrink faster than our ambitions could make programs grow
        * *Consequence*. The idea of a linking loader became feasible again

            $\to$ This was the era of Active-X, shared libraries, and the beginning of `.jar` files

**Conclusion**. The dynamically linked files, which can be plugged together at runtime, are the software components of our architectures

## Component cohension
**Question of interest**. Which classes belong in which components
* *Key principles*.
    * The reuse / release equivalance principle (REP)
    * The common closure principle (CCP)
    * The common reuse principle (CRP)

### The reuse / release equivalance principle
**Motivation**. We are now living in the age of software reuse

$\to$ A fulfillment of one of the oldest promises of the OO model

**REP**. The granule of reuse, i.e. a component, can be no smaller than the granule of release

$\to$ Anything which we reuse must also be released and tracked

>**NOTE**. It is not realistic for a developer to simply write a class then claim that is reusable

* *Explain*. People who want to reuse software components cannot, and will not, do so unless those components are tracked through a release process, and are given release numbers
    * *Explain*.
        * Without release numbers, there would be no way to ensure that all the reused components are compatible with each other
        * Software developers need to know when new releases are coming, and which changes those new releases will bring

**Release process**. Must produce the appropriate notifications and release documentation so that users can make informed decisions about when and whether to integrate the new release

**Software design and architecture's perspective**. The classes and modules formed into a component must belong to a cohesive group

$\to$ The component cannot simply consist of a random hodgepodge of classes and modules. There must be some overarching theme or purpose that those modules all share
* *Another perspective*. Classes and modules grouped together into a component should be releasable together

### The common closure principle
**CCP**. An extension of SRP in component level 
* *Content*. 
    * Gather into components those classes that change for the same reasons and at the same time
    * Separate into different components those classes that change at different times and for different reasons
* *Motivation*. In most applications, maintainability is more important than reusability

    $\to$ If the code in an application must change, we would rather that all of the changes occur in one component, rather than being distributed across many components
* *Example*. If two classes are tightly bound, either physically or conceptually, that they always change together

    $\to$ They belong in the same component
* *Benefits*. Minimize the workload related to releasing, revalidating, and redeploying the software
dpeend 
**Similarity with SRP**. Gather together things which change at the same times, and for the same reasons. Separate things which change at different times or for different reasons
* *SRP*. Separate methods into diffeernt classes, if they change for different reasons
* *CCP*. Separate classes into different components, if they change for different reasons

### The common reuse principle
**CRP**. Do not force users of a component to depend on things they do not need
* *Purpose*. 
    * Help us to decide which classes and modules should be placed into a component
        * *Explain*. Classes and modules tending to be reused together belong in the same component
            * *Example*. A container class and its associated iterators
    * Help us to decide which classes should not be placed together in a component
        * *Explain*. When one component uses another, a dependency is created between the components

            $\to$ The using components may use only one class within the used component, but the using component still depends on the used component
            * *Consequence*. Everytime the used component is changed

                $\to$ The using component will likely need corresponding changes, even if no changes are necessary to it
* *Conclusion*. When we depend on a component, we want to make sure we depend on every class in that component

    $\to$ We want classes in each component are inseparable

**Relation to ISP**. Do not depend on things we do not need
* *ISP*. We should not depend on classes that have methods we do not use
* *CRP*. We should not depend on components which have classes we do not use

### The tension diagram for component cohension
**Problem**. The three principles must be balanced
* *Example*.
    * An architect who focuses on REP and CRP only will find that too many components are impacted when simple changes are made
    * An architect who focuses strongly on CCP and REP will cause too many unneeded releases to be generated

**Good architecture**. 
* Find a position in the tension triangle of component cohension, which meets the current concerns of the development team
* Be aware that those concerns will change overtime

>**NOTE**. Generally, projects tend to start with CCP and CRP, and draw from them to REP as it matures

## Component coupling
### Acyclic dependencies principle
**Acyclic dependencies principle**. Allow no cycles in the component dependency graph
* *Morning after syndrome*. When somebody stayed later than you yesterday and changed something you depend on, making your code break
    * *Scenarios*. Occur in development environments where many developers are modifying the same source files
    * *Consequence*. It is not uncommon for weeks to go by without the team being able to build a stable version of the project
        * *Explain*. Everyone keeps on changing and changing their code, trying to make it work with the last changes that someone else made
* *Solutions*. The weekly build, and the acyclic dependencies principle (ADP)

**The weekly build**. 
* *Idea*.
    1. Developers ignore each other for the first four days of the week
    2. Integrate all their changes and build the system on Friday
* *Applications*. Commonly used in medium-sized projects
* *Pros and cons*.
    * *Pros*. Allow developers to live in isolated world for 4 - 5 days
    * *Cons*. The large integration penalty is paid on Friday

        $\to$ As the project grows, it become less feasible to finish integrating the project on Friday
* *Consequence*. As the duty cycle of development versus integration decreases, the efficiency of the team decreases

    $\to$ This suffices for a time, but the integration time continues to grow with project size, leading to a crisis

#### Eliminating dependency cycles
**Eliminating dependency cycles**.
* *Idea*. 
    * *Our perspective*.
        1. Partition the development environment into releasable components

            $\to$ The components become units of work which can be the responsibility of a single developer, or a team of developers
        2. After getting a component working, they release it for use by other developers

            $\to$ They give it a release number and move it into a directory for other teams to use
        3. They continue to modify their component in their own private areas, while everyone uses the released version
    * *Our partner's perspective*. As new releases of a component are available

        $\to$ Other teams can decide whether they will immediately adopt the new release
* *Benefits*.
    * No team is at the mercy of the others
    * Changes made to one component do not need to have an immediate affect on other teams
        * *Explain*. Each team can decide for itself when to adapt its own component to new releases of the components
    * Integration happens in small increments
        * *Explain*. There is no single point in time when all developers must come together and integrate what they are doing
* *Drawback*. We must manage the dependency structure of the components to make sure that there is no cycle
    * *Explain*. There are cycles in the dependency structure

        $\to$ The morning after syndrome cannot be avoided
        * *Explain*. 
            * If a developer makes a new release of their component

                $\to$ We follow the dependency path (in dependency graph) backward
            * If there is a cycle in the graph

                $\to$ You are affecting yourself
* *Releasing the system*. The bottom-up approach is used

**Effect of a cycle in the component dependency graph**.
* Difficult to isolate components
* Unit testing and releasing become very difficult and error prone
* Build issues grow geometrically with the number of modules

**Breaking the cycle**.
* *Approach 1*. Apply the dependency inversion principle
* *Approach 2*. Introduce new nodes to the graph

### Top-down design
**Consequence of ADP**. The component structure cannot be designed from the top-down

>**NOTE**. It is not one of the first things about the system that is designed, but rather evolves as the system grows and changes

* *Common wrong understanding*. We expect that large-grained decompositions, like components, will also be high-level functional decompositions
* *Correct understanding*. Component dependency diagrams are a map to the buildability and maintainability of the applications

    $\to$ This is why they are not designed at the beginning of the project, i.e. there is no software to build or maintain
    * *Correct use of component dependency diagrams*. 
        * As more modules accumulated in the early stage of implementation and design

            $\to$ There is growing need to manage the dependencies so that the project can be developed without the "morning after syndrome"
        * We want to keep changes as localized as possible
            
            $\to$ We start paying attention to the SRP and CCP, and collocate classes which are likely to change together

**Concerns with ADP**.
* *Isolation of volatility*. 
    * *Explain*. We do not want components changing frequently and for capricious reasons to affect components that otherwise ought to stable
    * *Solution*. Use the component dependency graph to protect stable high-value components from volatile components
* *Reusable elements*. Concerned as the application continues to grow
    * *Explain*. At this point, the CRP begins to influence the composition of the components

        $\to$ Finally, as cycles appear, the ADP is applied and the component dependency graph jitters and grows

**Drawbacks of designing the component dependency structure before designing classes**.
* We would not know much about common closure
* We would be unaware of any reusable elements
* We would almost certainly create components, which produced dependency cycles

### The stable dependencies principle
**The stable dependencies principle**. Depend in the direction of stability
* *Explain*. Modules that are intended to be easy to change are not depended on by modules that are harder to change
* *Problem*. Designs cannot be completely static, some volatility is necessary if the design is to be maintained
* *Solution*. By conforming the CCP, we create components which are sensitive to certain kinds of changes but immune to others

    $\to$ Some of these components are designed to be volatile, i.e. we expect them to change
* *Dependency on volatile components*. Any component which we expect to be volatile should not be depended on by a component that is difficult to change

    $\to$ Otherwise, the volatile component will also be difficult to change

#### Stability
**Stability**. 
* *Definitions*.
    * *Webster's dictionary*. Something is stable if it is not easily moved

        $\to$ Stability is related to the amount of work required to make a change
    * *SWE's perspective*. Many factors may make a software component hard to change, e.g. its size, complexity, clarity, etc.

        $\to$ One sure way to make a software component difficult to change, is to make lots of other software components depend on it
        * *Explain*. It requires a great deal of work to reconcile any changes with all the dependent components

>**NOTE**. Stability has nothing directly to do with frequency of change

* *Reasons not to change*. Let $X$ be a stable component, then the number of good reasons not to change is the number of components depending on $X$
    * *Responsibility of component*. We say that $X$ is responsible for its depending components
    * *Independent component*. If $X$ depends on nothing, i.e. it has no external influence to make it change

        $\to$ We say it is independent
    * *Irresponsible component*. If no components depend on $X$ 

        $\to$ $X is very unstable and we say that it is irresponsible, and dependent

**Stability metrics**.
* *Idea*. Count the number of dependencies entering and leaving the component
    * *Purpose*. Compute the positional stability of the component
    * *Fan-in and fan-out*.
        * *Fan-in*. Incoming dependencies, i.e. the number of classes outside this component that depend on classes within the component
        * *Fan-out*. Outgoing dependencies, i.e. the number of classes inside this component that depend on classes outside the component
    * *Instability*. $I=\frac{\text{fan_out}}{\text{fan_in}+\text{fan_out}}\in [0,1]$
* *SDP and stability metric*. SDP says thgat the $I$ metric of a component should be larger than the $I$ metrics of the components it depends on

#### Not all components should be stable
**Component stability and system stability**. If all components in a system were maximally stable

$\to$ The system would be unchangable, which is not desired
* *Optimal design*. Some components are unstable, and some are stable, with the changable components on top of stable components

    >**NOTE**. Putting the unstable components on top of the diagram is a useful convention since any arrow pointing up is violating the SDP

**Abstract components**. Very stable, and thus, are ideal targets for less stable components to depend on

### The stable abstraction principle
**The stable abstraction principle**. A component should be as abstract as it is stable
* *Idea*. Set up a relationship between stability and abstractness
    * *Explain*. 
        * A stable component should also be abstract so that its stability does not prevent it from being extended
        * An unstable component should be concrete since its instability allows the concrete code within it to be easily changed
    * *Consequence*. If a component is stable, it should consist of interfaces and abstract classes for easy extension
        * *Explain*. Stable components that are extensible are flexible and do not overly constrain the architecture
  
**SAP and SDP amount to DIP for components**.
* *SDP*. Dependencies should run in the direction of stability
* *SAP*. Stability implies abstraction
* *DIP*. Dependencies run in the direction of abstraction

**Measuring abstraction**. The ratio of interfaces and abstract classes in a component, to the total number of classes in the component

# Appendix
## Discussion
**Top-down or bottom-up design**.
* *Top-down*. Great to describe things we know, or to re-build things we have already built
    * *Drawbacks*. We will change our mind about what the system should do while developing the system and while exploring the domain

        $\to$ We should not rely on a starting point we do not know about
    * *Application*. When the problem is well defined, with formal specifications and already known solutions
* *Local top-down*. Thinking ahead of coding a little (but not too much)
    * *Drawbacks of thinking too much*. What we are envisioning is not the real scenario

        $\to$ Global top-down when building new things is just non-sense
* *Bottom-up*. We should use this approach, unless we know 100% of the problem
* *Distilled bottom-up*. Not only build bottom up, but also shape the bricks the way we need them to be

>**NOTE**. New complex software systems are grown, not designed
>* *Explain*.
>   * The specification is fuzzy
>   * The specificaiton is wrong and self-contradictionary
>   * Cost and time estimation will be random numbers

>**NOTE**. There are huge-company projects with thousands and thousands of hours thrown into powerpoint slides and UML diagram alone
>$\to$ They invariably fail completely after burning the embrassing amounts of resources

* *Advice*. Start from bottom and go up, then our focus and attention on detail should in a sense "fade" as we are getting farther from what we have

**Top-down or bottom-up design by Uncle Bob**. We should use top-down approach, but in a different way

$\to$ We use TDD combined with evolutionary design
* *Idea*.
    1. Start from the top and define the highest abstraction levels (or local highest)

        $\to$ As soon as they are defined, we make them do useful work so that first feature is immediately working
    2. As we add more and more features, we refactor our code and evolve the design as needed, while always staying aware of SOLID principles
* *Benefits*.
    * We will not end up with too many abstraction layers
    * We will not end up low-level design that does not fit the overall architectur
