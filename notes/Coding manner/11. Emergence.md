# 11. Emergence
## Getting clean via emergent design
**Problem**. Is there any rule we can follow to create good designs

**Rules for a simple design**. These rules are ordered by the importance
* Run all the tests
* Contain no duplication
* Express the intent of the programmer
* Minimize the number of classes and methods

## *Simple design rule 1*. Runs all the tests
**Principle**. A design must produce a system which acts as intended

**Testable system**. A system which is comprehensively tested and passes all of its tests all of the time
* *Untestable system*. Not verifiable, thus should never by delopyed

**Trick**.
* Making out system testable pushes us toward a design where our classes are small and single purpose
    * *Explain*. It's easier to test classes which conform to the single responsibility principle
* Tight coupling makes it difficult to write tests

    $\to$ The more test we write, the more we use Dependent inversion principle and tools like dependency injection, interfaces, and abstraction to minimize coupling

## *Simple design rules 2 - 4*. Refactoring
**Principle**. Once we have tests, we keep our code and classes clean by incrementally refactoring the code
* *Idea*. For each few lines of code we add, we pause and reflect on the new design

    $\to$ We can clean it up and run our tests to demonstrate that we haven't broken anything
* *Explain*. Having tests eliminates the fear of breaking codes by cleaning it

**Consequence**. Apply the entire body of knowledge about good software design during the refactoring step

### No duplication
**Principle**. Duplication is the primary enemy of a well-designed system
* *Explain*. It introduces additional work, risk, and unnecessary complexity

**Forms of duplication**.
* Lines of code which look exactly alike
* Duplication in implementation
    * *Example*. Having both `size()` and `isEmpty()`

**Addressing low-level duplication**. Reuse in small (i.e. reuse in small-scale codes)
* *Explain*. Replace a duplicated few lines of code by a function or method
* *Example*.
    * *Bad practice*.
    
    ```python=
    def rotateImage(degrees):
        newImage = image_utils.getRotatedImage(image, degrees)
        image.dispose()
        image = newImage
    
    def scaleImage(newScale):
        newImage = image_utils.getScaledImage(image, newScale)
        image.dispose()
        image = newImage
    ```
    
    * Good practice:
    
    ```python=
    def rotateImage(degrees):
        replaceImage(image_utils.getRotatedImage(image, degrees))
    
    def scaleImage(newScale):
        replaceImage(image_utils.getScaledImage(image, newScale))
    
    def replaceImage(newImage):
        image.dispose()
        image = newImage
    ```

**Addressing high-level duplication**. Use template method

### Expressive
**Principle**. It's easy to write code which we understand, but hard to write code which our maintainers understand

$\to$ We should minimize the potential for defects as we introduce change
* *Explain*. The majority of the cost of a software project is in long-term maintenance

    $\to$ Expressive code can reduce defects and shrink the cost of maintenance
* *Writing expressive codes*. We can write expressive codes by
    * Choose good names
    * Keep our funcitons and classes small
    * Use standard nomenclature, e.g. pattern names in design patterns
    * Have well-written unit tests

**Convoluted code**. Code which is needlessly complex

**Tricks**:
* As the system become more complex, there is an greater opportunity for a mis-understanding

    $\to$ The code should clearly express the intent of its author
* The clearer the author can make the code, the less cost of maintenance
* The most important way to be expressive is to try
    * *Explain*. After get our code working, give sufficient thought to make the code clean before moving to the next problem

### Minimal classes and methods
**Principle**. Making our classes and methods small leads to creation of many tiny classes and methods

$\to$ We should also keep our function and class counts low

**High class and method counts**. (Sometimes) the result of pointless dogmatism
* *Explain*. We pointlessly obey some standard, not adaptively apply the standard

**Trick**. The goal is keep the overall system small while also keeping the functions and classes small

>**NOTE**. This rule is the lowest priority of the four rules of Simple Desig
