# 3. Comments
## Comment don't make up for bad code
**Principle**. Clean bad code, instead of commenting it
* *Explain*. Clear and expressive code with few comments is far better than complex code with lots of comments

## Explain ourself in code
**Principle**. Many programmers think that code makes a poor vehicle for explanation, and this is false

$\to$ Try to explain most of the intent in code, e.g. create a function which says the same thing as the comment we want to write

## Good comments
**Principle**. Only truly good comment is the comment we found a way not to write

### When to have a comment
**Legal comments**. Sometimes, we have to write certain comments for legal reasons (e.g. copyright, authorship, etc.)

>**NOTE**. Such comments shouldn't be contracts or legal tomes

**Informative comments**. Provide basic information
* *Example 1*.

```java
// Returns an instance of the Responder being tested
protected abstract Responder responderInstance();
```

* *Example 2*.

```java
//format matched kk:mm:ss EEE, MMM dd, yyyy
Pattern timeMatcher = Pattern.compile("\\d*:\\d*:\\d* \\w*, \\w* \\d*, \\d*");
```

>**NOTE**. Such comments can sometimes useful, but it's better to use function name to convey the information when possible

**Explanation of intent**. Sometimes, a comment goes beyond just useful information about the implementation and provides the intent behind decision
* *Example*.

```java
public int compareTo(Object o)
{
    if(o instanceof WikiPagePath)
    {
        WikiPagePath p = (WikiPagePath) o;
        String compressedName = StringUtil.join(names, "");
        String compressedArgumentName = StringUtil.join(p.names, "");
        return compressedName.compareTo(compressedArgumentName);
    }
    return 1; // we are greater because we are the right type.
}
```

**Clarification**. Sometimes, a comment translates the meaning of some obscure argument or return value into some readable thing
* *Example*.

```java
assertTrue(a.compareTo(a) == 0) // a == a
```

* *Usage*. When the argument or return value is part of the standard library, i.e. cannot be made clearer, or in the code we cannot alter

**Warning of consequences**. Sometimes, a comment warns other programmers about certain consequences

**TODO comments**. Sometimes, a comment tells something having to be done in the future

**Amplification**. Sometimes, a comment amplifies the importance of something which may other seem inconsequential

## Bad comments
**Mumbling**. Don't typing a comment just because we think we should or because the process requires it

$\to$ Spend time thinking to make sure it's the best comment we can write

>**NOTE**. Any comment which requires looking in another module for the meaning of that comment has failed to communiate to us and not worth the bits it consumes

**Redundant comments**. Don't write comment which isn't more informative than the code (i.e. not justify the code, or provide intent)
* *Explain*. It's not easier to read than the code, and can be less precise then the code

**Misleading comments**. Don't make any misleading comment (i.e. not precise enough to be accurate)

**Mandated comments**. It's silly to say that every function must have a javadoc (i.e. function doc) or every variable must have a comment
* *Explain*. Such comments just make the code messy and create the potential for lies and misdirection

**Journal comments**. Don't add a comment to the start of a module every time we edit the code
* *Solution*. use Github instead

**Noise comments**. Don't use comments which are nothing but noise
* *Example*.

```java
/***
 * Default constructor
 */
protected AnnualDateRule(){
}
```

**Don't use comment when we can use a function or a variable**.

**Position markers**. In general, position markers are messy and should be eliminated, especially the noisy train of slashed (below) at the and
* *Position marker example*.

```java
// Actions ////////////////////////////////
```

* *Trick*. Only use position marker when the benefits is significant, don't over-use banners

**Closing brace comments**. Don't put any comment on closing braces
* *Why people want closing brace comments*. Used for long functions with deeply nested structures
* *Solution*. shorten the functions instead

**Attributions and bylines**. There's no need to pollute the code with little bylines (e.g. `/* Added by Rick */`)
* *Explain*. Source code control systems are good at remembering who added what, when

**Commented-out code**. Don't comment out the unused codes
* *Explain*. People seeing the commented-out code won't have the courage to delete it (i.e. they think it's there for a reason and is too important to delete)
* *Solution*. Use source code control systems which remember the code for us

**HTML comments**. Don't use HTML in source code comments
* *Explain*. it's harder to read the comment

**Non-local information**. Make sure the comments describe the code it appears near

**Too much information**. Don't put interesting historical discussions or irrelevant descriptions of details into the comments

**Inobvious connection**. The connection between a comment and the code it describes should be obvious

**Function headers**. Short functions don't need much description
* *Explain*. A well-chosen name for a small function which does one thing is usually better than a comment header

**Javadocs in non-public code**. Don't use javadoc for code which isn't intended for public consumption
