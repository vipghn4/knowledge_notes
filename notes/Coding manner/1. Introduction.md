# Introduction
**Benefits of getting software right rather than just correct**.
* We do not need horders of programmers to keep it working

    $\to$ We need a fraction of the HR to create and maintain
* We do not need massive requirements documents and huge issue tracking systems
* We do not need global cube farms and 24/7 programming
* Changes are simple and rapid
* Defects are few and far between
* Effort is minimized, and functionality and flexibility are maximized

## What is design and architecture
**Design and architecture**. Almost mean the same thing
* *Architecture*. Often used in the context of something at a high level, which is divorced from the lower-level details
* *Design*. Often imply structures and decisions at a lower level

>**NOTE**. This usage is nonsensical when we look at what a real architect does

>**NOTE**. We cannot have high level design without low level design and vice versa

**The goal of good software design**. Minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system
* *Measure of design quality*. The effort required to meet the needs of the customer

**Case studies**.
* As the product grows, the number of engineering staffs increases dramatically
* Even though every release is supported by an ever-increasing number of developers, the growth of the code is approaching an asymptote

    $\to$ There should be something wrong here
    * *Explain*. Cost per line of code (LoC) increases dramatically

**The signature of a mess**.
* *Signature of a mess*. Things actually get to their ugly end when
    * Systems are thrown together in a hurry
    * The sheer number of programmers is the sole driver of output
    * Little or no thought is given to the cleanliness of the code, or the structure of the design

* *Consequence*.
    * Developers started out at nearly 100% productivity, but with each release, their productivity declined dramatically

        $\to$ After several releases, the productivity approaches zero, although everyone is working hard, without decreasing effort
    * Developers' effort gradually diverts away from features and is consumed by managing the mess

**The executive view**. The cost of each release increases exponentially

**What went wrong**.
* *Aeop's Tortoise and Hare story*. Illustrate foolishness of overconfidence
    * *Details*.
        * Slow and steady wins the race
        * The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong
        * The more haste, the less speed
    * *Implications*. Modern developers are in a similar race, and exhibit a similar overconfidence

        $\to$ They work their ass off, with their brain sleeping, i.e. they do not care about good, clean, well-designed code
        * *Explain*. The Hare was overconfident in its speed, and developers are overconfident in their ability to remain productive
* *Common fault 1*. Developers usually buy into a familiar lie: "We can clean it up later; we just have to get to market first!"

    $\to$ Things never do get cleaned up later, since the market pressure never abate
    * *Explain*. We can tons of competitors and we have to stay ahead of them by running as fast as we can

        $\to$ Developers never switch modes, going back and cleaning things up
    * *Consequence*. The mess builds, and productivity continues its asymptotic approach toward zero

        $\to$ The mess will reduce productivity to zero in a matter of months
* *Common fault 2*. Writing messy code makes them go fast in the short term, and slows them down in the long term

    $\to$ Developers are overconfident in their ability to switch modes from making messes to cleaning up messes in the future

## A table of two values
**Two values of a software system to the stackholders**. Behavior and structure

$\to$ Software developers are responsible for ensuring that both those values remain high
* *Common pitfalls*. Software developers often focus on one to the exclusion of the other

**Behavior**. Programmers are hired to make machines behave in a way making or saving money for the stakeholders
* *How developers implement behaviors*.
    * Help the stakeholders develop a functional specification, or requirements document
    * Write code which causes the stackholders' machines to satisfy those requirements
* *Common pitfalls*. Many programmers believe that is the entirety of their job, i.e. implement the requirements and fix any bugs

**Architecture**. Software was invented to be "soft", i.e. it must be easy to change
* *Explain*. When the stackholders change their minds about a feature

    $\to$ That change should be simple and easy to make
* *Difficulty in making change*. Proportional only to the scope of change, not the shape of the change
* *Changes from different views*.
    * *Stakeholders*. A stream of changes of roughly similar scope
    * *Developers*. A stream of jigsaw puzzle pieces that they must fit into a puzzle of ever-increasing complexity
        * *Explain*. Each new request is harder to fix than the last, since the shape of the system does not match the shape of the request

            $\to$ Developers often feed as if they are forced to jam square pegs into round holes
* *Root of problem*. Bad architecture, i.e. the more the architecture prefers one shape over another

    $\to$ The more likely new features will be harder and harder to fit into the structure
    * *Solution*. Make the architecture to be as shape agnostic as possible

**The greater value**. Function or architecture is more important?
* *Common answer*. These answers are wrong
    * *Answer by business managers*. Function is more important, i.e. it is more important for the software to work
    * *Answer by developers*. Often go along with managers' attitude
* *Explain*.
    * If a program works perfectly but is impossible to change, then it won't work when requirements change

        $\to$ The program will become useless
    * If a program does not work but easy to change, then we can make it work, and keep it working as requirements change

        $\to$ The program will remain contiually useful

**Eisenhower's matrix**.
* *Quote*. I have two kinds of prolems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent
* *Urgen and important parts of software*.
    * Behavior is urgent but not always particularly important
    * Architecture is important but never particularly urgent
* *Eisenhower's matrix*. Contain 4 squares, i.e.
    * *Urgent and important*. Architecture, behavior
    * *Not urgent and important*. Architecture
    * *Urgent and not important*. Behavior
    * *Not urgent and not important*
* *Common failures*. Elevating items in position 3 to position 1, i.e. separate those features that are urgent but not important from those features that truly are urgant and important
    * *Consequence*. Ignore the important architecture of the system, in favor of the unimportant features of the system

    >**NOTE**. Business managers are not equipped to evaluate the importance of architecture
    >$\to$ That is what software developers were hired to do, i.e. developers have to assert the importance of architecture over the urgency of features

**Fight for the architecture**. The development team has to struggle for what they believe to be best for the company, so do other teams
* *Effective software development team*. Ready to tackle the struggle
    * *Example*. Discuss with all other stakeholders as equals
        * *Explain*. As a software developer, we are a stakeholder
* *Software architect*. The challenge of tackling the struggle is doubly important
    * *Explain*. They are more focused on the structure of the system, than on its features and functions

        $\to$ They create an architecture allowing those features and functions to be easily developed, modified, and extended

>**NOTE**. If architecture comes last, then
>* The system will become ever more costly to develop, and
>* Eventually change will become practically impossible for parts of the system

>**NOTE**. If architecture comes last, it means the software development team did not fight hard enough for what they knew was necessary

# Appendix
## Discussion
**Facts**.
* Making messes is always slower than staying clean, no matter which time scale we use
* The only way to go fast is to go well (a simple truth of software development
