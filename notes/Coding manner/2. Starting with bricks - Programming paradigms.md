# Starting with the bricks: Programming paradigms
## Paradigms overview
### Structured programming
**Idea**. Impose discipline on direct transfer of control
* *Example*. Replace `goto` by `if/then/else` and `do/while/until`

### Object-oriented programming
**Motivation**. Function call stack frame in `ALGOL` language could be moved to a heap

$\to$ This allows local variables declared by a function to exist longer after the function returned

**Idea**. Impose discipline on indirect transfer of control

### Functional programming
>**NOTE**. This paradigms only recently begun to be adopted, but it was the first to be invented

**Motivation**. Immutability, i.e. the values of symbols do no change

$\to$ A functional language has no assignment statement

>**NOTE**. Most functional languages do, in fact, have some means to alter the value of a variable, but only under very strict discipline

**Idea**. Impose discipline on assignment

### Food for thought
**Common points of the programming paradigms**. Each of the paradigms removes capabilities from the programmer, non of them adds new capabilities
* *Explain*. Each imposes some kind of extra discipline, which is negative in its intent

    $\to$ The paradigms tell us what not to do, more than they tell us what to do
    * *Structured programming*. Remove `goto` statements
    * *Object oriented progrmming*. Remove function pointers
    * *Functional programming*. Remove assignment

**Conclusion**. How well the three paradigms align with the big three concerns of architecture, i.e. function, separation of components, and data management

## Structured programming
### Proof
**Motivation**. Programming is hard, and programmers do not do it very well
* *Explain*.
    * A program of any complexity contains too many details for human brain to manage without help
    * Overlooking just one small detail results in programs that may seem to work, but fail in surprising ways
* *Dijkstra's solution*. Apply the mathematical displine of proof
    * *Idea*. Construct a Euclidean hierarchy of postulates, theorems, corollaries, and lemmas

        $\to$ Programmers can use that hierarchy the way mathematicians do
        * *Explain*. Programmers would use proven structures, and tie them together with code that they would then prove correct themselves
    * *`goto` statement*. Djikstra then have to demonstrate the technique for writing basic proofs of simple algorithms
        * Certain uses of `goto` statements prevent modules from being decomposed recursively into smaller units

            $\to$ This prevents the use of the divide-and-conquer approach necessary for reasonable proofs
        * Other uses of `goto` did not have this problem

            $\to$ Good uses of `goto` correspond to `if/then/else` and `do/while` 
    * *Consequence*. `if/then/else` and `do/while` when combined with sequential execution were special
        * *Bohm and Jacopini's work*. Proved that all programs can be constructed from three structures: sequence, selection, and iteration

**Structured programming**. The very control structures making a module provable were the same minimum set of control structures, from which all programs can be built

$\to$ Structured programming was born
* *Dijkstra's implementations*.
    * *Proving sequential statements*. Use simple enumeration

        $\to$ The technique mathematically traced the inputs of the sequence to the outputs of the sequence
    * *Proving selection*. Use enumeration

        $\to$ Each path through the selection was enumerated, if both paths produced appropriate mathematical results, then the proof was solid
    * *Proving iteration*. Use induction
* *Consequence*. The idea that a Euclidean hierarchy of theorems could be constructed seemed reasonable

### Functional decomposition
**Functional decomposition**. Structured programming allows modules to be recursively decomposed into provable units

$\to$ Modules can be functionally decomposed
* *Consequence*. Disciplines such as structured analysis and structured design became popular in late 1970s and throughout the 1980s

    $\to$ Programmers could break down large proposed systems into modules and components, which could be further broken down into tiny provable functions

### No formal proofs
**Fact**. The proofs never came, the Euclidean hierarchy of theorems was never built, and programmers at large never saw the benefits of proving each and every little function correct

$\to$ In the end, Dijkstra's dream faded and died

**Tests**. Testing shows the presence, not the absense, of bugs
* *Explain*. A program can be proven incorrect by a test, but it cannot be proven correct

    $\to$ All that tests can do, after sufficient testing effort, is allow us to deem a program to be correct enough for our purposes
* *Consequence*. Software is like a science, i.e. we show correctness by failing to prove incorrectness, despite our best efforts

**Consequene of structured programming**. Force us to recursively decompose a program into a set of small provable functions

$\to$ We then use tests to try to prove those small provable functions incorrect

## Object oriented-programming
>**NOTE**. The basis of a good architecture is the understanding and application of the principles of object-oriented deisgn (OO)

**Definition of object-oriented (OO)**.
* *OO as the combination of data and function*. This is a very unsatisfying answer
    * *Explain*. It implies that `o.f()` is somehow different than `f(o)`
* *OO as a way to model the real world*. This is an evasive answer at best
* *OO as a combination of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism*. This is the most correct answer

### Encapsulation
**Encapsulation**. OO languages provide easy and effective encapsulation of data and function
* *Definition of encapsulation*. A line can be drawn around a cohesive set of data and functions

    $\to$ Outside of that line, the data is hidden and only some of the functions are known
* *Criticism*. Encapsulation is not unique to OO

**Perfect encapsulation in C**. Forward declare data structures and functions in header files, then implement them in implementation files

$\to$ Users never had access to the elements in those implementaiton files

* *Example*. The users of `point.h` have no access whatsoever to the members of `struct Point`

$\to$ They can call `makePoint()` and `distance()` but absolutely having no knowledge of `Point`

    ```c
    // point.h
    struct Point;
    struct Point* makePoint(double x, double y);
    double distance(struct Point *p1, struct Point *p2);
    ```

    ```c
    // point.c
    #include "point.h"
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <math.h>

    struct Point {
        double x, y;
    };

    struct Point* makePoint(double x, double y) {
        struct Point* p = malloc(sizeof(struct Point));
        p->x = x;
        p->y = y;
        return p;
    }

    double distance(struct Point* p1, struct Point* p2) {
        double dx = p1->x - p2->x;
        double dy = p1->y - p1->y;
        return sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy);
    }
    ```

>**NOTE**. C programmers used to perfect encapsulation all the time
>$\to$ In C++, the perfect encapsulation of C was broken
>* *Explain*. Member variables of a class have to be declared in the header file of that class

**Conclusion**. It is difficult to accept that OO depends on strong encapsulation

$\to$ OO does depend on the idea that programmers are well-behaved enough to not circumvent encapsulated data

### Inheritance
**Inheritance in OO**. Inheritance is simply the redeclaration of a group of variables and functions within an enclosing scope

$\to$ C programmers were able to do manually long before there was an OO language

**Common practice of inheritance prior to the advent of OO**. The following example shows how C++ implements single inheritance
* *Example*. Consider the example above, then the following code

    ```c
    // namedPoint.h
    struct NamedPoint;

    struct NamedPoint* makeNamedPoint(double x, double y, char* name);
    void setName(struct NamedPoint *np, char *name);
    char *getName(struct NamedPoint *np);
    ```

    ```c
    // namedPoint.c
    #include "namedPoint.h"
    #include <stdlib.h>

    struct NamedPoint {
        double x, y;
        char *name;
    }

    struct NamedPoint *makeNamedPoint(double x, double y, char* name) {
        struct NamedPoint *p = malloc(sizeof(struct NamedPoint));
        p->x = x, p->y = y, p->name = name;
        return p;
    }

    void setName(struct NamedPoint *np, char *name) {
        np->name = name;
    }

    char *getName(struct NamedPoint *np) {
        return np->name;
    }
    ```

    ```c
    // main.c
    #include "point.h"
    #include "namedPoint.h"
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(int ac, char** av) {
        struct NamedPoint *origin = makeNamedPoint(0.0, 0.0, "origin");
        struct NamedPoint *upperRight = makeNamedPoint(1.0, 1.0, "upperRight");
        distance((struct Point*) origin, (struct Point*) upperRight));
    }
    ```

**Conclusion**. Inheritance appeared long before OO languages were invented, OO just make inheritance (single and multiple) more convenient

$\to$ We can award no point to OO for encapsulation, and half-point for inheritance, which is not a great score

### Polymorphism
**Polymorphism**. Behavior of an object depends on its type

$\to$ Users should only care about interfaces

**The basis for all polymorphism in OO**. Use function pointers to inject methods to a struct
* *Implementation of polymorphism in C++*. 
    * *Virtual functions*. Every virtual function within a class has a pointer in a table called a `vtable`

        $\to$ All calls to virtual functions go through that table
    * *Constructor of derivatives*. Load their versions of the virtual functions into the `vtable` of the object being created
* *Conclusion*. Polymorphism is an application of pointers to functions

    >**NOTE**. Programmers have been using pointers to functions to achieve polymorphic behavior since Von Neumann architectures were first implemented in late 1940s
    >$\to$ OO has provided nothing new

**OO's role in polymorphism**. Make polymorphism much safer and much more convenient
* *Problems with explicitly using pointers to functions*. Pointers to functions are dangerous
    * *Explain*. Such use is driven by a set of manual conventions, i.e.
        * We have to remember to follow the convention to initialize those pointers
        * We have to remember to follow the convention to call all our functions through the pointers
    * *Consequence*. If any programmer fails to remember these conventions

        $\to$ The resulting bug can be devilishly hard to track down and eliminate
* *OO's role*. Eliminate the conventions and, therefore, the dangers

    $\to$ Using an OO language makes polymorphism trivial

    >**NOTE**. This fact provides an enormous power that old C programmers could only dream of

**Conclusion**. OO imposes discipline on indirect transfer of control

**The power of polymorphism**. Allow the plugin architecture to be used anywhere, for anything

### Dependency inversion
**How a software look like before the advent of polymorphism**. In a typical calling tree

$\to$ Main functions called high-level functions, which called mid-level functions, which called low-level functions
* *Effect of polymorphism*. Functions are called via interfaces

    $\to$ The source code dependency (the inheritance relationship) between the concrete class and the interface points in the opposite direction, compared to the flow of control (check out Clean architecture by Uncle Bob for details)
* *Consequence*. Any source code dependency, no matter where it is, can be inverted
    * *Explain*. Any of the source code dependencies can be turned around by inserting an interface between them
    * *Idea*. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules

        $\to$ Both should depend on abstractions, which should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstraction instead

**Benefits of DI**. Software architects working in systems written in OS languages have absolute control over the direction of all source code dependencies in the system

$\to$ They are not constrained to align those dependencies with the flow of control

>**NOTE**. This is the power that OO provides, and what OO is really about, at least from the architect's point of view

* *Usages of DI*. Rearrange the source code dependencies of the system, so that the DB and the UI depend on the business rules, rathan than other way around
    * *Explain*. The UI and the DB can be plugins to the business rules

        $\to$ The source code of the business rules never mentions the UI or the DB
    * *Consequence*. Business rules, UI, and DB can be compiled into three separate components or deployment units
    * *Benefits*. The components can be deployed separately and independently
        * The business rules can be deployed independently of the UI and the DB
        * Changes to the UI or the DB need not have any effect on the business rules

**Independent deployability**. When the source code of a component changes, only that component needs to be redeployed

**Independent developability**. If the modules in the system can be deployed independently

$\to$ They can be developed independently by different teams

## Functional programming
**Difference between Java (non-functional) and Lisp (functional)**. Assume th at we want to print the squares of the first 25 integers
* *Java*. Use a mutable variable, which is the loop variable `i` in the following code

    ```java
    public class Squint {
        public static void main(String args[]) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 25; i++)
                System.out.println(i*i);
        }
    }
    ```

* *Lisp*. Use immutable variable, i.e. `x` (in following code) is initialize but they are never modified

    ```python
    (println( # Print
        take 25( # the first 25
            map( fn[x] (* x x)) # squares
                (range) # of integers
        )
    ))
    ```

* *Conclusion*. Variables in functional languages do not vary

### Immutability and architecture
**Drawbacks of mutable variables**. All race conditions, deadlock conditions, and concurrent update problems are due to mutable variables

$\to$ All problems in concurrent applications cannot happend without mutable variables
* *Consequence*. As an architect, we should be very interested in issues of concurrency

    $\to$ We should wonder whether immutability is practicable
    * *Answer*. Immutability can be practicable, if certain compromises are made

### Segregation of mutability
**Segregation of mutability**. The application should be segregated into mutable and immutable components

$\to$ Immutable components perform their tasks in a purely functional way, without using any mutable variables
* *Mutability of the system*. The immutable components communicate with several other components which are not purely functional

    $\to$ The state of variables can be mutated

>**NOTE**. Mutating state exposes the components to all problems of concurrency
>$\to$ It is a common practice to use transactional memory to protect the mutable variables from concurrent updates and race conditions

### Event sourcing
**Motivation**. The more memory we have, the faster our machines are

$\to$ The less we need mutable state
* *Explain*. We can re-do what we have done to a variable anytime needed and store the original value of the variable, rather than storing the changed value of that variable each time there is an update to the variable
* *Drawback*. To make this scheme work forever

    $\to$ We would need infinite storage and infinite processing power to store and re-do the updates to the variable each time needed

**Event sourcing**. A strategy, wherein we store the transactions, but not the state

$\to$ When state is required, we simply apply all the transactions from the beginning of time
* *Motivation*. We do not have to make the scheme above work forever

    $\to$ We have enough storage and processing power to make the scheme work for a reasonable lifetime of the application
* *Shortcuts*. We can take shortcuts, e.g. compute and save the state every midnight

    $\to$ When the state information is required, we need compute only the transaction since midnight

**Conclusion**. If we have enough storage and processor power

$\to$ We can make our applications entirely immutable, and, therefore, entirely functional

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Science to the rescue**.
* *Science*. Scientific theories and laws cannot be proven correct

    $\to$ We can demonstrate the laws, and make measurements showing them correct to many decimal places, but we cannot prove them in term of mathematical proofs

    * *Consequence*. Science are falsifiable but not provable
        * *Explain*. 
            * Science does not work by proving statements true, but rather by proving statements false
            * Statements that we cannot prove false, after much effort, we deem to be true enough for our purposes
* *Mathematics*. The discipline of proving provable statements true

**UNIX OS requirements on IO device driver**. IO drivers must provide five standard functions, i.e. `open`, `close`, `read`, `write`, and `seek`
* *`FILE` data structure*. The IO driver for the console will define the 5 functions below, and load up a `FILE` data structure with their addresses

    ```c
    struct FILE {
        void (*open)(char* name, int mode);
        void (*close)();
        void (*read)();
        void (*write)(char);
        void (*seek)(long index, int mode);
    }
    ```

**Function pointer**. Can be used to implement dependency injection

**Transactional memory**. Treat variables in memory the same way as a database treats records on disk

$\to$ It protects those variables with a transaction- or retry-based scheme
* *Example*.
    * *Problem*. Assume we want to increase a `counter` variable by `1` using a function `inc`
    * *Procedure*. 
        * The value of `counter` is read and passed to `inc`
        * When `inc` returns, the value of `counter` is locked and compared to the value that was passed to `inc`
            * If the value is the same, then the value returned by `inc` is stored in `counter`, and the lock is released
            * Otherwise, the lock is released, and the strategy is retried from the beginning

## Discussion
**Program modularity**. According to Djikstra's idea, we should divide code into submodules, which we can apply divide-and-conquer to prove the correctness of the cod
