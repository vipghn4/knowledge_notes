# 8. Unit tests
## The three laws of Test-driven development (TDD)
**Principle**. Write unit tests first, before writing production code

**Laws of TDD**. The test and the production code are written together, with the tests is written just a few seconds ahead of the production code
* *First law*. We may not write production code until we have written a failing unit test
* *Second law*. We may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing
* *Third law*. We may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the concurrently failing test

>**NOTE**. Refer to Clean coder for more details

**Pipeline in TDD**. Repeatedly carry out these steps sequentially
* *Step 1*. Write a test (i.e. each new feature begins with writing a test)
* *Step 2*. Run all test and see if the new test fails
* *Step 3*. Write the code
* *Step 4*. Run tests
* *Step 5*. Re-factor the code

**Consequence**. We will write dozens of tests every day

$\to$ The tests, which may have the same size as the production code, can present a daunting management problem

## Keeping tests clean
**Principle**. Having quick and dirty tests is equivalent to, if not worse than, having no tests
* *Explain*. Tests must change as the production code evolves, since old tests start to fail

    $\to$ Dirty tests are harder to change

**Consequences of dirty tests**.
* If we modify the production code

    $\to$ Old tests start to fail, and the mess in the test code makes it hard to get those tests to pass again
* From release to release, the tests become the most costly part of the development process
    * Since tests are too costly, we may remove the tests from our development phase
    * Without tests, we cannot assure that our codes are running correctly

        $\to$ We lost the ability to make sure that changes to our code base worked as expected, then gradually, we start to fear making changes
    * Without making changes, we stop cleaning our production code. This makes our production code begin to rot

        $\to$ Finally, we are left with no tests, tangled and bug-riddled production code, frustrated customers, and the feeling that our testing effort had failed us

**Conclusion**. Test code is just as important as production code

### Tests enable the -ilities
**Principle**. If we don't keep the tests clean, we will lose them and lose the very thing which keep the production code flexible

**Purpose of unit tests**. Keep our code flexible, maintainable and reusable
* *Explain*.
    * If we have tests

        $\to$ We don't fear making changes to the code
    * From above, we can improve the architecture and design without fear
* *Consequence*. Having an automated suite of unit tests which cover the production code is the key to keeping our design and architecture as clean as possible

## Clean tests
**Principle**. Every test must be readable
* *Criteria for clean test*: Readability

    >**NOTE**. Readability is even more important in unit tests than it is in in production code

* *Readability*. Include clarity, simplicity, and density of expression

**Example of clean test code**.

```java=
public void testGetPageHierarchyAsXml() throws Exception {
    makePages("PageOne", "PageOne.ChildOne", "PageTwo");

    submitRequest("root", "type:pages");

    assertResponseIsXML();
    assertResponseContains(
        "<name>PageOne</name>", "<name>PageTwo</name>", "<name>ChildOne</name>"
    );
}

public void testSymbolicLinksAreNotInXmlPageHierarchy() throws Exception {
    WikiPage page = makePage("PageOne");
    makePages("PageOne.ChildOne", "PageTwo");

    addLinkTo(page, "PageTwo", "SymPage");

    submitRequest("root", "type:pages");

    assertResponseIsXML();
    assertResponseContains(
        "<name>PageOne</name>", "<name>PageTwo</name>", "<name>ChildOne</name>"
    );
    assertResponseDoesNotContain("SymPage");
}

public void testGetDataAsXml() throws Exception {
    makePageWithContent("TestPageOne", "test page");

    submitRequest("TestPageOne", "type:data");

    assertResponseIsXML();
    assertResponseContains("test page", "<Test");
}
```

**Build-operate-check pattern**.
* *Step 1*. Build up the test data
* *Step 2*. Operate on the test data
* *Step 3*. Check that the operation yielded the expected results

**Trick**.
* Tests must get right to the point, and use only the data types and functions they truly need
* Anyone reading the tests should be able to work out what they do very quickly, without being misled or overwhelmed by details

### Domain-specific testing language
**Principle**. Rather than using APIs which is used to manipulate the system

$\to$ We should build a set of functions and utilities which make use of those APIs to make the tests more convenient to write and easier to read

**Testing language**. A specialized API used by the tests
* *Purpose*. Help programmers to write tests and help those who must read those tests later
* *Developing testing API*. The testing API evolves from the continued refactoring of test code

### A dual standard
**Principle**. Testing API must be simple, succinct, and expressive (i.e. it don't need to be as efficient as production code)

**Dual standard**. There are things we might never do in a production environment which are perfectly fine, if do, in a test environment

## One assert per test
**Principle**. Every test function should have one and only one assert statement
* *Explain*. Each test should come to a single conclusion which is quick and easy to understand

>**NOTE**. Don't afraid to put more than one asserts in a test, but the number of asserts in a test ought to be minimized

**Given-when-then convention**:
* Standard convention:

```python=
def testSomething():
    givenSomething()
    whenSomethingHappen()
    thenResultShouldBeSomething()
```

* Improvement using template method pattern: put the "given" / "when" parts in the base class, and the "then" parts in different derivatives
    * Consequence: we can avoid duplication when writing tests which have the same "given" / "when" part

### Single concept per test
**Principle**. Test a single concept in each test function

## F.I.R.S.T
**Principle**. Clean tests follow following five rules
* *Fast*. Test should be fast (i.e. they should run quickly)
    * *Explain*. We don't want to run slow tests frequently
* *Independent*. Test should not depend on each other
    * *Explain*. We should be able to run each test independently and run tests in any order we like
* *Repeatable*. Tests should be repeatable in any environment (e.g. production environment, QA environment, etc.)
* *Self-validating*. Tests should have a boolean output (i.e. whether they pass or fail)
* *Timely*. Tests need to be written in a timely fashion
    * *Unit tests*. Should be written just before the production code which makes them pass

# Appendix
## Tricks and advices
**Testing in Python**: use `assert`

## Discussions
**Unit testing**: typically automated tests written and run by developers to ensure that a section of an application (i.e. unit) meets its design and behaves as intended
* Objects to test: test the followings to determine whether they are fit for use
    * Individual units of source code
    * Sets of one or more computer program modules
    * The associated control data
    * Usage procedures and operating procedures
* Units:
    * Procedural programming: an entire module, or (more commonly) an individual function or procedure
    * Object-oriented programming: an entire interface (e.g. class), but could be an individual method
* Idea: write tests first for smallest testable units, then compound behaviors between small tests to build up larger test

**Template pattern**: an abstract class exposes templates to execute its method

$\to$ Subclasses can overrid the method implementation as per nee
