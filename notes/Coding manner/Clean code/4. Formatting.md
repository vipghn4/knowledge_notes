# 4. Formatting
## Vertical formating
**Principle**. Most of the files should be less than 200 lines long, no file should be larger than 500 lines long

### The newspaper metaphor
**Principle**. Write code as writing newspaper
* *The name*. Should be simple but explanatory
    * *Explain*. Sufficient to tell whether we are in the right module or not
* *The top-most parts*. Should provide the highest-level concepts algorithms
* *The bottom-most parts*. Should provide details at lowest-level functions

### Vertical openness between concepts
**Principle**.
* *Each line*. Should represent an expression or a clause
* *Each group of lines*. Should represent a complete thought
* *Each thought*. Should be separated by blank lines

**Example**.

```java
package fitnesse.wikitext.widgets;

import java.util.regex.*;

public class BoldWidget extends ParentWidget {
    public static final String REGEXP = "'''.+?'''";
    private static final Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("'''(.+?)'''",
        Pattern.MULTILINE + Pattern.DOTALL
    );

    public BoldWidget(ParentWidget parent, String text) throws Exception {
        super(parent);
        Matcher match = pattern.matcher(text);
        match.find();
        addChildWidgets(match.group(1));
    }

    public String render() throws Exception {
        StringBuffer html = new StringBuffer("<b>");
        html.append(childHtml()).append("</b>");
        return html.toString();
    }
}
```

### Vertical density
**Principle**. The relevant codes should be close enough so that reader don't have to move their eyes too much to read the whole block

### Vertical distance
**Principle**.
* Concepts which are closely related should be kept vertically close to each other

>**NOTE**. This doesn't work for concepts which belong in separate files

* Closely related concepts shouldn't be separated into files unless we have a very good reason

**Variable declaration**. Variables should be declared as close to their usage as possible
* *Trick*. Local variables should appear at the top of each function
    * *Explain*. The functions are very short

**Instance variables**. Instance variables should be declared at the top of the class (or any well-known place), i.e. everybody should know where to see the declarations
* *Scissors rule (C++)*. Instance variables should be at the bottom
* *Java*. instance variables should be at the top

**Dependent functions**. If one function calls another, they should be vertically close, and the caller should be above the callee
* *Explain*. This is a natural flow

**Conceptual affinity**. Certain bits of code want to be near other bits
* *Principle*. the stronger conceptual affinity is, the less vertical distance between them

### Vertical ordering
**Principle**. Function call dependencies should point in the downward direction

## Horizontal formatting
**Principle**. We should never have to scroll to the right (at most 120)
* *Regular line length*. around 45 characters
* *Old Hollerith limit*. 80 characters

### Horizontal openness and density
**Principle**. Horizontal white space is used to associated things which are strongly related and disassociate things which are more weakly related

**Examples**.
* `a = b` (i.e. assignment has two distinct and major elements, thus each element should be separated)
* `def f(x)` (i.e. the function and its arguments are closely related)

### Horizontal alignment
**Principle**. Use unaligned declarations and assignments
* *Aligned declaration*.

```java
private     Socket          socket;
private     InputStream     input;
```

**Indentation**. Each level of intention is a scope, into which names can be declared, and in which declarations and executable statements are interpreted
* *Breaking indentation*. Don't break the indentation rule for should `if` statements, short `while` loops, or short functions

**Dummy scopes**. Try to avoid dummy body of `while` and `for` statement
* *Dummy body of `while` statement*.

```java
while(cap.read() != None);
```

* *Solution*. Make the semicolon more visible by indent or putting it on its own lin
