# 9. Classes
## Class organization
**Principle**. A class should begin with a list of variables followed by functions
* *Variable order*. Public static constant $\to$ private static variables $\to$ private instance variables

    >**NOTE**. There's a seldom a good reason to have a public variable

* *Function order*. Private functions called by a public function are put right after the public function itself

**Encapsulation**. We like to keep our variables and utility functions private, but sometimes we need to make the variables and utility functions accessible for a test
* *Solution*. If a test in the same package needs to call a function or access a variable

    $\to$ We'll make it protected or package scope
* *Explain*. Tests rule the world!

    >**NOTE**. We'll first look for maintaining privacy. Loosening encapsulation is always a last resort

## Classes should be small
**Principle**. Classes should be small (i.e. smaller is the primary rule when designing classes)
* *Class size measurement*. Use responsibilities (instead of counting physical lines)

**Tricks**.
* The class name should describe what responsibilities it fulfills

    $\to$ Naming is probably the first way to determine the class size
* If we cannot derive a concise name for a class then it's too large
    * *Explain*. The more ambiguous the class name, the more likely it has too many responsibilities
* We should be able to write a brief description of the class in about 25 words without using `if`, `and`, `or`, or `but`

### The single responsibility principle (SRP)
**The single responsibility principle**. A class or module should have one, and only one, reason to change (i.e. one responsibility)
* *Example*. Have a separate class named `Version` with methods below to deal with version information
    * `getMajorVersionNumber()`
    * `getMinorVersionNumber()`
    * `getBuildNumber()`
* *Explain*. If we have a set of functions `funcA()`, `funcB()` and `funcC()` where use `A` cares about `funcA()`, users `B` and `C` are defined similarly
    * If `A` asks for some changes on `funcA()`, i.e. `A` is the reason to change, and `B` complains that his functionality is affected by changes in `funcA()`

        $\to$ `funcA()` has at least two reasons to change, i.e. `A` and `B` can request for some change leading to changes in `funcA()`
    * If `A` asks for some changes on `funcA()`, i.e. `A` is the reason to change, and everybody is not affected

        $\to$ `funcA()` has only one reason to change, i.e. only `A` can request changes leading to changes in `funcA()`

**Discussion**. Many developers fear that a large number of small, single-purpose classes make it more difficult to understand the bigger picture
* *Explain*. They have to navigate from class to class to figure out how a larger piece of work gets finished
* *The primary goal in managing complexity of a sizable system*. Organize the system so that
    * A developer knows where to look to find things
    * A developer only need to understand the directly affected complexity at any given time
* *Multi-purpose classes*. Hamper us by insisting we skim through lots of things we don't need to know right now

**Objective**. We want our system to be composed of many small classes, not a few large ones
* Each small class encapsulates a single responsibility, has a single reason to change
* Each class collborates with a few others to achieve the desired system behavior

**Tricks**. Trying to identify responsibilities (reasons to change) often helps us recognize and create better abstractions in our code

### Cohesion
**Principle**.
* Classes should have a small number of instance variables
* Each of its methods manipulating one or more variables

**Cohesion**. The more variables a method manipulates, the more cohesive that method is to its class
* *Maximally cohesive class*. Each variable is used by each method

>**NOTE**. It's neither advisable nor possible to create such maximally cohesive classes

* *High cohesion*. We like cohesion to be high (i.e. the methods and variables are co-dependent and hang together as logical whole)
    * *Intuition*. Elements within one class / module should functionally belong together and do one particular thing
    * *Consequences of high cohesion*. Robustness, reliability, reusability, and understandability

>**NOTE**. Keeping functions small and parameter lists short can sometimes lead to a proliferation of instance variables which are used by a subset of methods

>$\to$ It almost always means that there's at least one class trying to get out of the larger class
>* *Solution*. Separate the variables and methods into two or more classes so that the new classes are more cohesive

### Maintaining cohesion results in many small classes
**Problem**. When extracting a small part of a function into another separable function, but the code we want to extract uses many variables declared in the original function
* *Naive solution (bad)*. Pass all of the related variables to the new function as arguments
* *Preferred solution*. Promote the related variables as instance variables of the class

$\to$ We don't have to pass any variables

**Observations**. Having many instance variables means that our classes lose cohesion (i.e. they accumulate more and more instance variables which exist solely to allow a few functions to share them)
* *Solution*. Split those few functions and related variables into a class

## Organizing for change
**Principle**. Opening up a class for modification introduces risk (i.e. any modification to the class have the potential of breaking other code in the class)

$\to$ We want to structure our systems so that we muck with as little as possible when updating them with new or changed features

**Open-closed principle**. Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
* *Ideal system*. We incorporate new features by extending the system, not by making modifications to existing code
* *Explain*. When we want to add some function to our program, extend existing classes, rather than modifying existing classes

### Isolating from change
**Principle**. A client class depending upon concrete details is at risk when those details change

$\to$ We can introduce interfaces and abstract classes to help isolate the impact of those details
* *Idea*. Develop upon an abstract class rather than a detailed class

$\to$ For using detailed class, we only have to pass instances of that class as instances of the abstract base class

**Types of classes**.
* *Concrete classes*. contain implementation details (code)
* *Abstract classes*. represent concepts only

# Appendix
## Tricks and advices
**Getting software to work and making software clean** are two very different activities

>**NOTE**. We have limited head. Thus, we focus on getting our code to work more than organization and cleanliness

* *Solution*. Maintaining a separation of concerns is as important in our programming activities as it is in our programs

    $\to$ Once the program works, we have to switch to the other concern of organization and cleanliness
* *Explain*. We should go back and break the overstuffed classes into decoupled units with single responsibilities

**Cohesion and coupling**. High cohesion correlates with loose coupling, and vice versa
* *Cohesion*. How related and focused the responsibilities of an software element are
    * *Another definition*. A measure of the degree, to which the elements of the module are functionally related

        $\to$ Inner-module dependence
* *Coupling*. How strongly a software element (e.g. class, package, etc.) is connected to other elements
    * *Another definition*. The measure of the degree of inter-dependence between the modules

        $\to$ Outer-module dependence
* *Intuition*. The program inner-module elements should be organized as clusters
    * Points within a cluster must be as close as possible
    * Points from different clusters must be as far as possible

## Concepts
**Modularization**. The process of dividing a software system into multiple independent modules, where each module works independently

**Instance variable**. A variable defined in a class, for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy (or instance)
* *Declaration*. Declared in class but outside the constructor and the method / function

    >**NOTE**: in Python, instance variables can be declared by `self.attr_name = val` in the constructor or methods

* *Acsessibility*. Instance variables are created when an object is instantiated, and are accessible to all the methods, and constructor, and block in the class
* *Instance variable and attribute*. Instance variable is a type of class attribute
    * *Explain*. Another type is class variabl
