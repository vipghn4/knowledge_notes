# 1. Meaningful names
## Use intention-revealing names
**Principle**. The name of a variable, function, or class should answer all the big questions
* *Why it exists?*
* *What it does?*
* *How it's used?*

**Implicity**. The degree to which the context isn't explicit in the code

>**NOTE**. implicity is more important than simplicity

**Examples**.
* *Bad names*. A name which reveals nothing: `int d; //elapsed time in days`
* *Good names*. `int elapsedTimeInDays;`

## Avoid disinformation
**Principle**. We must avoid false clues which obscure the meaning of code
* *Explain*. We should avoid words whose meanings vary from our intended meaning

**Information and disinformation**.
* *Information*. Spelling similar concepts similarly
* *Non-information*. Providing no clue to the author's intention
* *Disinformation*. Inconsistent spelling

**Best practice**.
* Names for very similar things sort together alphabetically
* The differences between names of different modules are very obvious

**Examples**.
* Don't refer to a grouping of accounts as `accountList` unless it's actually a `List`

    $\to$ We should use `accountGroup` or `bunchOfAccounts` or just `accounts`
* Use lower-case `L` (i.e. looks like `1`) or upper-case `O` (i.e. looks like `0`)

## Make meaningful distinctions
**Problem**. When we cannot use the same name to refer to two different things

$\to$ We change one name in an arbitrary way, which may be bad

**Principle**. If names must be different, then they should also mean something different

**Bad practices**.
* Use number-series naming (e.g. `(a1, ..., aN)`)
* Use noise words (e.g. `(ProductInfo, ProductData)`, or `(theZork, zork)`)

**Tricks**. Assume that the code is seen under no specific conventions

## Use pronounceable names
**Principle**. Make the names pronounceable
* *Explain*. A significant part of out brains is dedicated to the concept of words, which are pronounceable
* *Consequence*. Things are easier to remember and discuss

## Use searchable names
**Principle**. Use names which are easy to be searched by the editor searcher

**Tricks**.
* Single-letter names can only be used as local variables inside short methods
* The length of a name should correspond to the size of its scope
    * *Explain*. If a variable or constant may be seen or used in multiple places in a body of code
    
        $\to$ It must be given a search-friendly name

## Avoid encodings
**Principle**. Avoid encoding names
* *Explain*. Encoded names has the following disadvantages
    * Require new coders to learn the "encoding style"
    * Seldom pronounceable
    * Easy to mis-type

**Hungarian notation (HN)**. Pretty important when the compiler didn't check types (as in Python), and programmers needed a crutch to help them remember the types
* *Idea*. use the first letters of the name for the data type name
    * *Example*. `lAccountNum`, `strName`
* *Drawbacks*. 
    * Harder to change the name or type 
    * Harder to read the code
    * Encoding system will mislead the reader

**Member prefixes**. Use prefix `m_` for member variables of a class
* *Getting rid of member prefixes*.
    * Use small enough classes and functions
    * Use an editing environment which hightlights or colorizes members to make them distinct

**Interfaces and implementations**. A special case for encodings
* *Idea*. Use `IShapeFactory` to denotes the interface for `ShapeFactory`
* *Drawbacks*. Cause distraction and give too much information
* *Solution*. If we must encode either the interface or the implementation

$\to$ Encode the implementation (e.g. `ShapeFactoryImp`)

## Avoid mental mapping
**Principle**. Readers shouldn't have to mentally translate our names into other names they already know
* *Cause*. Arise from a choice to use neither problem-domain terms nor solution-domain terms

**Smart programmer vs professional programmer**. Professional programmer understands that "clarify is king"

**Tricks**. Traditional loop counters: `i, j, k` (not `l`)

## Class names
**Principle**. Classes and objects should have noun or noun-phrase names, not a verb

**Tricks**. Avoid words like `Manager`, `Processor`, etc. in the name of a class (i.e. non-informative name)

## Method names
**Principle**. 
* Methods should have verb or verb-phrase names
* Accessors, mutators, and predicates should be named for their value and prefixed with `get`, `set`, `is` (Javabean standard)

**Tricks**. When constructors are overloaded, use static factory methods with names which describe the arguments
* Example: `Image.fromarray(ndarray)` instead of `Image(ndarray)`

    >**NOTE**: we can enforce this by making the main constructor private

## Don't be cute
**Principle**. If names are too clever, they will be memorable only to people who share the author's sense of humor, or they remember the joke

$\to$ Say what we mean and mean what we say

## Pick one word per concept
**Principle**. Pick one word for one abstract concept and stick with it
* *Example*. don't use `fetch`, `retrieve`, and `get` in different methods

**Tricks**. The function names have to stand alone, and be consistent so that we can pick the correct method without any additional exploration

## Don't pun
**Principle**. Avoid using the same word for two purposes or the same term for two different ideas
* *Explain*. 
    * Following "one-word per concept" rule, we may have many classes having an `add` method
    
        $\to$ If the parameter lists and return values of the various `add` methods are semantically equivalent, all is well
    * In case semantics are different, we should use different name for each semantic meaning

## Use solution domain names
**Principle**. Use computer science (CS) terms, algorithm names, pattern names, etc. (i.e. solution domain names) for names
* *Explain*. People reading our code are programmers, not the customers

## Use problem domain names
**Principle**. When there's no solution domain name for what we're doing, use problem domain names
* *Explain*. At least the programmer maintaining the code can ask a domain expert about our code

**Tricks**. The code which has more to do with problem domain concepts should have name drawn from the problem domain

## Add meaningful context
**Principle**. Place names in context for our reader by enclosing them in well-named classes, functions, or name-spaces, or at least, use prefixes as a last resort
* *Explain*. There are a few names which are meaningful in and of themselves

**Tricks**. Use context to split functions

## Don't add gratuitous context
**Principle**. It's a bad idea to prefix every class with `GSD` in the application `Gas Station Deluxe`
* *Explain*. when we type `G` in the auto-completion key, the returned list of recommended names will be very long

**Tricks**. Shorter names are better than longer ones, so long as they are clear
* Explain: they add no more context to a name than is necessary
