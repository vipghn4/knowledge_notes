# 6. Error handling
## Use exceptions rather than return codes
**Principle**. Use exceptions rather than returning error codes
* *Explain*. Using error codes make the caller messy, i.e. the caller must check for errors immediately after the call, this is easy to forget

**Historical use of error flags**. When there's no exception mechanism

$\to$ We set an error flag or return an error code that the function caller could check

## Write try-catch-finally statement first
**Principle**. Start with a `try`-`catch`-`finally` statement when writing code which could throw exceptions

$\to$ This defines what the user of that code should expect, no matter what goes wrong with the code in the `try` block

**Program scope with `try-catch-finally`**. Exceptions define a scope within the program
* *Explain*. When we execute code in `try` portion, we are stating that execution can abort at any point and then resume at `catch`
    * *`try` block*. Act as the transaction
    * *`catch` block*. Used to make the program terminate in a consistent state no matter what

**Trick**. Write tests which force exceptions, then add behavior to the handler to satisfy the tests

## Use unchecked exceptions
**Principle**. Use unchecked exceptions

**Checked and unchecked exceptions**.
* *Checked exceptions*. Exceptions defined after `throws` keyword in Java
    * *Rule*.
        * The signature of every method must list all of the exceptions it could pass to its caller
        * The caller must `catch` the exception or `throws` it
    * *Price of checked exception*. The open / closed principle
        * *Explain*.
            * If we throw a checked exception from a method and the `catch` is several levels above

                $\to$ We must declare the exception in the signature of each method between us and the `catch`
            * Thus, the changed modules must be rebuilt and redeployed even nothing they care about changed
* *Unchecked exceptions*. Exceptions not defined after `throws` keyword in Java

## Provide context with exceptions
**Principle**. Each thrown exception should provide enough context to determine the source and location of an error
* *Idea*.
    * Create informative error messages and pass them along with the exceptions
    * Mention the operation that failed and the type of failure

## Define exception classes in terms of a caller's needs
**Principle**. When we define exception classes in an application, the most important concern should be "how they are caught"

$\to$ We can wrap up several exceptions, which can be caught similarly, into an exception which meets the caller's needs
* *Exception class*. `DeviceResponseException`, `GMXError`, etc. in the following code

    ```java
    ACMEPort port = new ACMEPort(12);
    try {
        port.open();
    } catch (DeviceResponseException e) {
        reportPortError(e);
        logger.log("Device response exception", e);
    } catch (ATM1212UnlockedException e) {
        reportPortError(e);
        logger.log("Unlock exception", e);
    } catch (GMXError e) {
        reportPortError(e);
        logger.log("Device response exception");
    } finally {
        ...
    }
    ```

**Trick**.
* Wrapping third-party APIs is a best practice
* When we wrap a third-party API, we minimize our dependencies upon it
* Often a single exception class is fine for a particular area of code
    * *Explain*. The informative sent with the exception can distinguish the errors
* Only use different exception classes if there are times we want to catch one exception and allow the others to pass through

## Define the normal flow
**Principle**. Use special-case object to reduce the exception throws in the code
* *Explain*. Avoid pushing error detection to the edges of the program

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ The program should be in its normal flow

**Example**.
* *Bad practice*.

    ```java
    try {
        MealExpenses expenses = expenseReportDAO.getMeals(employee.getID());
        m_total += expenses.getTotal();
    } catch(MealExpensesNotFound e) {
        m_total += getMealPerDiem();
    }
    ```
* *Good practice*.

    ```java
    MealExpenses expenses = expenseReportDAO.getMeals(employee.getID());
    m_total += expenses.getTotal();
    //-----------------------------
    public class PerDiemMealExpenses implements MealExpenses {
        public int getTotal() {
            // return the per diem default
        }
    }
    ```

**Keyword**. Special-case pattern

## Don't return null
**Principle**. Returning `null` is the first thing which invites errors
* *Explain*. When we return `null`, we are creating work for ourselves and burden on our callers (i.e. force it to have `null` checks)
* *Solution*.
    * *Approach 1*. Throw an exception
    * *Approach 2*. Return a special-case object

**Example**.
* *Bad code*.

    ```java
    List<Employee> employees = getEmployees();
    if (employees != null) {
        for(Employee e : employees) {
            totalPay += e.getPay();
        }
    }
    ```

* *Good code*,

    ```java
    public List<Employee> getEmployees() {
        if( .. there are no employees .. )
            return Collections.emptyList();
    }

    ...

    List<Employee> employees = getEmployees();
    for(Employee e : employees) {
        totalPay += e.getPay();
    }
    ```

## Don't pass null
**Principle**. Returning `null` from methods is bad, but passing `null` into methods is worse

$\to$ Unless the API expects us to pass `null`, avoid it whenever possible
* *Explain*. There's no good way to deal with a `null` which is passed by a caller accidentally

>**NOTE**. When we pass `null`, we can code with the knowledge that a `null` in an argument list is an indicator of a problem

# Appendix
## Discussions
**Catch and throw exceptions (Java)**,
* `try`: the block contains set of statements where an exception can occur
* `catch`: used to handle the uncertain condition of `try` block
* `throw` (i.e. `raise` in Python): used to transfer control from `try` block to `catch` block
* `throws`: specify exceptions which a method can throw to the caller and doesn't handle itself (i.e. checked exception)
* `finally`: executed after catch block (i.e. put some common code when there are multiple catch block
