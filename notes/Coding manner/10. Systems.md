# 10. Systems
## How would we build a software
**Principle**. Have teams of people who manage particular parts of the software
* Some of those people focus on the big picture
* Some focus on the details

## Separate constructing a system from using it
**Motivation**. Construction is a very different process from using

**Principle**. Software systems should separate construction process from runtime logic, which takes over after startup
* *Example*. 
    * People living in a house don't have to care about how the house was built
    * While living in a house, if one wants to have a chair, one just buys it without having to know how the chair was made
* *Explain*. If the startup process is scattered across the application

    $\to$ There will be little modularity and significant duplication (i.e. we should completely finish the house before living in it)
* Good practice: modularize startup process separately from the normal runtime logic

**Example codes**.
* *Bad practice*. Startup process is mixed with runtime logic
    
    ```java=
    public Service getService() {
        if (service == null)
            service = new MyServiceImpl(...); // Good enough default for most cases?
        return service;
    }
    ```
    
    >**NOTE**. See lazy initialization in Appendix for more details

**Separation of concerns**. One of the oldest and most important design techniques
* *Description*. We should separate a program into distinct sections such that each section addresses a separate concern
* *Concern*. A set of information which affects the code of a computer program
    * *Example*.
        * The details of the hardware for an application
        * The name of which class to instantiate

>**NOTE**. The startup process is a concern which any application must address

>**NOTE**. If we want to build a well-formed and robust system, we should never let little, convenient idioms lead to modularity breakdown

### Separation of main
**Principle**. To separte construction from use, move all aspects of construction to `main`, or modules called by `main`, and design the rest of the system assuming that all objects has been constructed and wired appropriately
* *Flow*.
    * *Step 1*. `main` builds the objects necessary for the system
    * *Step 2*. `main` passes the objects to the application
    * *Step 3*. The application uses the objects during runtime
* *Consequence*. The application has no knowledge of `main` or of the construction process

### Factories
**Principle**. Use abstract factory when we need to make the application responsible for when an object gets created
* *Explain*. We want to hide the construction logic from the application

    $\to$ The application just goes as if things are constructed and wired properly

### Dependency injection (DI)
**Inversion of Control (IoC)**. Move secondary responsibilities from an object to other object which are dedicated to the purpose, i.e. support SRP
* *IoC in dependency management*. An object shouldn't take responsibility for instantiating dependencies itself
    * *Idea*. Pass the responsibility to another "authoritative" mechanism (i.e. invert the control)
    * *Explain*. Setup is a global concern
    
        $\to$ This authoritative mechanism will usually be either `main` or a special-purpose container
    * *Dependency (in this context)*. An object which can be used (e.g. a service)

**Dependency injection**. The class is completely passive in resolving its dependencies
* *Idea*. The class provides setter methods or constructor arguments (or both) which are used to inject the dependencies (see example below)
* *Pipeline of the construction process*.
    * *Step 1*. DI container instantiates the required objects (usually on demand)
    * *Step 2*. DI container uses the constructor arguments or setter methods provided to wire together the dependencies
* *Specifying the dependent objects*. Use a configuration file or programmatically in a special-purpose construction module

**Example**.
* *Object instantiates object*. `MyApp` have a hard-code dependency with `EmailService` thus it's hard for us to switch to some other advanced email service in the future

```python=
class MyApp:
    def __init__(self):
        self.email = EmailService()
    
    def processMessages(msg):
        self.email.sendEmail(msg)
```

* *Good example*. `MyApp` use objects created from outside, which is easy to change and update

```python=
class MyApp:
    def __init__(self, emailService):
        self.email = emailService
```

## Scaling up
**Principle**. We should implement only today's stories, then refactor and expand the system to implement new stories tomorrow

$\to$ This is the essence of iterative and incremental agility
* *Explain*. We don't build a large system from the first time, since
    * We cannot justify the expense of a six-lane highway through the middle of a small town which anticipates growth
    * We wouldn't want such a road through own town

**Growing from simple to complex software system**. Software systems can grow incrementally if we maintain the proper separation of concerns

### Cross-cutting concerns
**Cross-cutting concern**. Aspects of a program which affect other concerns

>**NOTE**. These concerns often cannot be cleanly decomposed from the rest of the system in both the design and implementation

* *Example*. Persistence, code mobility, data validation, etc.
    * Consider persistence, we have to concern about using a particular DBMS versus flat files, following certain naming conventions for tables and columns, etc.
* *Consequences of cross-cutting concerns*. We have to spread essentially the same code which implements the persistence strategy across many objects
* *Good practice*. The cross-cutting concern should be modular

**Aspect-oriented programming (AOP)**. A general-purpose approach to storing modularity of cross-cutting concerns

$\to$ This improves modularity
* *Idea*. Adding additional behavior to the existing code without modifying the code via "aspects"
* *Aspects*. Modular constructs specifying which points in the system should have their behavior modified in some consistent way to support a particular concern
* *Example of AOP*. 
    * *Step 1*. Declare which objects and attributes (or patterns) should be persisted
    * *Step 2*. Delegate the persistence tasks to the persistence framework
* *AOP in Python*. Use decorator
    * *Bad example (without AOP)*. We want to know execution time of each method in class `Car`
    
    ```python=
    class Car:
        def start(self):
            start = time.time()
            ...
            print(time.time() - start)
        
        def run(self):
            start = time.time()
            ...
            print(time.time() - start)
    ```
    
    * *Good example (with AOP)*. Use decorator to print execution time to reduce duplication
    
    ```python=
    class Car:
        @runtimeLogger
        def start(self):
            ...

        @runtimeLogger
        def run(self):
            ...
    ```

## Test drive system architecture
**Principle**. An optimal system consists of modularized domains of concern, each of which is implemented with an plain-old Java (or other) objects
* *Integrating different domains*. Integrated with minimally invasive Aspects or Aspect-like tools
* *Test-driven architecture*. Such architecture can be test-driven, just like the code

**Architecture evolution**. We can evolve the architecture  from simple to sophisticated, as needed, by adopting new technologies on demand

>**NOTE**. We should avoid BDUF, i.e. big design up front (see Appendix)

>**NOTE**. Building architects have to do BDUF since it is not feasible to make radical architectural changes to a large physical structure once construction is well underway

* *Principle*. If the structure of the software separates its concerns effectively

    $\to$ It is economically feasible to make radical change on the software architecture
* *Consequence*. We can start a project rudderless, but we must maintain the ability to change course in response to evolving circumstances

## Optimize decision making
**Principle**. Modularity and separation of concerns makes decentralized management and decision making possible
* *Explain*. In a sufficiently large system, no one can make all the decisions

**Trick**.
* Give responsibilities to the most qualified persons
* It's best to postpone decisions until the last possible moment
    * *Explain*. It's not lazy or irresponsible, it lets us make informed choices with the best possible information

## Use standards wisely, when they add demonstrable value
**Principle**.
* *Advantage of standards*. Easier to 
    * Re-use ideas and components
    * Recruit people with relevant experience
    * Encapsulate good ideas
    * Write components together
* *Disadvantage of standards*. 
    * Creating standards can sometimes take too long for industry to wait
    * Some standards lose touch with the real needs of the adopters they are intended to serve

**Trick**. Watch how buildings are constructed to have good insight in system designs
* *Explain*. construction is a mature industry with highly optimized parts, methods, and standards which have evolved under pressure for centuries

## Systems need domain-specific languages
**Domain-specific languages**. SEparate, small scripting languages or APIs in standard languages which permit code to be written, so that it reads like a structured form of prose which a domain expert may write
* *Good DSL*. Minimize the communication gap between a domain concept and the code implementing it

    $\to$ Reduce risk that we will incorrectly translate the domain into the implementation

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Construction process**. Also called *start-up process*. When application objects are constructed and dependencies are wired

**Lazy initialization / evaluation idiom**. Initialize objects lazily, e.g.

```java=
public Service getService() {
    if (service == null)
        service = new MyServiceImpl(...); // Good enough default for most cases?
    return service;
}
```

* *Upsides*.
    * We do not incur the overhead of construction, unless we actually use the object
    * Our startup time can be faster
    * We can ensure that `null` is never returned
* *Downsides*.
    * We hard-code dependency on `MyServiceImpl` and everything its constructor requires

        $\to$ We cannot compile without resolving these dependencies, even if we never actually use an object of this type at runtime
    * We do not know whether `MyServiceImpl` is the right object in all cases
* *Consequence*. Testing can be a problem
    * *Explain*.
        * If `MyServiceImpl` is a heavyweight object
        
            $\to$ We will need to make sure that an test double or mock object gets assigned to the service field, before this method is called during testing
        * Since we have construction logic mixed in with normal runtime processing

            $\to$ We must test all execution paths. This means we are violating SRP in a small way

**Big design up front (BDUF)**. BDUF is harmful since it inhibits adapting to change
* *Explain*. 
    * Due to the psychological resistance to discarding prior effort
    * Due to the way architecture choices influence subsequent thinking about the design

**Dependency inversion principle (SOLID)**.
* *Statement*.
    * High-level modules shouldn't depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstraction
    * Interface (abstraction) shouldn't depend on details, but opposite. Classes communicate via interfaces, not implementations
* *Dependency*. High-level modules uses low-level modules

    $\to$ Changes in low-level modules lead to changes in high-level modules
* *Idea of dependency inversion*. If both high-level and low-level modules depend on abstraction

    $\to$ We can change low-level modules without changing high-level modules

**Dependency injection**. Pass a dependency (a service) into the object (a client) which would use it
* *Intuition*. Instead of a client specifying which service it will use, something tells the client what service to use
* *Principles*.
    * Modules communicate via interfaces (i.e. high-level modules uses low-level modules via interface)
    * Instantiating low-level modules will be carried out by DI container
    * The association of modules and interfaces are written in a config file
    * DI is used to reduce the module dependencies
* *Motivation*. Creating objects directly within the class, which requires the objects, is inflexible
    * *Consequences*. 
        * It commits the class to a particular objects 
        * It makes it impossible to change the instantiation later independently from the class
        * It stops the class from being re-usable if ohter objects are required
        * It makes the class hard to test since real objects can't be replaced with mock objects
    * Solution: move the instantiation to a factory object as in abstract factory pattern

**Plain-old Java object (POJO)**. A Java object not bound by any restriction other than those forced by Java language
* *Rule*. a POJO shouldn't have to
    * Extend prespecified classes (e.g. `public class Foo extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet { ...`)
    * Implement prespecified interfaces (e.g. `public class Bar implements javax.ejb.EntityBean { ...`)
    * Contain prespecified annotations (e.g. `@javax.persistence.Entity public class Baz { ...`)
* Example:

```java=
public class MyBean {
    private String someProperty;

    public String getSomeProperty() {
         return someProperty;
    }
}
