# 7. Boundaries
## Using third party code
**Interface provider and users**.
* *Interface provider*. Develop the interface for broad applicability
    * *Explain*. The interface should be used in many environments and appeal to wide audience
* *Interface user*. Want an interface which is focused on their particular needs

**Consequences of flexible interfaces**. Interface users must take care of the interface

$\to$ This makes the code dirty (i.e. taking care of the interface don't help telling the story)
* *Example*.
    * We want elements of a Python list to have a particular data type but its elements can be of any type

        $\to$ Each time we get an element from the list, which is added by another user, we have to convert it to the desired data type
    * We don't want to remove any element from a list but Python list has `remove()`

        $\to$ We must prevent other users from using `remove()`

**Using third-party code**.
* Wrap the API into a tailored and constrained class, or close family of classes

    $\to$ We don't have to take care of the API's wideness anymore
* Avoid returning the generic objects from, or accepting them as arguments to, public APIs

## Exploring and learning boundaries
**Principle**. Write tests to explore our understanding of the third-party code before using them
* *Explain*. Learning the third-party code is hard, integrating the third-party code is hard too

    $\to$ Doing both at the same time is doubly hard

**Bad practice**. Read the document of the third-party API, then experiment and try out the new stuff in the production code

## Learning tests are better than free
**Principle**. Learning tests end up costing nothing

$\to$ We had to learn the API anyway, and writing those tests was an easy and isolated way to get that knowledge
* *Explain*. Learning tests were precise experiments which helped increase our understanding

**Trick**.
* When there are new releases of the third-party package

    $\to$ We run the learning tests to see whether there are behavioral differences
* A clean boundary should be supported by a set of outbound tests which exercise the interface the same way the production code does
* Without boundary tests, we might be tempted to stay with the old version longer than we should

## Clean boundaries
**Principle**. When we use third-party code

$\to$ Special care must be taken to make future change isn't too costly

**Trick**.
* Have clear separation with the third-party code
* Have tests which define expectations
* Avoid letting too much of our code know about the third-party particulars
    * *Explain*. It's better to depend on something we control than something we don't
* Wrap the third-party API or use adapter pattern to convert from our perfect interface to the provided interface

# Appendix
## Tricks and advices
**Advantage of using third-party codes**. We can get more functionality done in less time

$\to$ We should exploit them as much as we ca
