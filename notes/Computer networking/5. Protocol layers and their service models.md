**Layered architecture in computer networking**. A packet is shipped from source host to destination host in the Internet
* *Service*. Each layer, combined with layers below it, implements some functionality
* *Service production*. Each layer provides its service by
    * Perform certain actions within that layer, and
    * Use the services of the layer directly below it

**Benefits of layered architectures**. Allow us to discuss well-defined, specific part of a large and complex system

$\to$ This is of considerable value by providing modularity, making it much easier to change the implementation of the service provided by the layer
* *Explain*. As long as the layer provides the the same service to the layer above it, and uses the same services from the layer below it

    $\to$ The remainder of the system remains unchanged when a layer's implementation is changed
* *Motivation*. For large and complex systems, which are constantly being updated, the ability to change the implementation of a service without affecting other components of the system is another important advantage of layering

## Protocol layering
**Protocol layers**. To provide structure to the design of network protocols, network designers organize protocol, and network hardware and software implementing the protocols, in layers

$\to$ Each protocol belongs to one of the layers
* *Layer service model*. A layer offers to the layer above services, which is called the service model of the layer
* *Drawback*. 
    * One layer may duplicate lower-layer functionality
        * *Example*. Many protocol stacks provide error recovery on both a per-link basis and an end-to-end basis
    * Functionality at one layer may need information, e.g. a time-stamp value, which is present only in another layer

        $\to$ This violates the separation of layers

**Common networking layers**.
* *Five-layer Internet protocol stack*. Consist of application layer, transport layer, network layer, link layer, and physical layer
* *Seven-layer ISO OSI reference model*. Consist of application layer, presentation layer, session layer, transport layer, network layer, link layer, physical layer
* *Layer implementation*. Can be implemented in software, hardware, or in a combination of the two
    * *Application-layer protocols*. Almost always implemented in software in end systems
    * *Transport-layer protocols*. The same as application-layer protocols
    * *Network layer protocols*. Often a mixed implementation of hardware and software
    * *Physical and data link layers' protocols*. Typically implemented in a network interface card (NIC) assoicated with the given link
        * *Explain*. They are responsible for handling communication over a specific link

**Protocol stack**. The protocols of the various layers when taken together

### Application layer
**Application layer**. Where the network applications and their application-layer protocols reside
* *Example protocols*. 
    * HTTP, i.e. provides for Web document request and transfer 
    * SMTP, i.e. provides for transfer of e-mail messages
    * FTP, i.e. provides for the transfer of files between two end systems
    * DNS, i.e. provides for hostname-to-IP-address translation

**Message**. An application-layer protocol is distributed over multiple end systems, with the application in one end system using the protocol to exchange packets of information with the application in another end system

$\to$ This packet of information is refered as a message

### Transport layer
**Transport layer**. The Internet's transport layer transports application-layer messages between application endpoints
* *Transport protocols in the Internet*. TCP and UDP
    * *TCP*. Provide a connection-oriented service to its applications, including 
        * Guaranteed delivery of application-layer messages to the destination, and flow control
        * Breaking long messages into shorter segments
        * Congestion-control mechanism, i.e. a source throttles its transmission rate when the network is congested
    * *UDP*. Provide a connectionless service to its applications

        $\to$ This is a no-frills service which provides no reliability, no flow control, and no congestion control

**Segment**. A transport-layer packet

### Network layer
**Network layer**. Responsible for moving network-layer packets from one host to another
* *Idea*. 
    1. The transport-layer protocol, e.g. TCP or UDP, in a source host passes a transport-layer segment and a destination address to the network layer
        
        $\to$ Just as we give the postal service a letter with a destination address
    2. The network layer then provides the service of delivering the segment to the transport layer in the destination host

**Network-layer protocols**.
* *IP protocol*. Included in the Internet's network layer, to define the fields in the datagram, as well as how the end systems and routers act on these fields

    >**NOTE**. There is only one IP protocol, and all Internet components having a network layer must run the IP protocol

* *Routing protcols*. Provided by the Internet's network layer to determine the routes, which datagrams take between sources and destinations

    >**NOTE**. The Internet has many routing protocols

**IP layer**. Although the network layer contains both the IP protocol and numerous routing protocols

$\to$ It is often simply referred to as the IP protocol, reflecting that IP is the glue binding the Internet together

**Datagrams**. A network-layer packet

### Link layer
**Link layer**. The Internet's network layer routes a datagram through a series of routers between the source and destination

$\to$ To move a packet from one node, e.g. host or router, to another, the network layer relies on the services of the link layer
* *Idea*. At each node, the network layer passes the datagram down the link layer, which delivers the datagram to the next node along the route

    $\to$ At this next node, the link layer passes the datagram up to the network layer
* *Example of link-layer protocols*. Ethernet, WiFI, and cable access network's DOCSIS protocol

**Services provided by the link layer**. Depend on the specific link-layer protocol employed over the link
* *Example*. Some link-layer protocols provide reliable delivery, from transmitting node, over one link, to receivig node

**Datagram handling**. Datagrams typically need to traverse several links to travel from source to destination

$\to$ A datagram may be handled by different link-layer protocols at different links along its route
* *Example*. A datagram may be handled by Ethernet on one link and by PPP on the next link

**Frames**. A link-layer information packet

### Physical layer
**Physical layer**. The job of the link layer is to move entire frames from one network element to adjacent network element

$\to$ The job of the physcail layer is to move the individual bits within the frame from one node to the next
* *Physical-layer protocols*. Link-dependent and depend on the actual transmission medium of the link, e.g. twisted-pair copper wire, single-mode fiber optics

### The OSI model
**OSI model**. Proposed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in the late 1970s, that computer networks by organized around seven layers, called the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
* *Purposes*. For education only

**Additional layers in OSI model**.
* *Presentation layer*. Provide services which allow communicating applications to interpret the meaning of data exchanged
    * *Provided services*. Data compression, data encryption, and data description
* *Session layer*. Provide for delimiting and synchronization of data exchange, including the means to build a checkpointing and recovery scheme

**Why OSI model is not used**. It is up to the application developer to decide if a service is important

$\to$ If the service is important, it is up to the developer to build that functionality into the application

## Encapsulation
**Routers and link-layer switches**. Both are packet switches, which organize their networking hardware and software into layers, but they do not implement all of the layers in the protocol stack

$\to$ They typically implement only the bottom layers

    <figcaption>Hosts, routers, and link-layer switches</figcaption>
</div>

* *Link layer switches*. Implement only link layer and physical layer
* *Routers*. Implement only network layer, link layer, and physical layer

    $\to$ Routers are capable of implementing the IP protocol, while link-layer switches cannot

**Concept of encapsulation**.
* *Encapsulation in protocol stack*. 
    1. At the sending host, an application-layer message $M$ is passed to the transport layer
    2. The transport layer takes the message and appends additional information, i.e. transport-layer header information $H_t$, which will be used by the receiver-side transport layer

        $\to$ The application-layer message and the transport-layer header information constitute the transport-layer segment
        * *Consequence*. The transport-layer segment thus encapsulates the application-layer message
        * *Purposes*. The added information may include information to
            * Allow the receiver-side transport layer to deliver the message up to the appropriate applciation
            * Allow the receiver to determine whether bits in the message have bene changed in route, via error-deteciton bits
    3. The transport layer then passes the segment to the network layer, which adds network-layer header inforamtion $H_n$, e.g. source and destination end system addresses

        $\to$ This creates a network-layer datagram
    4. The datagram is passed to the link layer, which add its own link-layer header information and create a link-layer frame
* *Conclusion*. At each layer, a packet has two types of fields, i.e. header fields and a payload field
    * *Payload*. Typically a packet from the layer above

>**NOTE**. The process of encapsulation can be more complex than described above, e.g. a large message may be divided into mutiple transport-layer segments, which may be divided further into multiple network-layer datagrams
