# The network core
## Packet switching
**Messages**. In a network application, end systems exchange messages with each other
* *Message content*. Contain anything the application designer wants
* *Usage*. Perform a control function, or can contain data, e.g. email message, an image, etc.

**Message transmission**. 
* *Packets*. To send a message from a source end system to a destination end system
    
    $\to$ The source breaks long messages into smaller chunks of data known as *packets*
* *Packet switches*. Each packet travels through communication links and packet switches, for which there are two predominant types, routers and link-layer switches
* *Transmission rate*. Packets are transmitted over each communication link at a rate equal to the full transmission rate of the link
    * *Formal*. If a source end system or a packet switch is sending a packet of $L$ bits over a link with transmission rate $R$ bits/sec

        $\to$ The time to transmit the packet is $L/R$ seconds

### Store-and-forward transmission
**Store-and-forward transmission**. Most packet switches use store-and-forward transmission at the inputs to the link
* *Idea*. The packet switch must receive the entire packet before it can begin to trasmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link

    </div>

* *Implementation*. A router will typically have many incident links, since its job is to switch an incoming packet onto an outgoing link
    * If at that time, only a proportion of a packet come to the router, the router cannot transmit the bits it received

        $\to$ It must buffer, i.e. store, the packet's bits
    * Only after the router has received all of the packet's bits, it can begin to transmit, i.e. forward, the packet onto the outbound link
* *Motivation*. Routers need to receive, store, and process the entire packet before forwarding

**End-to-end delay of packet transmission**. The time elapses from when the source begins to send the first packet, until the destination has received all packets
* *Scenario of interest*. Consider a path of $N$ links, each of rate $R$ and $L$ is the size of the packet (in bits)
* *Formula*. $d_\text{end-to-end} = N \frac{L}{R}$

### Queuing delays and packet loss

</div>

**Packet switch links**. Each packet switch has multiple links attached to it
* *Output buffer*. For each attached link, the packet switch has an output buffer, i.e. output queue, storing packets which the router is about to send into that link
    
    >**NOTE**. Output buffers play a key role in packet switching

    * *Functionality*. If an arriving packet needs to be transmitted onto a link but finds the link busy with the transmission of another packet

        $\to$ The arriving packet must wait in the output buffer
    * *Analogue cases*. Data buffer in I/O modules, and buffer in GstElement
    * *Time delay*. Packets suffer output buffer queuing delays, in addition to store-and-forward delays
* *Packet loss*. Since the amount of buffer space is finite, an arriving packet may find that the buffer is completely full with other packets waiting for transmission

    $\to$ Packet loss will occur, either the arriving packet or one of the already-queued packets will be dropped

### Forwarding tables and routing protocols
**Internet Protocol (IP) address and forwarding table**. Every end system has an address called IP address
* *IP address structure*. IP address has a hierarchical structure, as with postal addresses
* *Forwarding table*. Each router has a forwarding table mapping destination addresses, or portions of the destination addresses, to that router's outbound links
* *Packet rounting procedure*. When a source end system wants to send a packet to a destination end system
    1. The source includes the destination's IP address in the packet's header
    2. When the packet arrives at a router in the network, the router examines a portion of the packet's destination address
        * *Explain*. The router examines the address and searches its forwarding table, using this address, to find the appropriate outbound link
    3. The router then forwards the packet to an adjacent router, by directing the packet to the searched outbound link

**Routing protocols**. The Internet has a number of special routing protocols which are used to automatically set the forwarding tables

## Circuit switching
**Two fundamental approaches to moving data through a network of links and switches**. Circuit switching and packet switching

**Circuit-switched networks**. The resources needed along a path, e.g. buffers, link transmission rate, etc. to provide for communication between the end systems are reserved for the duration of the communication session between end systems

$\to$ This is in contrast with packet-switched networks, where resources are not reserved

<div style="text-align:center">

    <figcaption>A simple circuit-switched network</figcaption>
</div>

* *Consequence of packet-switched networks*. A session's messages use the resource on demand, and may have to wait, i.e. queueing, for access to a communication link
* *Example*. Traditional telephone networks
    * *Sending information to another over a telephone network*. The network must establish a connection between the sender and the receiver

        $\to$ This is a bona fide connection, for which the switches on the path between the sender and receiver maintain connection state for that connection
* *Circuit*. In the jargon of telephony, this connection is called a circuit

    $\to$ When the network establishes the circuit, it also reserves a constant transmission rate in the network's links for the duration of the connection
* *Consequence of circuit-switched networks*. The sender can transfer the data to the receiver at the guaranteed constant rate

**Connection links**. Each connection link may have multiple circuits, so that each link can support multiple simultaneous connections
* *Communication prepartion procedure*. When two hosts want to communicate
    
    $\to$ The network establishes a dedicated end-to-end connection between the two hosts

### Multiplexing in circuit-switched networks
**Circuit implementation**. A circuit in a link is implemented with either frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) or time-division multiplexing (TDM)

<div style="text-align:center">

    <figcaption>FDM and TDM</figcaption>
</div>

* *FDM*. The frequency spectrum of a link is divded up among the connections established across the link
    * *Explain*. The link dedicates a frequency band to each connection for the durection of the connection
        * *Example*. 
            * Telephone network frequency band typically has a width of 4kHz
            * FM radio stations use FDM to share the frequency spectrum between 88 MHz and 108 MHz
    * *Bandwidth*. The width of the band
* *TDM link*. Time is divided into frames of fixed duration, and each frame is divided into a fixed number of time slots
    * *Explain*. The link dedicates one time slot in every frame for each connection

**Transmission time**. The transmission time is independent of the number of links

### Packet switching versus circuit switching
**Drawbacks of methods**. 
* *Packet switching*.
    * *Pros*. 
        * It offers better sharing of transmission capacity than circuit switching
        * It is simpler, more efficient, and less costly to implement than circuit switching 
    * *Cons*. Not suitable for real-time services, due to its variable and unpredictable end-to-end delays
* *Circuit switching drawbacks*. Proponents of packet switching alwasy argued that
    * Circuit switching is wasteful since the dedicated circuits are idle during silent periods
    * Establishing end-to-end circuits and reserving end-to-end transmission capacity is complicated and requires complex signaling software to coordinate the operation of the swtiches along the end-to-end path

**Efficiency of packet switching**. There are two scenarios where the performance of packet switching can be superior to that of circuit switching
* *Scenario 1*. Users share a 1 Mbps link, and each one alternates between two periods of activity and in activity, with the percent of active time is 10%
    * *Activity period*. Generate data at a constant rate of 100 kbps
    * *Inactivity period*. Generate no data
    * *Analysis*.
        * *Circuit switching case*. 100 kbps must be reserved for each user at all times, reducing the bandwidth for each user
        * *Packet switching case*. The probability that there are 11 or more simultaneously active user is very small
            * *Example*. If there are 35 users then the probability is approximately 0.0004
            * *Consequence*. Packet switching is more efficient in this case
* *Scenario 2*. There are 10 users, one of which suddenly generates one thousand 1000-bit packets, while other users remain quiescent and do not generate packets
    * *Circuit switching case*. Under TDM circuit switching, with 10 slots per frame, each of which contains 1000 bits

        $\to$ The active user can only use its one time slot per frame to transmit data, while the remaining 9 time slots idle
    * *Packet switching*. The active user can continuously send its packets at the full link rate of 1 Mbps
* *Consequence*. The trend has certainly been in the direction of packet switching

## A network of networks 
**Network of networks**. The access ISP can be any entity providing end systems access to the Internet

$\to$ The access ISPs themselves must be interconnected, i.e. network of networks
* *Aspects affecting network of networks structure*. Economics and national policy, rather than performance considerations
* *Understanding today's Internet network structure*. Incrementally build a series of network structures, with each new structure being a better approximation of the complex Internet we have today

    >**NOTE**. The objective of network of networks is to interconnect the ISPs so that all end systems can send packets to each other

**Network structures**.
* *Direct connection*. Naive approach, where access ISPs are directed connected to each other
    * *Drawback*. Too costly, i.e. each access ISP to have a separate communication link to each of the other access ISPs
* *Network structure 1*. Interconnect all of the access ISPs with a single global transit ISP
    * *Global transit ISP (imaginary)*. A network of routers and communication links which spans the globe and has at least one router near each of the access ISPs
        * *Drawback*. Very costly for the global ISP
    * *Improvement*. Charge each of the access ISPs for connectivity, with the pricing reflecting the amount of traffic an access ISP exchanges with the global ISP
        * *Customer*. Access ISPs
        * *Provider*. The global transit ISP
* *Network structure 2*. If some company builds and operates a global transit ISP which is profitable

    $\to$ It is natural for other companies to build their own global transit ISPs and compete with the original one
    * *Idea*. Consist of hundreds of thousands of access ISPs and multiple global transit ISPs, with the global transit ISPs interconnected

        $\to$ Access ISPs can choose among the competing global transit providers
* *Network structure 3*. Multi-tier hierarchical structure, which is still only a crude approximation of today's Internet
    * *Regional ISPs*. In practice, somne ISPs have large global coverage and do directly connect with many access ISPs

        $\to$ In any given region, there may be a regional ISP, to which the access ISPs in the region connect
        * *Larger regional ISPs*. In some regions, there may be a larger regional ISP, e.g. possibly spanning an entire country, to which the smaller region ISPs in the region connect

            $\to$ The larger regional ISP then connects to a tier-1 ISP
    * *Tier-1 ISPs*. Each region ISP connects to tier-1 ISPs, which are similar to our imaginary global transit ISP
        * *Range*. Present in every city in the world
    * *Competency between ISPs*. There are multiple competing regional ISPs in a region, as well as multiple tier-1 ISPs competing
* *Network structure 4*. To build a network that more closely resembles today's Internet, we must add points of presences (PoPs), multi-homing, peering, and Internet exchange points (IXPs) to network structure 3
    * *Points of prersence*. Simply a groupd of one or more routers, at the same location, in the provider's network, where customer ISPs can connect into the provider ISP
        * *Connection from customer network to provider's PoP procedure*. Lease a high-speed link from a third-party telecommunications provider 
            
            $\to$ This is to directly connect one of its routers to a router at the PoP
    * *Multi-home*. Any ISP, except for tier-1 ISPs, may choose to multi-home, i.e. connect to two or more provider ISPs
        * *Purpose*. Continue to send and receive packets into the Internet, even if one of its provider has a failure
    * *Peer*. Customer ISPs pay their provider ISPs to obtain global Internet interconnectivity

        $\to$ To reduce these costs, a pair of nearby ISPs at the same level of hierarchy can peer
        * *Peering*. Two ISPs at the same level of hierarchy directly connect their networks together

            $\to$ The traffic between them passes over the direct connection, rather than though upstream intermediaries
        
        >**NOTE**. Tier-1 ISPs also peer with one another, settlement-free, i.e. neither ISP pays the other
    * *Internet exchange point (IXP)*. A meeting point where multiple ISPs can peer together
        * *Typical form*. In a stand-alone building with its own switche
* *Network structure 5*. Describe the Internet of 2012, which builds on top of network structure 4 with content provider networks added

    * *Content provider network*. Google is one of the leading examples of a content provider network
    * *Bypassing the upper tiers of the Internet*. Google private network attempts to bypass the upper tiers of the Internet by peering with lower-tier ISPs via direct connection or IXPs
        * *Problem*. Many access ISPs can only be reached by transiting through tier-1 networks

            $\to$ Google network also connects to tier-1 ISPs
        * *Purpose*. 
            * Reduce the payments to upper-tier ISPs
            * Have greater control of how its services are ultimately delivered to end users
