# Networks under attack
**Network security**. 
* *Problem*. Behind the network, there is a dark side, where bad guys attempt to wreak havoc in our daily lives by damaging our Internet-connected computers, violating our privacy, and refereing inoperable the Internet services on which we depend
* *Network security*. 
    * About how the bad guys can attack computer networks, and  how we can defend networks against those attacks
    * About designing new architectures which are immune to attacks in the first place

## The bad guys can put malware into our host via the Internet
**Malware**. Malicious stuff from the Internet, which can enter and infect our devices
* *Functionality*. A malware can do all kinds of devious things, e.g. deleting files, install spyware, etc.
* *Botnet*. Our compromised host may also be enrolled in a network of thousands of similarity compromised devices, collectively known as a botnet

    $\to$ A botnet can be controlled by the bad guys to leverage for spam e-mail distribution or distributed denial-of-service attacks against targeted hosts

**Malware spreading**.
* *Self-replicating*. Much of the malware is self-replicating, i.e. once it infects one host, from that host it seeks entry into other hosts over the Internet

$\to$ Self-replicating malware can spread exponentially fast
* *Virus and worm*. Malware can spread in the form of a virus or a worm
    * *Viruses*. Malware which require some form of user interaction to infect the user's device
        * *Example*. An e-mail attachment containing malicious executable code
    * *Worms*. Malware which can enter a device without any explicit user interaction
        * *Example*. A vulnerable network application may allow an attacker to send malware

### The bad guys can attack servers and network infrastructure
**Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks**. A broad class of security area
* *Idea*. A DoS attack renders a network, host, or other piece of infrastructure unusable by legitimate users
* *Types of DoS attacks*.
    * *Vulnerability attack*. Involve sending a few well-crafted messages to a vulnerable application os OS running on a targeted host

        $\to$ If the right sequence of packets is sent to a vulnerable application or OS, the service can stop, or the host can crash
    * *Bandwidth flooding*. The attacker sends a deluge of packets to the targeted hosts

        $\to$ This makes the target's access link clogged, preventing legitimate packets from reaching the server
    * *Connection flooding*. The attacker establishes a large number of half-open or fully open TCP connections at the target host

        $\to$ The host can become so bogged down with these bogus connections that it stops accepting legitimate connections
