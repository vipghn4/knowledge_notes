# Voice-over-IP
**Internet telephony**. Real-time conversational voice over the Internet
* *Other name*. Voice-over-IP (VoIP)

## Limitations of the best-effort IP service
**Best effort service provided by IP**. 
* *Idea*. 
    * The service makes its best effort to move each datagram, from source to destination, as quickly as possible
    * The service makes no promises about getting the packet to the destination within some delay bound, or about a limit on the percentage of packets lost
* *Consequence*. The lack of guarantees poses significant challenges to the design of real-time conversational applications, which are acutely sensitive to packet delay, jitter, and loss

**Application techniques to enhence VoIP over a best-effort network**. Approaches do not require any change in the network core, or even in the transport at the end hosts
* *Scenario*.
    * The sender generates bytes at a rate of 8000 bytes per second
    * Every 20 msecs the sender gathers these bytes into a chunk, which, along with a special header, are encapsulated in a UDP segment, via a call to the socket interface

        $\to$ The number of bytes in a chunk is (20 msecs) - (8000 bytes/sec) = 160 bytes, and a UDP segment is sent every 20 msecs
* *Observations*.
    * *Ideal scenario*. If each packet makes it to the receiver with a constant end-to-end delay, then packets arrive at the receiver periodically every 20 msecs

        $\to$ The receiver can simply play back each chunk as soon as it arrives
    * *Real scenario*. Some packets can be lost, and most packets will not have the same end-to-end delay, even in a lightly congested Internet
        * *Consequence*. The receiver must take more care in determining
            * When to play back a chunk
            * What to do with a missing chunk

### Packet loss
**Packet loss and UDP segment transmission in VoIP application**.
1. The UDP segment is encapsulated in an IP datagram
2. As the datagram wanders through the network, it passes through router buffers, i.e. queues, while waiting for transmission on outbound links

    $\to$ It is possible that one or more of the buffers in the path from sender to receiver is full, leading to packet loss

**Packet loss and TCP/IP packet transmission in VoIP application**. Loss could be eliminated by sending packets over TCP, which provides for reliable data transfer, rather than over UDP
* *Problem*. 
    * Re-transmission mechanisms are often considered unacceptable for conversational real-time audio applications
        * *Explain*. They increase end-to-end delay
    * Due to TCP congestion control, packet loss may result in a reduction of the TCP sender's transmission rate, to a rate which is lower than the receiver's drain rate

        $\to$ This leads to buffer starvation, causing a severe impact on voice intelligibility at the receiver
* *Consequence*. Most existing VoIP applications run on UDP by default\

**Packet loss effects**. Losing packets is not necessarily as disastrous as one might think

$\to$ Indeed, packet loss rates between 1 and 20 percent can be tolerated, depending on how voice is encoded and transmitted, and how loss is concealed at the receiver
* *Forward error correction (FEC)*. Can help conceal packet loss
    * *Idea*. Redundant information is transmitted along with the original information

        $\to$ Some of the lost original data can be recovered from the redundant information

>**NOTE**. If one or more of the links between sender and receiver is severely congested, and packet loss exceeds 10 to 20 percent
>$\to$ There is really nothing that can be done to achieve acceptable audio quality

### End-to-end delay
**End-to-end delay**. The accumulation of transmission, processing, and queuing delays in routers; propagation delays in links, and end-system processing delays
* *Delay perceivation in VoIP*.
    * End-to-end delays smaller than 150 msecs are not perceived by a human listener
    * Delays between 150 and 400 msecs can be acceptable but are not ideal
    * Delays exceeding 400 msecs can seriously hinder the interactivity in voice conversations

**Solution**. The receiving side of a VoIP application will typically disregard any packets, which are delayed more than a certain threshold, e.g. more than 400 msecs

$\to$ Packets are delayed by more than the threshold are effectively lost

### Packet jitter
**Jitter**. A crucial component of end-to-end delay is the varying queuing delays, which a packet experiences in the network's routers
* *Explain*. Due to varying delays, the time from when a packet is generated at some source, until it is received at the receiver, can fluctuate from packet to packet

    $\to$ This is known as jitter
* *Effects of jitter*. If the receiver ignores the presence of jitter, and plays out chunks, as soon as they arrive, then the resulting audio quality can easily become unintelligible at the receiver
* *Solution*. Jitter can be removed using sequewnce numbers, timestamps, and a playout delay

## Removing jetter at the receiver for audio
**Removing jetter at the receiver for audio**. The receiver should attempt to provide playout of voice chunks in the presence of random network jitter

$\to$ This is typically done by combining the following two mechanisms
* *Prepending each chunk with a timestamp*. The sender stamps each chunk with the time, at which the chunk was generated
* *Delaying playout of chunks at the receiver*. The playout delay of the received audio chunks must be long enough, so that most of the packets are received before their scheduled playout times

    $\to$ This playout delay can either be fixed throughout the duration of the audio session, or vary adaptively during the audio session lifetime

### Fixed playout delay
**Idea**. The receiver attempts to play out each chunk exactly $q$ msecs after the chunk is generated

$\to$ If a chunk is timestampted at the sender at time $t$, the recevier plays out the chunk at time $t+q$, assuming the chunk has arrived by that time
* *Consequence*. Packets arriving after their scheduled playout times are discarded and considered lost

**Choice of $q$**. VoIP can support delays up to about 400 msecs, although a more satisfying conversational experience is achieved with smaller values of $q$

<div style="text-align:center">

    <figcaption>Packet loo for different fixed playout delays</figcaption>
</div>

* *$q$ much smaller than 400 msecs*. Many packets may miss their scheduled playback times, due to the network-induced packet jitter
* *Conclusion*.
    * If large variations in end-to-end delay are typical, it is preferable to use a large $q$
    * If delay is small, and variations in delays are small, it is preferable to use a small $q$, perhaps less than 150 msecs

### Adaptive playout delay
**Idea**. Ideally, we want the playout delay to be minimized subject to the constraint that the loss be below a few percent

$\to$ We can estimate the network delay and the variance of the network delay, and adjust the playout delay accordingly at the beginning of each talk spurt

**Algorithm**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $t_i$ is the timestamp of the $i$th packet, i.e. the time the packet was generated by the sender
    * $r_i$ is the time packet $i$ is received by receiver
    * $p_i$ is the time packet $i$ is played at receiver
    * $d_i$ is an estimate of the average network delay upon reception of the $i$th packet
* *End-to-end network delay of the $i$th packet*. $r_i - t_i$
    
    $\to$ Due to network jitter, the delay will vary from packet to packet
* *Average delay estimation*. $d_i = (1 - u) d_{i-1} + u(r_i - t_i)$ where $u$ is a fixed constant

    $\to$ $d_i$ is a smoothed average of the observed network delays, which places more weight on the recently observed network delays than on the observed network delays of the distant past
* *Average deviation of the delay from the estimated average delay*.

    $$v_i=(1-u)v_{i-1} + u |r_i - t_i - d_i|$$

* *Calculation of $d_i$ and $v_i$*. Computed for every packet received, although they are used only to determine the playout point for the first packet in any talk spurt
* *Estimated playout time*. Once having calculated $d_i$ and $v_i$, the receiver employs the following algorithm for the playout of packets
    * If packet $i$ is the first packet of a talk spurt, its playout time $p_i$ is computed as

        $$p_i=t_i + d_i + Kv_i$$

        where $K>0$ is a defined constant
        * *Explain*. The purpose of $Kv_i$ is to set the playout time far enough into the future
            
            $\to$ Hopefully only a small fraction of the arriving packets in the talk spurt will be lost due to late arrivals
    * The playout point for any subsequent packet in a talk spurt is computed as an offset from the point in time when the first packet in the talk spurt was played out
        * *Explain*. Consider the length of time 
            
            $$q_i=p_i-t_i=d_i+Kv_i$$
            
            from when the first packet in the talk spurt is generated, until it is played out

            $\to$ If packet $j$ also belongs to this talk spurt, its playout time is estimated as

            $$p_j=t_j+q_i$$
* *Usage*. The algorithm makes perfect sense assuming that the receiver can tell whether a packet is the first packet in the talk spurt

## Recovering from packet loss
**Loss recovery schemes**. Schemes attempting to preserve acceptable audio quality in case of packet loss
* *Packet loss*. A packet is lost either if it never arrives at the receiver, or if it arrives after its scheduled playout time. Our VoIP example will
* *Retransmission of lost packets*. May not be feasible in a real-time conversational application, e.g. VoIP
    * *Explain*. 
        * Retransmitting a packet missing its playout deadline serves no purpose
        * Retransmitting a packet overflowing a router queue cannot normally be accomplished quickly enough
    * *Consequence*. VoIP applications often use some type of loss anticipation scheme
* *Common loss anticipation schemes*. Forward error correction (FEC) and interleaving

### Forward error correction (FEC)
**Basic idea**. Add redundant information to the original packet stream
* *Explain*. For the cost of marginally increasing the transmission rate
    
    $\to$ The redundant information can be used to reconstruct approximations or exact versions of some of the lost packets
* *Approach 1*. Send a redundant encoded chunk after every $n$ chunks
    * *Redundant chunk creation*. Obtained by exclusive OR-ing the $n$ original chunks
    * *Packet loss recovery*.
        * If any one packet of the group of $n + 1$ packets is lost
            
            $\to$ The receiver can fully reconstruct the lost packet
        * If two or more packets in a group are lost
            
            $\to$ The receiver cannot reconstruct the lost packets
    * *Selection of $n$*. By keeping n + 1, the group size, small
        * *Pros*. A large fraction of the lost packets can be recovered when loss is not excessive
        * *Cons*.
            * The greater the relative increase of the transmission rate
                * *Explain*. The transmission rate increases by a factor of $1/n$
            * The playout delay is increased
                * *Explain*. The receiver must wait to receive the entire group of packets before starting playout
* *Approach 2*. Send a lower-resolution audio stream as the redundant information

    <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/iTnqzGx.png">
        <figcaption>Piggybacking lower-quality redundant information</figcaption>
    </div>

    * *Example*. The sender might create a nominal audio stream and a corresponding low-resolution, low-bit rate audio stream
        
        $\to$ The low-bit rate stream is referred to as the redundant stream
    * *Construction of the $n$-th packet*. 
        1. Take the $n$-th chunk from the nominal stream
        2. Append to the taken chunk the $(n – 1)$-st chunk from the redundant stream
    * *Lost packet reconstruction*. 
        * *Nonconsecutive packet loss*. Whenever there is nonconsecutive packet loss
            
            $\to$ The receiver can conceal the loss by playing the low-bit rate encoded chunk arriving with the subsequent packet
        * *Consecutive packet loss*. In order to cope with consecutive loss, we can use a simple variation
            * *Idea*. The sender can append the $(n – 1)$-st and $(n – 2)$-nd low-bit rate chunk, or append the $(n – 1)$-st and $(n – 3)$-rd low-bit rate chunk, etc. 
                * *Explain*. By appending more low-bit rate chunks to each nominal chunk
                    
                    $\to$ The audio quality at the receiver becomes acceptable for a wider variety of harsh best-effort environments
            * *Drawback*. The additional chunks increase the transmission bandwidth and the playout delay
    * *Quality loss*. Low-bit rate chunks give lower quality than the nominal chunks, yet no quality loss is introduced
        * *Explain*. A stream of mostly high-quality chunks, occasional low-quality chunks, and no missing chunks gives good overall audio quality
    * *Benefits*.
        * The receiver only has to receive two packets before playback
            
            $\to$ The increased playout delay is small
        * If the low-bit rate encoding is much less than the nominal encoding
            
            $\to$ The marginal increase in the transmission rate will be small

### Interleaving
**Interleaving**. Send interleaved audio

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/IltpaMz.png">
    <figcaption>Sending interleaved audio</figcaption>
</div>

* *Explain*. The sender resequences units of audio data before transmission so that

    $\to$ Originally adjacent units are separated by a certain distance in the transmitted stream
    * *Example*. If units are 5 msecs in length and chunks are 20 msecs, i.e. four units per chunk
        
        $\to$ The $n$-th chunk could contain units $n, n+4, n+8, n+12$
* *Effects*. Interleaving can mitigate the effect of packet losses
    * *Explain*. The loss of a single packet from an interleaved stream results in multiple small gaps in the reconstructed stream

        $\to$ This is opposed to the single large gap that would occur in a noninterleaved stream
* *Pros*.
    * Interleaving can significantly improve the perceived quality of an audio stream
    * Interleaving has low overhead
    * Interleaving does not increase the bandwidth requirements of a stream
* *Cons*. Interleaving increases latency
    
    $\to$ This limits its use for conversational applications, although it can perform well for streaming stored audio

### Error concealment
**Error concealment schemes**. Attempt to produce a replacement for a lost packet, which is similar to the original
* *Feasibility*. This is possible since audio signals, and in particular speech, exhibit large amounts of short-term self-similarity
    * *Consequence*.
        * These techniques work for relatively small loss rates, and small packets
        * When the loss length approaches the length of a phoneme
            
            $\to$ These techniques break down, since whole phonemes may be missed by the listener
* *Packet repetition*. The simplest form
    * *Idea*. Replace lost packets with copies of the packets arrived immediately before the loss
    * *Pros*. Low computational complexity and reasonably well performance
* *Interpolation*.
    * *Idea*. Use audio before and after the loss to interpolate a suitable packet to cover the loss
    * *Pros and cons*. Perform somewhat better than packet repetition but is significantly more computationally intensive

## Case study - VoIP with Skype
**Skype**. An immensely popular VoIP application with over 50 million accounts active on a daily basis
* *Provided services*.
    * Host-to-host VoIP service
    * Host-to-phone services
    * Phone-to-host services 
    * Multi-party host-to-host video conferencing services

**Voice and video communication**.
* *Voice and video codecs*. For both voice and video, the Skype clients have at their disposal many different codecs
    
    $\to$ The client is capable of encoding the media at a wide range of rates and qualities
* *Packet transmission protocol*. By default,
    * Audio and video packets are sent over UDP
    * Control packets are sent over TCP
    * Media packets are also sent over TCP when firewalls block UDP streams
* *Loss recovery*. Skype uses FEC for loss recovery for both voice and video streams sent over UDP
* *Adaptive quality control*. The Skype client also adapts the audio and video streams it sends to current network conditions

**P2P network**. Skype uses P2P techniques in a number of innovative ways
* *P2P in instant messaging*. Host-to-host Internet telephony is inherently P2P
    * *Explain*. At the heart of the application, pairs of users, i.e. peers, communicate with each other in real time
* *P2P for user location*.
    * *Peers organization*. Peers (hosts) in Skype are organized into a hierarchical overlay network, with each peer classified as a super peer or an ordinary peer
    * *Username-to-index mapping*. Skype maintains an index mapping Skype usernames to current IP addresses and
port numbers
        
        $\to$ This index is distributed over the super peers
    * *Index searching*. When Alice wants to call Bob
        
        $\to$ Alice Skype client searches the distributed index to determine Bob’s current IP address
* *P2P for NAT traversal*. P2P techniques are also used in Skype relays, which are useful for establishing calls between hosts in home networks
    * *NAT*. Many home network configurations provide access to the Internet through NATs
        
        $\to$ A NAT prevents a host from outside the home network from initiating a connection to a host within the home network
        * *Consequence*. If both Skype callers have NATs
            
            $\to$ Neither can accept a call initiated by the other, making a call seemingly impossible
    * *Solution*. 
        1. When Alice signs in, she is assigned to a non-NATed super peer and initiates a session to that super peer
            * *Explain*. Since Alice is initiating the session, her NAT permits this session
                
                $\to$ This session allows Alice and her super peer to exchange control messages
        2. The same happens for Bob when he signs in
        3. When Alice wants to call Bob, she informs her super peer, who in turn informs Bob’s super peer, who in turn informs Bob of Alice’s incoming call
        4. If Bob accepts the call, the two super peers select a third non-NATed super peer, i.e. the relay peer
            * *Relay peer*. Relay data between Alice and Bob
        5. Alice’s and Bob’s super peers then instruct Alice and Bob respectively to initiate a session with the relay
        6. Alice then sends voice packets to the relay over the Alice-to-relay connection, which was initiated by Alice
        7. The relay then forwards these packets over the relay-to-Bob connection, which was initiated by Bob
        8. Packets from Bob to Alice flow over these same two relay connections in reverse
    * *Consequence*. Bob and Alice have an end-to-end connection even though neither can accept a session originating from outside

**Multi-party audio conference calls**. 
* *Problem*. With $N > 2$ participants, if each user were to send a copy of its audio stream to each of the $N - 1$ other users

    $\to$ $N(N - 1)$ audio streams would need to be sent into the network to support the audio conference
* *Bandwidth usgage reduction*. Use a clever distribution technique
    * *Idea*. 
        1. Each user sends its audio stream to the conference initiator
        2. The conference initiator combines the audio streams into one stream
            * *Stream combination*. Basically by adding all the audio signals together
        3. The conference initiator sends a copy of each combined stream to each of the other $N - 1$ participants
            
            $\to$ The number of streams is reduced to $2(N - 1)$

**Video conference**.
* *Two-person video conversations*. Skype routes the call peer-to-peer
* *Video conference call with $N > 2$ participants*. Due to the nature of the video medium
    
    $\to$ Skype does not combine the call into one stream at one location and then redistribute the stream to all the participants
    * *Idea*. 
        1. Each participant's video stream is routed to a server cluster
        2. The server cluster relays to each participant the $N - 1$ streams of the other participants
    * *Why not direct communication*. Why each participant sends a copy to a server rather than directly sending a copy of its video stream to each of the other $N - 1$ participants
        * *Motivation for the question*. For both approaches, $N(N - 1)$ video streams are being collectively received by the $N$ participants in the conference
        * *Answer*. Because upstream link bandwidths are significantly lower than downstream link bandwidths in most access links
            
            $\to$ The upstream links may not be able to support the $N - 1$ streams with the P2P approach
