# Voice-over-IP
**Internet telephony**. Real-time conversational voice over the Internet
* *Other name*. Voice-over-IP (VoIP)

## Limitations of the best-effort IP service
**Best effort service provided by IP**. 
* *Idea*. 
    * The service makes its best effort to move each datagram, from source to destination, as quickly as possible
    * The service makes no promises about getting the packet to the destination within some delay bound, or about a limit on the percentage of packets lost
* *Consequence*. The lack of guarantees poses significant challenges to the design of real-time conversational applications, which are acutely sensitive to packet delay, jitter, and loss

**Application techniques to enhence VoIP over a best-effort network**. Approaches do not require any change in the network core, or even in the transport at the end hosts
* *Scenario*.
    * The sender generates bytes at a rate of 8000 bytes per second
    * Every 20 msecs the sender gathers these bytes into a chunk, which, along with a special header, are encapsulated in a UDP segment, via a call to the socket interface

        $\to$ The number of bytes in a chunk is (20 msecs) - (8000 bytes/sec) = 160 bytes, and a UDP segment is sent every 20 msecs
* *Observations*.
    * *Ideal scenario*. If each packet makes it to the receiver with a constant end-to-end delay, then packets arrive at the receiver periodically every 20 msecs

        $\to$ The receiver can simply play back each chunk as soon as it arrives
    * *Real scenario*. Some packets can be lost, and most packets will not have the same end-to-end delay, even in a lightly congested Internet
        * *Consequence*. The receiver must take more care in determining
            * When to play back a chunk
            * What to do with a missing chunk

### Packet loss
**Packet loss and UDP segment transmission in VoIP application**.
1. The UDP segment is encapsulated in an IP datagram
2. As the datagram wanders through the network, it passes through router buffers, i.e. queues, while waiting for transmission on outbound links

    $\to$ It is possible that one or more of the buffers in the path from sender to receiver is full, leading to packet loss

**Packet loss and TCP/IP packet transmission in VoIP application**. Loss could be eliminated by sending packets over TCP, which provides for reliable data transfer, rather than over UDP
* *Problem*. 
    * Re-transmission mechanisms are often considered unacceptable for conversational real-time audio applications
        * *Explain*. They increase end-to-end delay
    * Due to TCP congestion control, packet loss may result in a reduction of the TCP sender's transmission rate, to a rate which is lower than the receiver's drain rate

        $\to$ This leads to buffer starvation, causing a severe impact on voice intelligibility at the receiver
* *Consequence*. Most existing VoIP applications run on UDP by default\

**Packet loss effects**. Losing packets is not necessarily as disastrous as one might think

$\to$ Indeed, packet loss rates between 1 and 20 percent can be tolerated, depending on how voice is encoded and transmitted, and how loss is concealed at the receiver
* *Forward error correction (FEC)*. Can help conceal packet loss
    * *Idea*. Redundant information is transmitted along with the original information

        $\to$ Some of the lost original data can be recovered from the redundant information

>**NOTE**. If one or more of the links between sender and receiver is severely congested, and packet loss exceeds 10 to 20 percent
>$\to$ There is really nothing that can be done to achieve acceptable audio quality

### End-to-end delay
**End-to-end delay**. The accumulation of transmission, processing, and queuing delays in routers; propagation delays in links, and end-system processing delays
* *Delay perceivation in VoIP*.
    * End-to-end delays smaller than 150 msecs are not perceived by a human listener
    * Delays between 150 and 400 msecs can be acceptable but are not ideal
    * Delays exceeding 400 msecs can seriously hinder the interactivity in voice conversations

**Solution**. The receiving side of a VoIP application will typically disregard any packets, which are delayed more than a certain threshold, e.g. more than 400 msecs

$\to$ Packets are delayed by more than the threshold are effectively lost

### Packet jitter
**Jitter**. A crucial component of end-to-end delay is the varying queuing delays, which a packet experiences in the network's routers
* *Explain*. Due to varying delays, the time from when a packet is generated at some source, until it is received at the receiver, can fluctuate from packet to packet

    $\to$ This is known as jitter
* *Effects of jitter*. If the receiver ignores the presence of jitter, and plays out chunks, as soon as they arrive, then the resulting audio quality can easily become unintelligible at the receiver
* *Solution*. Jitter can be removed using sequewnce numbers, timestamps, and a playout delay

## Removing jetter at the receiver for audio
**Removing jetter at the receiver for audio**. The receiver should attempt to provide playout of voice chunks in the presence of random network jitter

$\to$ This is typically done by combining the following two mechanisms
* *Prepending each chunk with a timestamp*. The sender stamps each chunk with the time, at which the chunk was generated
* *Delaying playout of chunks at the receiver*. The playout delay of the received audio chunks must be long enough, so that most of the packets are received before their scheduled playout times

    $\to$ This playout delay can either be fixed throughout the duration of the audio session, or vary adaptively during the audio session lifetime

### Fixed playout delay
**Idea**. The receiver attempts to play out each chunk exactly $q$ msecs after the chunk is generated

$\to$ If a chunk is timestampted at the sender at time $t$, the recevier plays out the chunk at time $t+q$, assuming the chunk has arrived by that time
* *Consequence*. Packets arriving after their scheduled playout times are discarded and considered lost

**Choice of $q$**. VoIP can support delays up to about 400 msecs, although a more satisfying conversational experience is achieved with smaller values of $q$

</div>

* *$q$ much smaller than 400 msecs*. Many packets may miss their scheduled playback times, due to the network-induced packet jitter
* *Conclusion*.
    * If large variations in end-to-end delay are typical, it is preferable to use a large $q$
    * If delay is small, and variations in delays are small, it is preferable to use a small $q$, perhaps less than 150 msecs

### Adaptive playout delay
**Idea**. Ideally, we want the playout delay to be minimized subject to the constraint that the loss be below a few percent

$\to$ We can estimate the network delay and the variance of the network delay, and adjust the playout delay accordingly at the beginning of each talk spurt

**Algorithm**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $t_i$ is the timestamp of the $i$th packet, i.e. the time the packet was generated by the sender
    * $r_i$ is the time packet $i$ is received by receiver
    * $p_i$ is the time packet $i$ is played at receiver
    * $d_i$ is an estimate of the average network delay upon reception of the $i$th packet
* *End-to-end network delay of the $i$th packet*. $r_i - t_i$
    
    $\to$ Due to network jitter, the delay will vary from packet to packet
* *Average delay estimation*. $d_i = (1 - u) d_{i-1} + u(r_i - t_i)$ where $u$ is a fixed constant

    $\to$ $d_i$ is a smoothed average of the observed network delays, which places more weight on the recently observed network delays than on the observed network delays of the distant past
