# Connectionless transport - UDP
**Motivation**. Suppose we are interested in designing a no-frills, bare-bones transport protocol
* *Vacuous transport protocol*. 
    * *Sending side*. Take messages from application process and pass them directly to the network layer
    * *Receiving side*. Take messages arriving from the network layer and pass them directly to the application process
* *Problem*. We have to do a little, more than nothing, e.g. the transport layer has to provide a multiplexing/demultiplexing service to pass data between the network layer and the correct application-level process

**UDP**. Do as little as a transport protocol can do, i.e. multiplexing/demultiplexing and some light error checking

$\to$ Applications built upon UDP are almost directly talking with IP
* *Data flow*.
    1. UDP takes messages from the application process
    2. UDP attaches source and destination port number fields for the multiplexing/demultiplexing service, and two other small fields
    3. UDP passes the resulting segment to the network layer
    4. The network layer encapsulates the transport-layer segment into an IP datagram
    5. The network layer makes a best-effort attempt to deliver the segment to the receiving host
    6. If the segment arrives at the receiving host, UDP uses the destination port number to deliver the segment's data to the correct application process
* *Connectionless communication*. UDP does not use handhshaking between sending and receiving transport-layer entities before sending a segment
* *Example usage*. DNS, i.e. since 
    * UDP is fast and low overhead
    * DNS requests are generally very small and fit well within UDP segments
    * UDP is not reliable, but reliability can be added on application layer, i.e. by timeout and resending requests
* *Reference documentation*. RFC 768

**Applications using UDP**. Many applications are better suited for UDP due to the following reasons

* *Finer application-level control over what data is sent and when*. Under UDP, as soon as an application process passes data to UDP

    $\to$ UDP will package the data inside a UDP segment and immediately pass the segment to the network layer
    * *TCP drawbacks*. 
        * *Congestion control*. When one or more links between the source and destination hosts become excessively congested
            
            $\to$ TCP has a congestion-control mechanism which throttles the transport-layer TCP sender
        * *Reliability communication*. TCP also resends a segment until the receipt of the segment has been acknowledged by the destination, regardless of how long reliable delivery takes

            $\to$ This is not good for real-time applications, which often require a minimum sending rate and can tolerate some data loss
* *No connection establishment*. UDP just blasts away without any formal preliminaries, rather than TCP, i.e. use a three-way handshake before starting to transfer data

    $\to$ UDP does not introduce any delay to establish a connection
    
    >**NOTE**. This is probably the principal reason why DNS runs over UDP rather than TCP
    >* *Explain*. DNS would be much slower if it ran over TCP

* *No connection state*. 
    * *Connection state in TCP*. TCP maintains connection state in the end system
        * *Connection state*. Include receive and send buffers, congestion-control parameters, and sequence and acknowledgement number parameters
        * *Usage*. Required to implement TCP's reliable data transfer service and provide congestion control
    * *Connection state in UDP*. UDP does not maintain connection state and does not track any of the parameters

        $\to$ A server devoted to a particular application can typically support many active clients when the application runs over UDP rather than TCP
* *Small packet header overhead*. A TCP segment has 20 bytes of header overhead in every segment, whereas UDP has only 8 bytes of overhead

**Example usage of UDP**.
* RIP routing table, with reliable data transfer is implemented in application layer
* Network management applications, which must often run when the network is in a stressed state
* Multimedia applications, e.g. streaming of audio and video
    * *Arguments around UDP for multimedia*. UDP has no congestion control to prevent the network from entering a congested state

**Reliable data transfer with UDP**. Reliability can be done by building it into the application itself
* *Pros*. Allow the application to communicate reliably without being subjected to the transmission-rate constraints imposed by TCP's congestion-control mechanism
* *Cons*. The application developer may be busy debugging for a long time

## UDP segment structure
**UDP segment structure**.

* *Data field*. Contain either a query message or a response message

    $\to$ This is occupied by the application data
    * *Example*. For streaming audio application, audio samples fill the data field
* *Header fields*. Consist of four fields, each of two bytes
    * *Port numbers*. Contain source and destination port numbers
    * *Length field*. Specify the number of bytes in the UDP segment, i.e. header plus data
        
        $\to$ This is required since the size of the data field may differ across UDP segments
    * *Checksum*. Used by the receiving host to check whether errors have been introduced into the segment
        * *Idea*. Calculated over a few of the fields in the IP header, in addition to the UDP segment

**Reference documentation**. RFC 768

## UDP checksum
**UDP checksum**. Used to determine whether bits within the UDP segment have been altered as it moved from source to destination
* *Calculation at sending side*. Perform the 1s complement of the sum of all the 16-bit words in the segment, with any overflow encountered during the sum being wrapped around, i.e. clipped

    $\to$ The result is then put in the checksum field of the UDP segment
* *Verification at receiving side*. All 16-bit words are added, including the checksum

    $\to$ If no errors are introduced into the packet, then the sum at the receiver will be all ones, i.e. `1111...1111`, otherwise there would be some zero bit

**Why UDP provides a checksum while many link-layer protocols provide error checking**. Neither link-by-link reliability nor in-memory error deteciton is guaranteed, thus UDP must provide error detection at the transport layer, i.e.
* There is no guarantee that all the links between source and destination provide error checking
* Even if segments are correctly transferred across a link, it is possible that bit errors could be introduced when a segment is stored in a router's memory

**End-end basis**. UDP must provide error detection at the transport layer, on an end-end basis, if the end-end data transfer service is to provide error detection
* *End-end principle*. The end-end basis above is an example of end-end principle in system design, which is about the placement of functions in distributed computer systems
    * *Motivation*. 
        * *Historical context*. From the early days of the Internet, there are several questions
            * What should the network implement to support an application
            * How does this support impact other applications
            * What services should the application provide
        * *Role*. E2E is widely considered to be the foundation of how the Internet is designed
        * *Observations*. 
            * For communicating two processes upon some means, the reliability obtained from that means cannot be expected to perfectly aligned with the reliability requirements of the processes
            * Meeting or exceeding very high-reliability requirements of communicating processes is more costly than obtaining the requirement by positive end-to-end acknowledgements and retransmisisons
            * It is far easier to obtain reliability by mechanisms in the end hosts of a network, rather than in intermediary nodes
    * *Principle*. Network features should be implemented as close to the end points of the network, i.e. the applications, as possible
        * Implement functionality as high up in the stack as possible, otherwise we may affect other applications which do not require functionality
            * *Example*.
                * Do not implement encryption in the kernel, do it at application level
                * Since no reliability or drdering in network, do it in transport layer
        * Implement functionality lower down if necessary for performance
    * *Consequences*. Since certain functionality, e.g. error detection, must be implemented on an end-end basis

        $\to$ Functions placed at the lower levels may be redundant or of little value when compared to the cost of providing them at the higher level
