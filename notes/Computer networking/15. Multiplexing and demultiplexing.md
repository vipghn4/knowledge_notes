# Multiplexing and demultiplexing
**Transport layer in destination host**. The transport layer receives segments from the network layer just below

$\to$ The transport layer has the responsibility of delivering the data in these segments to the appropriate application process running in the host
* *Sockets*. A process can have one or more sockets, i.e. doors through which data passes from the network to the process and vice versa

    $\to$ The transport layer in the receiving host delivers data directly to an intermediary socket
    * *Socket identifier*. Since there can be more than one socket in the receiving host at a time

        $\to$ Each socket must have a unique identifier
* *Directing incoming transport-layer segment to the appropriate socket*. Each transport-layer segment has a set of fields in the segment for this purpose
    
    $\to$ At the receiving end, the transport layer examines these fields to identify the receiving socket, then directs the segment to that socket

    * *Demultiplexing*. The job of delivering the data in a transport-layer segment to the correct socket
    * *Multiplexing*. The job of 
        * Gathering data chunks at the source host from different sockets 
        * Encapsulating each chunk with header information to create segments
        * Passing the segments to the network layer
* *Generalization*. Demultiplexing and multiplexing are concerns whenever a single protocol at one layer is used by multiple protocols at the next higher layer

**Transport-layer segment structure**.

    <figcaption>Source and destination port-number fields in a transport-layer segment</figcaption>
</div>

* *Source and destination port-number fields*. Used for multiplexing and demultiplexing
    * *Port structure*. Each port number is a 16-bit number, from 0 to 65535
    * *Well-known port numbers*. Port numbers reserved for use by well-known application protocols, e.g. HTTP, FTP, etc.
        * *Range*. 0 to 1023, i.e. first 10 bits
        * *Reference documentation*. RFC 1700

    >**NOTE**. When developing an application, we must assign it a port number

* *Other header fields*. Differ from TCP and UDP

**Demultiplexing idea**. 
1. When a segment arrives at the host, the transport layer examines the destination port number in the segment
2. The transport layer then directs the segment to the corresponding socket
3. The segment's data then passes through the socket into the attached process

## Connectionless multiplexing and demultiplexing
**Socket initiation and port assignment**.
* *Automatic port assignment*. `clientSocket = socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)`
    * *Idea*. The transport layer automatically assigns a port number to the socket
    * *Port number to assign*. A port in range 1024 to 65535, which is currently not being used by any other UDP port in the host
    * *Usage*. Typically used by the client side of the application
* *Manual port assignment*. `clientSocket.bind("", 19157)`
    * *Idea*. After creating the socket, we can associate a specific port number, e.g. 19157, to the UDP socket via `bind()` method

    >**NOTE**. If the application developer writing the code were implementing the server side of a well-known protocol
    >$\to$ The developer would have to assign the corresponding well-known port number

    * *Usage*. Typically used by the server side of the application

**Multiplexing and demultiplexing**. 
* *Scenario*. A process in host A, with UDP port 19157, wants to send a chunk of application data to a process with UDP port 46428 in host B
* *Transport layer data transmission*. 
    1. The transport layer in host A creates a transport-layer segment including 
        * The application data
        * The source port number and destination port number
        * Two other values, which will be discussed later
    2. The transport layer then passes the resulting segment to the network layer
    3. The network layer encapsulates the segment in an IP datagram and makes a best-effort attempt to deliver the segment to the receiving host
    4. If the segment arrives at the receiving host B, the transport layer at the receiving host examines the destination port number in the segment
    5. The transport layer then delivers the segment to its socket identified by port number 46428
* *Identification of UDP socket*. A UDP socket is fully identified by a two-tuple, i.e. a destination IP address and a dearets will be directed to the same destination process, via the same destination socket

**Purposes of source port number attached in data segments**. Consider the senario above
* *A-to-B data segments*. In these segments, the source port number serves as part of a "return address"
    * *Explain*. When B wants to send a segment back to A, the destination port in the B-to-A segment will be the source port value of the A-to-B segment

## Connection-oriented multiplexing and demultiplexing
**TCP socket identification**. A TCP socket is identified by a four-tuple, i.e. source IP address, source port number, destination IP address, and destination port number

$\to$ When a TCP segment arrives from the network to a host, the host uses all four values to direct, i.e. demultiplex, the segment to the appropriate socket
* *Consequence*. Two arriving TCP segments with different source IP addresses or source port numbers will be directed to two different sockets

**TCP client-server example**.
* *Connection-establishment request*. Nothing more than a TCP segment with destination port number `{port_number}` and a special connection-establishment bit set in the TCP header

    >**NOTE**. This segment also includes the source port number chosen by the client

    * *Example code*.

        ```python
        clientSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
        clientSocket.connect((serverName,12000)) # destination port number to establish TCP connection
        ```

* *Server side processing*. 
    1. When the host OS of the computer running the server process receives the incoming connection-request segment with destination port 12000

        $\to$ It locates, i.e. identifies, the server process waiting to accept a connection on port number 12000
    2. The server process then creates a new socket, i.e. `connectionSocket, addr = serverSocket.accept()`
    3. The transport layer at the server notes the four values identifying the newly created connection

        $\to$ All subsequently arriving segments whose four values match the noted four values will be demultiplexed to the newly created socket
    4. The TCP connection is now in place, and the client and server can now send data to each other

**Multiple TCP connections on a server**. The server host may suport many simultaneous TCP connection sockets, each of which is attached to a process, and is identified by its own four-tuple

$\to$ When a TCP segment arrives at the host, the four fields are used to direct, i.e. demultiplex, the segment to the appropriate socket

## Web servers and TCP
**Process-socket correspondence**. In high-performing Web servers, there is often one process creating a new thread with a new connection socket for each new client connection

$\to$ For such a server, at any given time, there may be many connection sockets, with different IDs, attached to the same process

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Port scanning**. 
* *Welcome socket in TCP server*. A server process waits patiently on an open port for contact by a remote client

    $\to$ If we determine that a port is open on a host, we may be able to map that port to a specific application running on the host
* *Usage for system administration*. System administrators are often interested in knowing which network applicaitons are running on the hosts in their networks
* *Flaws*. Attackers, in order to "case the joint", also want to know which ports are open on target hosts

    $\to$ If a host is found to be running an application with a known security flaw, then that host is ripe for attack
* *Determining which applications are listening on which ports*. Relatively easy task
    * *Port scanners*. Public domain programs whose task is to determine which applications are listening on which ports
    * *Idea*. 
        * *For TCP*. Sequentially scan ports, looking for ports which are accepting TCP connections
        * *For UDP*. Sequentially scan ports, looking for ports which respond to transmitted UDP segments
