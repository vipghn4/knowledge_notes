# Virtual circuit and datagram networks
**Connection and connectionless network-layer services**. Network layer, just as transport layer, can provide connection and connectionless services between two hosts
* *Similarity to transport-layer connection and connectionless services*. 
    * A network-layer connection service begins with handshaking between the source and the destination hosts
    * A network-layer connectionless service does not have any handshaking between the source and the destination hosts
* *Difference from transport-layer connection and connectionless services*.
    * *Sources and destinations*.
        * *Network-layer services*. Host-to-host services
        * *Transport-layer services*. Process-to-process services
    * *Mutual exclusive of connection and connectionless services*. In all major computer network architectures to date, the network layer provides either host-to-host connection or connectionless services, but not both
        * *Virtual-circuit (VC) networks*. Computer networks providing only a connection service
        * *Datagram networks*. Computer networks providing only a connectionless service
    * *Implementation of connection-oriented services*.
        * *Transport-layer connection-oriented services*. Implemented at the edge of the network, in the end systems
        * *Network-layer connection services*. Implemented in the routers in the network core, as well as in the end systems

>**NOTE**. The Internet is a datagram network

## Virtual-circuit networks
**Virtual curcuit**. A means of transporting data over a packet-switched network, in such a way that it appears as if there is a dedicated physical link between the source and destination end systems of the data
* *Meaning of "virtual circuit"*. Synonymous with "virtual connection"

**VC structure**. A VC consists of
* A path, i.e. a series of links and routers, between the source and destination hosts
* VC numbers, i.e. one number for each link along the path
* Entries in the forwarding table in each router along the path

**Link forwarding**. Since a virtual circuit may have a different VC number on each link

$\to$ Each intervening router must replace the VC number of each traversing packet with a new VC number, i.e. forwarding
* *Forwarding table*. The new VC number is obtained from the forwarding table
    * *Forwarding table structure*. Each row represents a VC number mapping and has the format `[incoming_interface, incoming_VC_num, outgoing_interface, outgoing_VC_num]`
        * *`incoming_interface` and `outgoing_interface`*. Network interfaces for input and output of routers
        * *`incoming_VC_num` and `outgoing_VC_num`*. VC numbers assigned to each network interface
    * *Forwarding table update*. 
        * Whenever a new VC is established across a router, an entry is added to the forwarding table
        * Whenever a VC terminates, the appropriate entries in each table along its path are removed
* *Idea*. Each router's forwarding table includes VC number translation, mapping the incoming VC numbers to outgoing VC numbers
* *Example on VC numbers*. Consider the figure above, where the numbers next to the links of R1 are the link interface numbers

    </div>
 
    * The path A-R1-R2-B are chosen
    * VC numbers 12, 22, and 32 are assigned to the three links along the path

**Problems of keeping the same VC number on each of the links along a packet's route**.
* *Problem 1*. Replacing the VC number from link to link reduces the length of the VC field in the packet header
    * *Explain*. 
* *Problem 2*. VC setup is considerably simplified by permitting a different VC number at each link along the path of the VC
    * *Explain*. 
        * With multiple VC numbers, each link in the path can choose a VC number independently of the VC numbers chosen at other links along the path
        * If a common VC number were required for all links along the path

            $\to$ The routers would have to exchange and process a substantial number of messages to agree on a common VC number

**Connection state information**. In a VC network, the network's routers must maintain connection state information for the ongoing connections
* *Maintaining VC translation information*.
    * Each time a new connection is established across a router, a new connection entry must be added to the router's forwarding table
    * Each time a connection is released, an entry must be removed from the table
* *Maintaining network interface assignment information*. Even if there is no VC-number translation

    $\to$ It is still necessary to maintain connection state information associating VC numbers with output interface numbers

**Phases in a VC**.

    <figcaption>VC setup</figcaption>
</div>

* *VC setup*.
    1. The sending transport layer contacts the network layer, specifies the receiver's address, and waits for the network to set up the VC
    2. The network layer determines the path between the sender and receiver, i.e the series of links and routers, through which all packets of the VC will travel
    3. The network layer determines the VC number for each link along the path
    4. The network layer adds an entry in the forwarding table in each router along the path
    5. (Optional) The network layer reserve resources, e.g. bandwidth, along the path of the VC
* *Data transfer*. Once the VC has been established, packets can begin to flow along the VC
* *VC teardown*. Initiated when the sender, or receiver, informs the network layer of its desire to terminate the VC
    1. The network layer then typically inform the end system on the other side of the network of the call termination
    2. The network layer updates the forwarding tables in each of the packet routers on the path to indicate that the VC no longer exists

**Differences in connection setup in transport layer and network layer**.
* *Transport layer*. Involve only the two end systems

    $\to$ The routers within the newtork are completely oblivious to this
* *VC network layer*. Routers along the path between the two end systems are involved in VC setup, and each router is fully aware of all the VCs passing through it

**Signaling messages**. 
* Messages that the end systems send into the network to initiate or terminate a VC, and
* Messages passed between the routers to set up the VC, i.e. to modify connection state in router tables

**Signaling protocols**. The protocols used to exchange signaling messages

## Datagram networks
**Datagram network**. Each time an end system wants to send a packet, it stamps the packet with the address of the destination end system then pops the packet into the network

$\to$ There is no VC setup and routers do not maintain any VC state information

    <figcaption>Datagram network</figcaption>
</div>

* *Packet trajectory*. As a packet is transmitted from source to destination, it passes thorugh a series of routers

    $\to$ Each of the routers uses the packet's destination address to forward the packet
* *Forwarding table*. Each router has a forwarding table mapping destination addresses to link interfaces, i.e.
    1. When a packet arrives at the router, the router uses the packet's destination address to look up the appropriate output link interface in the forwarding table
    2. The router then intentionally forwards the packet to that output link interface

**Prefix matching forwarding table lookup**. The router matches a prefix of the packet's destination address with the entries in the table

$\to$ If there is a match, the router forwards the packet to a link associated with the match
* *Longest prefix matching rule*. When there are multiple matches, the router uses the longest prefix matching rule

    $\to$ The router forwards the packet to the link interface associated with the longest prefix match

**Changing rate of forwarding state**. Relatively slow
* *Explain*. In a datagram network, the forwarding tables are modified by the routing algorithms, which typically update a forwarding table every one-to-five minutes or so

    $\to$ In a VC network, however, a forwarding table in a router is modified whenever a new connection is set up, or torn down, through the router

## Origins of VC and datagram networks
**Origins of VC networks**. The notion of VC as a general organizing principle has its roots in the telephony world, which uses real circuits
* *Complexity*. With call setup and per-call state being maintained at the routers within the network

    $\to$ A VC network is arguably more complex than a datagram network
* *Why telephony industry uses VC*. Since they were connecting dumb end-system devices, e.g. a rotary phone with no buttons

**Origins of datagram networks**. The Internet, as a datagram network, grew out of the need to connect computers together
* *Complexity*. Given more sophisticated end-system devices, the Internet architects choose to make the network-layer service model as simple as possible
    * *Explain*. Additional functionality can be implemented at a higher layer, in the end systems

        $\to$This inverts the model of the telephone network
* *Consequence*.
    * Since the resulting Internet network-layer service model makes minimal service guarantees

        $\to$ It imposes minimal requirements on the network layer
        * *Consequence*. It is easier to interconnect networks using very different link-layer technologies with very different transmission rates and loss characteristics
    * Applications, e.g. e-mail, Web, etc., are implemented in hosts, i.e. servers, at the network edge
        * *Consequence*. Due to the ability to add a new service simply by attaching a host to the network and defining a new application-layer protocol 
            
            $\to$ New Internet applications are allowed to be deployed in remarkably short period of time

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Link (or edge) of a network (or graph)**. One of the connections between the nodes, or vertices, of the network

**VC numbers assignment**.
* *Values of VC numbers*.
    * *Control packet*. 0 is reserved for control packets
    * *Non-overlapping ranges of VC numbers*.
        * Range for permanent VCs
        * Range for incoming connections
        * Range for outgoing connections
* *VC numbers in two ends of a link*. The two ends of a link can use a different VC number

    >**NOTE**. We only care about forwarding the packet to the right outgoing link, thus agreement upon VC number between two ends of a link is not requried
