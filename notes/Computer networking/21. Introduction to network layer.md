# Introduction
**Simple example of network layer**. Consider a simple network with two hosts H1 and H2, and several routers on the path between them

* *Data transmission from H1 to H2*. 
    1. The network layer in H1 takes segments from the transport layer in H1, encapsulates each segment into a datagram, i.e. a network-layer packet

        $\to$ The datagram is sent to its nearby router R1
    2. At the receiving host H2, the network layer receives the datagrams from its nearby router R2, extracts the transport-layer segments

        $\to$ The segments are delivered up to the transport layer at H2
* *Primary role of the routers*. Forward datagrams from input links to output links
    * *Truncated protocol stack*. Routers have no upper layers above the network layer
        * *Explain*. Except for control purposes, routers do not run application- and transport-layer protocols

## Forwarding and routing
**Important network-layer functions**. The role of the network layer is to move packets from a sending host to a receiving host, thus it has two important functions
* *Forwarding*. When a packet arrives at a router's input link

    $\to$ The router must move the packet to the appropriate output link
* *Routing*. The network layer must determine the route or path taken by packets as they flow from a sender to a receiver
    * *Routing algorithms*. Algorithms calculating the paths
* *Differences between forwarding and routing*.
    * *Forwarding*. Refer to the router-local action of transferring a packet from an input link interface to the appropriate output link interface
    * *Routing*. Refer to the network-wide process determining the end-to-end paths, which packets take from source to destination

**Forwarding table**. Every router has a forwarding table

<div style="text-align:center">

    <figcaption>Routing algorithms determine values in forwarding tables</figcaption>
</div>

* *Packet forwarding idea*. A router forwards a packet by 
    1. Examine the value of a field in the arriving packet's header
    2. Use this header to index into the router's forwarding table
* *Value stored in the forwarding table entry for the header*. Indicate the router's outgoing link interface, to which the packet is to be forwarded
* *Header field used for forwarding purpose*. Depending on the network-layer protocol, the header value could be
    * The destination address of the packet, or
    * An indication of the connection, to which the packet belongs

**Forwarding table configuration**. This is a crucial issue exposing the important interplay between routing and forwarding
* *Routing algorithm*. Determine teh values inserted into the router's forwarding tables
    * *Centralized routing algorithm*. The algorithm is executed on a central site and download routing information to each of the routers
    * *Decentralized routing algorithm*. A piece of the distributed routing algorithm running in each router
* *Routing protocol messages*. In either cases of routing algorithms, a router receives routing protocol messages, which are used to configure its forwarding table
* *Manual forwarding table configuration*. Forwarding tables can be configured directly by human network operators physically present at the routers
    * *Drawbacks*. More error-prone and much slower to respond to changes in the network topology than a routing protocol

**Other terminologies**.
* *Packet switch*. A general packet-switching device which transfers a packet from input link interface to output link interface, according to the value in a header field of the packet
    * *Link-layer switches*. A type of packet switches, which base their forwarding decision on values in the fields of the link-layer frame

        $\to$ Switches are thus referred to as link-layer devices
    * *Routers*. Other types of packet switches, which base their forwarding decision on the value in the network layer field

        $\to$ Routers are network-layer devices

### Connection setup
**Connection setup**. Another important function of network layer
* *Explain*. Some network-layer architectures, e.g. ATM, frame relay, MPLS, etc., require the routers along the chosen path from source to destination to handshake with each other
    
    $\to$ This is to set up state before network-layer data packets within a given source-to-destination connection can begin the flow

## Network service models
**Network service models**. Define the characteristics of end-to-end transport of packets between sending and receiving end systems
* *Services provided by the network layer when the transport layer passes a packet to the network layer*.
    * *Guaranteed delivery*. This service guarantees that the packet will eventually arrive at its destination
    * *Guaranteed delivery with bounded delay*. This service guarantees delivery of the packet within a specified host-to-host delay bound
* *Services provided to flow of packets between a given source and destination*.
    * *In-order packet delivery*. Guarantee that packets arrive at the destination in the order they were sent
    * *Guaranteed minimal bandwidth*. Emulate the behavior of a transmission link of a specified bit rate between sending and receiving hosts
        * *Explain*. As long as the sending host transmits bits at a rate below the specified bit rate

            $\to$ No packet is lost and each packet arrives within a prespecified host-to-host delay
    * *Guaranteed maximum jitter*. Guarantee that the amount of time between the transmission of two successive packets at the sender is equal to the amount of time between their receipt at the destination
        * *"Jitter" meaning*. Slight irregular movement, variation, or unsteadiness
    * *Security services*. 
        * *Idea*. Using a secret session key known only by a source and destination host
            * The network layer in the source host can encrypt the payloads of all datagrams being sent to the destination host
            * The network layer in the destination host can decrypt the payload
        * *Consequence*. With such a service, confidentiality, data integrity, and source authentication services are provided

    >**NOTE**. This is only a partial list of services, which a network layer could provide, there are countless variations possible

**Best-effort service**. The Internet's network layer provides a best-effort service
* *Explain*.
    * Timing between packets is not guaranteed
    * Packets are not guaranteed to be received in the order, in which they were sent
    * The eventual delivery of transmitted packets is not guaranteed

**ATM network architecture**. Another network architecture defined and implemented service models which go beyond the Internet's best-effort service
* *Idea*. Provide for multiple service models, i.e. different connections can be provided with different classes of service within the same network
* *Important servicer models provided by ATM*.
    * *Constant bit rate (CBR) ATM network service*. Suitable for carrying real-time, constant bit rate audio and video traffic
        * *Goal*. Provide a flow of packets, i.e. cells in ATM terminology, with a virtual pipeline, whose properties are the same as if a dedicated fixed-bandwidth transmission link existed between sending and receiving hosts
        * *Idea*. CBR users declare their bandwidth requirement, i.e. rate, at the time of connection setup

            $\to$ The network reserves that much bandwidth for them, and guarantees their quality of service in terms of cell loss rate, transit relay, and delay variation
        * *Implementation*. A flow of ATM cells is carried across the network so that the following aspects are guaranteed to be less than specified values
            * A cell's end-to-end delay
            * The variability in a cell's end-to-end delay, i.e. the jitter
            * The fraction of cells which are lost or delivered late
        * *Thresholding values agreement*. When the CBR connection is first established 
            
            $\to$ Threshold values are agreed upon the sending host and the ATM network
    * *Variable bit rate (VBR)*. VBR users declare their peak rate and a sustained, i.e. average, rate

        $\to$ As long as they keep their load within the declared parameters, they are guaranteed requested QoS parameters
    * *Available bit rate (ABR) ATM network service*.
        * *Usage*. When users want the network to guarantee cell loss rate, but do not care if they have to wait a little while to get to their destinations
        * *Similarity to the Internet*. Cells may be lost under ABR service
        * *Differences from the Internet*. 
            * Cells cannot be reordered
            * A minimum cell transmission rate (MCR) is guaranteed to a connection using ABR service
                * If the network has enough free resources at a given time

                    $\to$ A sender may also be able to send cells successfully at higher rate than the MCR
            * ABR service can provide feedback to the sender, in terms of a congestion notification bit or an explicit rate at which to send

                $\to$ This is to control how the sender adjusts its rate between the MCR and an allowable peak cell rate
* *CBR, VBR, and ABR*. Similar to services offered by airlines, i.e.
    * *CBR*. A confirmed reservation with not recource if we do not show up
    * *VBR*. A confirmed reservation but we do not pay if we do not show up
    * *ABR*. Standby mode, i.e. we get to go if seats are available

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Traffic contract**. If a network service, or application, wishes to use broadband network, e.g. an ATM network, to transport a particular kind of traffic

$\to$ It must inform the network about what kind of traffic to be transported, and the performance requirements of that traffic, in the form of a traffic contract
* *Traffic descriptor*. When a connection is requested by an application, the application indicates to the network
    * *Type of service required*.

        | ATM service categories | Transfer capability | Typical use |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | Constant bit rate (CBR) | Deterministic bit rate (DBR) | Real-time, QoS guarantees |
        | Real-time variable bit rate (rt-VBR) | For further study | Statistical mux, real time |
        | Non-real-time variable bit rate (rt-VBR) | Statistical bit rate (SBR) | Statistical mux |
        | Available bit rate (ABR) | Available bit rate (ABR) | Resource exploitation, feedback control |
        | Unspecified bit rate (UBR) | No equivalent | Best effort, no guarantees |

    * *Traffic parameters of each data flow in both directions*.
        * *Peak cell rate (PCR)*. The maximum allowable rate, at which cells can be transported along a connection in the ATM network
        * *Sustainable cell rate (SCR)*. A calculation of average allowable, long-term cell transfer rate on a specific connection
        * *Maximum burst size (MBS)*. The maximum allowable burst size of cells which can be transmitted contiguously on a particular connection
            * *Explain*. The maximum number of cells which can be transmitted at the contracted PCR
        * *Minimum cell rate (MCR)*. The minimum allowable rate, at which cells can be transported along an ATM connection
    * *Quality of service (QoS) parameters requested in each direction*.
