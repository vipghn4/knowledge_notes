# Principles of reliable data transfer
**Problem of reliable data transfer**. Occur not only at the transport layer, but also at the link layer and the application layer

$\to$ The general problem is thus of central importance to networking
* *Reliable data transfer model*. The service abstraction provided to the upper-layer entities is the framework of a reliable channel, through which data can be transferred

        <figcaption>Reliable data transfer - Service model and service implementation</figcaption>
    </div>

* *Characterization of reliable data transfer*. 
    * No transferred data bits are corrupted or losta
    * All transferred data are delivered in the order, in which they were sent
* *TCP reliable data transfer*. The reliable data transfer service model provided by TCP is precisely the reliable data transfer model we are discussing

**Reliable data transfer protocol**. Responsible to implement the service abstraction
* *Difficulty*. The layuer below the reliable data transfer protocol may be unreliable
    * *Example*. TCP is a reliable data transfer protocol on top on an unreliable (IP) end-to-end network layer

**Incrementally development of sender and receiver sides of a reliable data transfer protocol**.
* *Idea*. We will consider increasingly complex models of the underlying channel
* *Abstract view on lower layer of the protocol*. The layer beneath the two reliably communicating end points may consist of a single physical link, or a global internetwork

    $\to$ For our purposes, we can view this lower layer simply as an unreliable point-to-point channel
* *Assumption 1*. Packets will be delivered in order, but some of them may be lost
    * *Sending side of the protocol*. Invoked by `rdt_send()` as in the figure above
        
        $\to$ It will pass the data to be delivered to the upper layer at the receiving side
    * *Receiving side of the protocol*. Invoked by `rdt_rcv()` when a packet arrives from the receiving side of the channel

        $\to$ The protocol then delivers data to the upper layer by calling `deliver_data()`
    * *Bidirectional data transfer*. In this section, we only consider unidirectional data transfer
        * *Explain*. Reliable bidirectional data transfer is conceptually no more difficult, but considerably more tedious to explain
    
    >**NOTE**. In addition to exchanging data packets, the sending and receiving sides of `rdt` will also need to exchange control packets back and forth

## Building a reliable data transfer protocol
### Reliable data transfer over a perfectly reliable channel - rdt1.0
**Key assumption**. 
* The underlying channel is completely reliable
* The receiver is able to receive data as fast as the sender happens to send data

    $\to$ There is no need for the receiver to ask the sender to slow down

**Finite-state machine for rdt1.0**. It is important that there are separate FSMs for the sender and for the receiver

<div style="text-align:center">

    <figcaption>Finite-state machine for rdt1.0</figcaption>
</div>

* *Explain the FSM notation*. 
    * The event causing the transition is above the horizontal line labeling the transition
        * When no event occurs and an action is taken, we use $\Lambda$ above the horizontal
    * The actions taken when the event occurs are below the horizontal line
        * When no action is taken on an event, we use $\Lambda$ below the horizontal
* *Key idea*. With a perfectly reliable channel, there is no need for the receiver side to provide any feedback to the sender

### Reliable data transfer over a channel with bit errors - rdt2.0
**Key assumptions**.
* Bits in a packet may be corrupted, due to errors in the physical components of a network as a packet is transmitted, propagates, or is buffered
* All transmitted packets are received in order, in which they were sent

**Automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocols**. Reliable data transfer protocols based on retransmission
* *Message-dictation protocol*. An instance of ARQ 
    * *Idea*. Use both positive acknowledgements, i.e. "OK", and negative acknowledgements, i.e. "Please repeat that"

        $\to$ These control messages allow the receiver to let the sender know what has been recevied correctly, and what has been received in error, thus requires repeating

**Protocol capabilities required in ARQ protocols to handle the presence of bit errors**.
* *Error detection*. A mechanism is required to allow the receiver to detect when bit errors have occurred, e.g. UDP checksum
    * *Idea*. Extra bits, beyond the bits of original data, need to be sent from the sender to the receiver

        $\to$ These bits will be gathered into the packet checksum field of the `rdt2.0` data packet
* *Receiver feedback*. Since the sender the receiver are executing on different end systems

    $\to$ The only way for the sender to learn of the receiver's view of the world is for the receiver to provide explicit feedback to the sender
    * *Example*. Use positive (ACK) and negative (NAK) acknowledgement replies in the message-dictation scenario
    * *Implementation*. Have one bit to indicate ACK or NAK
* *Retransmission*. A packet received in error at the receiver will be retransmitted by the sender

**Finite-state machine for rdt2.0**.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JXAUazK.png">
    <figcaption>Finite-state machine for rdt2.0</figcaption>
</div>

* *Send side*.
    * *Left state*. The send-side protocol is waiting for data to be passed down from the upper layer
    * *Right state*. The send-side protocol is waiting for an ACK or a NAK packet from the receiver

        >**NOTE**. When the sender is in the wait-for-ACK-or-NAK state, it cannot get more data from the upper layer
        >$\to$ The sender can only get more data once it receives an ACK and leaves this state

* *Receive side*. Has only a single state
* *Stop-and-wait protocols*. The sender will not send a new piece of data until it is sure that the receiver has correctly received the current packet

**Corrupted acknowledgement packets**. `rdt2.0` does not account for the possibility that the ACK or NAK packet could be corrupted
* *Idea*. Add checksum bits to ACK/NAK packets to detect the errors
* *How the protocol should recover from errors in ACK or NAK packets*. If an ACK or NAK is corrupted, the sender has no way of knowing whether or not the receiver has correctly received the last piece of transmitted data
* *Approaches to handle corrupted ACKs and NAKs*.
    * *Option 1*. If the speaker did not understand the "OK" or "Please repeat that" message, then he should ask "What did you say?"

        $\to$ The receiver would then repeat the reply
        * *Corrupted "What did you say" message*. The receiver then would respond with "What did you say" message
        * *Consequence*. We are heading down a difficult path
    * *Option 2*. Add enough checksum bits to allow the sender not only to detect, but also to recover from, bit errors

        $\to$ This solves the immediate problem for a channel which can corrupt packets but not lose them
    * *Option 3*. The sender resend the current data packet when it receives a garbled ACK or NAK packet

        $\to$ This introduces duplicate packets into the sender-to-receiver channel
        * *Problem*. The receiver does not know whether the ACK or NAK it last sent was received correctly at the sender

            $\to$ It cannot know a priori whether arriving packet contains new data or is a transmission
        * *Solution*. The sender adds a sequence number to the data packet

            $\to$ The receiver needs only check this sequence number to determine whether or not the received packet is a retransmission
        * *Implementation of sequecne number*. Use a 1-bit sequence number is enough
        * *No packet loss assumption*. Since we assume that there is no packet loss, ACK and NAK packets do not need to indicate the sequence number of the packet they are acknowleding
            * *Explain*. The sender knows that a received ACK or NAK packet, whether garbled or not, was generated in response to its mostly recently transmitted data packet

* *Sender FSM*.

### Reliable data transfer over a lossy channel with bit errors - rdt3.0
**Key assumptions**. In addition to corrupting bits, the underlying channel can lose packets as well
* *Additional concerns*. How to detect packet loss, and what to do when packet loss occurs
* *Idea*. Use checksuming, sequence numbers, ACK packets, and retransmissions to handle "what to do when packet loss occurs"

**Packet loss detection and recovery**. We will put the burden of detecting and recovering from lost packets on the sender
* *Assumption*. The sender transmits a data packet, and either the packet, or the receiver's ACK of that packet, gets lost

    $\to$ No reply is coming at the sender from the receiver
* *Naive solution*. If the sender waits long enough so that it is certain that a packet has been lost

    $\to$ The sender can simply retransmit the data packet
    * *Problems*. 
        * The sender must wait at least as long as a round-trip delay between the sender and receiver, 
            * *Round-trip delay between sender and receiver*. Include buffering at intermediate routers plus time needed to process a packet at the receiver
            * *Consequence*. This worst-case maximum delay is very difficult to estimate, much less know with certainty
        * The protocol should ideally recover from packet loss as soon as possible
* *Timeout solution*. The sender wisely choose a time value, such that packet loss is likely, although not guaranteed, to have happened
    * *Problem*. If a packet experiences a large delay, the sender may retransmit the packet even when neither the data packet nor its ACK have been lost

        $\to$ This leads to duplicate data packets in the sender-to-receiver channel
    * *Solution*. Use sequence number as in `rdt2.2`

    >**NOTE**. From the sender's viewpoint, retransmission is a panacea

    * *Implementation*. Require a countdown timer, which can interrupt the sender after a given amount of time has expired
        * *Sender operations on countdown timer*.
            * Start the timer each time a packet is sent
            * Respond to a timer interrupt
            * Stop the timer

## Pipelined reliable data transfer protocols
**Sender utilization**. The fraction of time the sender is actually busy sending bits into the channel

**Performance bottleneck of stop-and-wait protocol**. The heart of problem of reliable data transfer protocol is the stop-and-wait protocol

**Pipelining**. The solution to the problem of stop-and-wait protocol

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ESHydgt.png">
    <figcaption>Stop-and-wait and pipelined sending</figcaption>
</div>

* *Idea*. The sender is allowed to send multiple packets without waiting for acknowledgements
* *Consequences*.
    * The range of sequence numbers must be increased, since each in-transit packet, not counting retransmission, must have a unique sequence number

        $\to$ There may be multiple, in-transit, unacknowledged packets
    * The sender and receiver sides of the protocols may have to buffer more than one packet
        * *Explain*. Minimally, 
            * The sender will have to buffer packets which have been transmitted but not yet acknowledged
            * The receiver will have to buffer correctly received packets
    * The range of sequence numbers needed and the buffering requirements will depend on the manner, in which a data transfer responds to lost, corrupted, and overly delayed packets

**Basic approaches toward pipelined error recovery**. Go-Back-N and selective repeat

## Go-Back-N (GBN)
**Go-Back-N (GBN) protocol**. 
* The sender is allowed to transmit multiple packets, when available, without waiting for an acknowledgement
* The sender is constrained to have no more than some maximum allowable number $N$ of unacknowledged packets in the pipelineu

**Sender's view of sequence numbers in GBN**.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jv8tZIO.png">
    <figcaption>Sender's view of sequence numbers in GBN</figcaption>
</div>

* *Parameters*.
    * *`base`*. The sequence number of the oldest unacknowledged packet
    * *`nextseqnum`*. The smallest unused sequence number, i.e. the sequence number of the next packet to be sent
* *Intervals of sequence numbers*.
    * *`[0, base-1]`*. Packets which have already been transmitted and acknowledged
    * *`[base, nextseqnum-1]`*. Packets which have been sent but noy acknowedged
    * *`[nextseqnum, base+N-1]`*. Packets which can be sent immediately
    * *`[base+N-1, infty]`*. Packets cannot be used until an unacknowledged packet currently, i.e. packet with sequence number`base`, in the pipeline has been acknowledged
* *Window size*. The range of permissible sequence numbers for transmitted but not yet acknowledged packets can be viewed as a window size of size `N`

    $\to$ `N` is referred to as the window size
* *Purpose*. Limiting the number `N` is for flow control, i.e. congestion control

**Sliding window protocol**. GBN protocol is a sliding-window protocol

**Sequence number**. A packet's sequence number is carried in a fixed-length field in the packet header

$\to$ The range of sequence number is $[0, 2^k-1]$ where $k$ is the number of bits for representing sequence number
* *Consequence*. All arithmetic involving sequence numbers must be done using modulo $2^k$ arithmetic

**Finite-state machine for rdt2.2**.
* *Sender FSM*.

        <figcaption>Finite-state machine for GBN</figcaption>
    </div>

**GBN sender's must-respond events**.
* *Invocation from above*. When `rdt_send()` is called from above, the sender checks to see if the window is full, i.e. whether there are $N$ outstanding, unacknowledged packets
    * If the window is not full, a packet is created and sent, and variables are appropriately updated
    * If the window is full, the sender simply returns the data back to the upper layer

        $\to$ This is an implicit indication that the window is full, and the upper layer would presumably then have to try again later
        * *Real implementation*. The sender would more likely 
            * Have either buffered, but not immediately sent, this data, or 
            * Have a synchronization mechanism, e.g. a semaphore, allowing the upper layer to call `rdt_send()` only when the window is not full

* *Receipt of an ACK*. An acknowledgement for a packet with sequence number $n$ will be taken to be a cumulative acknowledgement
    * *Cumulative acknowledgement*. Indicate that all packets with a sequence number up to, and including $n$, have been correctly received at the receiver
* *A timeout event*. A timer will be used to recover from lost data or acknowledgement packets, i.e.
    * If a timeout occurs, the sender resends all packets which have been previously sent but have not yet been acknowledged
    * If an ACK is received but there are still additional transmitted but not yet acknowledged packets, the timer is restarted
    * If there are no outstanding, unacknowledged packets, the timer is stopped

>**NOTE**. The name "Go-Back-N" is derived from the sender's behavior in the presence of lost or overly delayed packets
>* *Explain*. If the transmitter sends $N$ packets and if the first is lost, then it must resend all the $N$ packets, starting from the first one

**Receiver's actions in GBN**. 
* If a packet with sequence number $n$ is received correctly and is in order

    $\to$ The receiver sends an ACK for packet $n$ and delivers the data portion of the packet to the upper layer
    * *In-order data transfer*. The data last delivered to the upper layer came from a packet with sequence number $n-1$, and the current packet has sequence number $n$
* If all other cases happens, the receiver discards the packet and resends an ACK for the most recently received in-order packet
    * *Explain*. Since packets are delivered one at a time to the upper layer

        $\to$ If packet $k$ has been received and delivered, then all packets with a sequence number lower than $k$ have also been delivered
    * *Consequence*. The use of cumulative acknowledgement is a natural choice for GBN

**Out-of-order packets**. The receiver discards out-of-order packets

$\to$ Initially, it may seem silly and wasteful to discard a correctly received, but out-of-order, packets

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/XfdQEMP.png">
    <figcaption>GBN in operation</figcaption>
</div>

* *Motivation*. The receiver must deliver data in order to the upper layer
    * If packet $n$ is expected but packet $n+1$ arrives
        
        $\to$ The receiver could buffer packet $n+1$ then deliver this packet to the upper layer after it had later received and delivered packet $n$
    * If packet $n$ is lost, both it and packet $n+1$ will eventually be retransmitted as a result of the GBN retransmission rule at the sender

        $\to$ The receiver can discard acket $n+1$
* *Benefits*. The simplicity of receiver buffering

    $\to$ The only information the receiver need to maintain is the sequence number of the next in-order packet
* *Drawbacks*. The subsequent retransmission of the discarded packet may be lost or garbled and thus more retransmission would be required

**Event-based programming**. The various procedures are invoked either by other procedures in the protocol stack, or as the result of an interrupt
* *Events in the sender*.
    * A call from the upper-layer entity to invoke `rdt_send()`
    * A timer interrupt
    * A call from the lower layer to invoke `rdt_rcv()` when a packet arrives

## Selective repeat (SR)
**Problem with GBN**. There are scenarios, in which GBN suffers from performance problems
* *Explain*. 
    * When the window size and bandwidth-delay product are both large, many packets can be in the pipeline

        $\to$ A single packet error can cause GBN to retransmit a large number of packets, many unnecessarily
    * As the probability of channel errors increases, the pipeline can become filled with the unncessary retransmissions

**Selective-repeat protocols**. Avoid unnecessary retransmissions by having the sender retransmit only packets which it suspects were received in error at the receiver

$\to$ The receiver must individually acknowledge correctly received packets

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FKSqFBU.png">
    <figcaption>Selective-repeat (SR) sender and receiver view of sequence number space</figcaption>
</div>

* *Comparison to GBN*.
    * *Difference from GBN*. The sender have already received ACKs for some of the packets in the window, rather than receiving ACKs for all packets up to a sequence number
    * *Similarity with GBN*. A window size of $N$ will again be used to limit the number of outstanding, unacknowledged packets in the pipeline
* *Idea*. The SR receiver will acknowledge a correctly received packet whether or not it is in order

    $\to$ Out-of-order packets are buffered until any missing packets are received, at which point a batch of packets can be delivered in order to the upper layer

**Events and actions of sender and receiver**.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/02wdJW0.png">
    <figcaption>SR operation</figcaption>
</div>

* *Sender*.
    * *Data received from above*. When data is received from above, the SR sender checks the next available sequence number for the packet
        * If the sequence number is within the sender's window

            $\to$ The data is packetized and sent
        * Otherwise, it is either buffered or returned to the upper layer for later transmission, as in GBN
    * *Timeout*. Timers are used to protect against lost packets, with each packet having its own logical timer
        * *Implementation*. A single hardware timer can be used to mimic the operation of multiple logical timers
    * *ACK received*. If an ACK is received, the SR sender marks the packet as having been received, provided it is in the window
        * If the packet's sequence number is equal to `send_base`

            $\to$ The window base is moved forward to the unacknowledged packet with the smallest sequence number
        * If the window moves and there are untransmitted packets with sequence numbers within the current window

            $\to$ These packets are transmitted
* *Receiver*.
    * *Packet with sequence number in `[rcv_base, rcv_base+N-1]` is correctly received*. The received packet falls within the receiver's window and a selective ACK packet is returned to the sender
        * If the packet was not previously received, it is buffered
        * If the packet has a sequence number equal to `rcv_base`
            * This packet, and any previously buffered and consecutively numbered packets are delivered to the upper layer
            * The receive window is then moved forward by the number of packets delivered to the upper layer
    * *Packet with sequence number in `[rcv_base-N, rcv_base-1]` is correctly received*. An ACK must be generated, even though this is a packet which has been acknowledged previously
        * *Explain*. Reacknowledgement is required
    * *Otherwise*. Ignore the packet

**Window synchronization between sender and receiver**. The lack of window synchronization bewteen the sender and receiver windows has important consequences when we are faced with the reality of finite range of sequence numbers
* *Scenario*. 
    * Consider a finite range of sequence numbers $[0,1,2,3]$ and a window size of $3$
    * Suppose packets $0,1,2$ are transmitted and correctly received and acknowledged at the recevier

        $\to$ The receiver's window is now over the fourth, fifth, and sixth packets, i.e. $3,0,1$
* *Case 1*. The ACKs for the first three packets are lost and the sender retransmits these packets

    $\to$ The receiver thus receives a packet with sequence number 0, i.e. a copy of the first packet sent
* *Case 2*. 
    * The ACKs for the first three packets are all delivered correctly

        $\to$ The sender moves its window forward and sends the fourth, fifth, and sixth packets with sequence numbers 3, 0, 1
    * Packet with sequence number 3 is lost, but packet with sequence number 0 arrives, i.e. the one containing new data
* *Observations*.
    * The receiver cannot see the actions taken by the sender

        $\to$ All the receiver observes is the sequence of messages it receives from the channel, and sends into the channel
    * Thus, the two scenarios are identical, i.e. there is no way to distinguishing the retransmission of the first packet, from an original transmission of the fifth packet
* *Solution*. The window size must be less than or equal to half the size of the sequence number space for SR protocols
    * *Explain*. At each time, the receiver has to cope with packets within `[rcv_base-N, rcv_base+N-1]`

        $\to$ The sequence number for all packets within this range must be different

**Summary**.

    <figcaption>Summary of reliable data transfer mechanisms and their use</figcaption>
</div>

**Packet reordering**. When the channel connecting the two is a network, rather than a physical wire, packet reordering can occur
* *Example*. Old copies of a packet with a sequence or acknowledgement number of $x$ can appear

    $\to$ Even though neither the sender's nor the receiver's window contains $x$
    * *Explain*. The channel can buffer packets and spontaneously emit these packets at any point in the future

        $\to$ Since sequence numbers may be reused, some care must be taken to guard against such duplicate packets
* *Practical solution*. Ensure that a sequence number is not reused until the sender is "sure" that any previously sent packets with sequence number $x$ are no longer in the network
    * *Idea*. Assume that a packet cannot live in the network for longer than some fixed maximum amount of time, e.g. 3 minutes as in TCP

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Bandwidth-delay product**. The product of a data link's capacity, i.e. bits per second, and its round-trip delay time, i.e. in seconds

$\to$ The result is the maximum amount of data on the network circuit at any given time, i.e. data which has been transmitted but not yet acknowledged

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/cQU0da2.png">
    <figcaption>Bandwidth-delay product</figcaption>
</div>

* *High bandwidth-delay product*. An important problem case in the design of protocols such as TCP
    * *Optimal throughput*. The protocol can only achieve optimum throughput if a sender sends a sufficiently large quantity of data, before being required to stop and wait until a confirming message is received from the receiver, acknowleding the recept of the data
        * *Explain*. If the quantity of data sent is insufficient compared with the bandwidth-delay product

            $\to$ The link is not being kept busy and the protocol is operating below peak effiency of the link
* *BDP in general*. The amount of data or packets to fill the "pipe"

    $\to$ Think of the link as a pipe, i.e. with "delay" axis and "bandwidth" axis, then how much data is required to fill this pipe
