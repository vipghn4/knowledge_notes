# DNS - The Internet's directory service
**Internet hosts identification**. Internet hosts can be identified in many ways
* *Hostname*. Names which are mnemonic and appreciated by human
    * *Example*. `cnn.com`, `www.yahoo.com`, `cis.poly.edu`
    * *Drawbacks*. 
        * Hostnames provide little, if any, information about the location within the Internet of the host
        * Hostnames can consist of variable length alphenumeric characters

            $\to$ They would be difficult to process by routers
* *IP addresses*. A method for hosts addressing which overcomes drawbacks of hostnames
    * *IP address structure*. IP address (IPv4) consists of four-bytes, i.e. 32-bit, and has a rigid hierarchical structure
        * *Example*. `121.7.106.83`
        * *Hierachical structure of IP address*. We scan the address from left to right to obtain more and more specific information about where the host is located in the Internet
            * *Explain*. Within which network, in the network of networks
            * *Analogue example*. When we scan a postal address from bottom to top, we obtain more and more specific information about where the addressee is located

## Services provided by DNS
**Domain name system (DNS)**. To reconcile the preference of using hostname, we need a directory service which translates hostnames to IP addresses

$\to$ This is the main task of the Internet's domain name system (DNS)
* *Domain name system (DNS) definition*. 
    * *Definition 1*. A distributed database implemented in a hierarchy of DNS servers
    * *Definition 2*. An application-layer protocol which allows hosts to query the distributed database
* *DNS servers*. Often UNIX machines running the Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) software
* *DNS protocol*. Run over UDP and uses port 53
* *Usage*. Employed by other application-layer protocols, e.g. HTTP, SMTP, FTP, etc. to translate user-supplied hostnames to IP addresses
    * *Example*. 
        1. A browser, i.e. HTTP client, running on some user's host, requests the URL `www.someschool.edu/index.html`
        2. For the user's host to be able to send an HTTP request message to the Web server `www.someschool.edu`, the user's host must obtain the IP address of `wwww.someschool.edu`
    * *Hostname-to-IP-address translation procedure*. Consider the example above
        1. The same user machine runs the client side of the DNS application
        2. The browser extracts the host name, i.e. `www.someschool.edu`, from the URL and passes the hostname to the client side of the DNS application
        3. The DNS client sends a query containing the hostname to a DNS server
        4. The DNs client eventually receives a reply, including IP address for the hostname
        5. Once the browser receives the IP address from DNS, it can initiate a TCP connection to the HTTP server process located at port 80 at that IP address
    * *Consequence*. DNS adds an additional delay, sometimes substantial, to the Internet application using it

        $\to$ However, the desired IP address is often cached by a nearby DNS server, helping to reduce DNS network traffic and the average DNS delay

**Other services provided by DNS**.
* *Host aliasing*. A host with a complicated hostname can have one or more alias names
    * *Example*. A hostname like `relay1.west-coast.enterprise.com` could have two aliases `enterprise.com` and `www.enterprise.com`
    * *Canonical hostname*. The original hostname
    * *DNS responsibility*. DNS can be invoked by an application to obtain the canonical hostname for a supplied alias hostname, as well as the IP address of the host
* *Mail server aliasing*. It is highly desirable that e-mail addresses be mnemonic, e.g. `bob@hotmail.com`
    * *Problem*. The hostname of Hotmail mail server is more complicated and much less mnemonic than simply `hotmail.com`
    * *Solution*. DNS can be invoked by a mail application to obtain the canonical hostname for a supplied alias hostname, as well as the IP address of the host
        * *MX record*. Permit a company's mail server and Web server to have identical (aliased) hostnames, e.g. both be `enterprise.com`, via mail server hostname aliasing
* *Load distribution*. DNS is also used to perform load distribution among replicated servers, e.g. replicated web servers
    * *Replicated Web servers*. Busy sites, e.g. `cnn.com`, are replicated over multiple servers, each of which runs on a different end system with a different IP address

        $\to$ A set of IP addresses, i.e. contained within the DNS database, is thus associated with one canonical hostname
    * *DNS resposibility*. When clients make a DNS query for a name mapped to a set of addresses

        $\to$ The server responds with the entire set of IP addresses, but rotates the ordering of the addresses within each reply
        * *Consequence*. A client typically sends its HTTP request message to the IP address listed first

            $\to$ DNS rotation distributes the traffic among the replicated servers
    
    >**NOTE**. DNS rotation is also used for e-mail so that multiple mail servers can have the same alias name

    >**NOTE**. Content distribution companies, e.g. Akamai, have used DNS is a more sophisticated ways to provide Web content distirbution

* *Reference detail documentations*. RFC 1034, RFC 1035, and updated in several additional RFCs

## Overview of how DNS works
**DNS from perspective of user applications**.
* *Hostname-to-IP-address translation procedure*.
    1. Some application running in a user's host needs to translate a hostname to an IP address
    2. The application invokes the client side of DNS, specifying the hostname needing to be translated
        * *Example*. `gethostbyname()` in UNIX-based machines
    3. DNS in the user's host then takes over, sending a query message into the network
    4. All DNS query and reply messages are sent within UDP datagrams to port 53
    5. After a delay, ranging from milliseconds to seconds, DNS in user's host receives a DNS reply message providing the desired mapping
    6. The mapping is passed to the invoking application
* *DNS from perspective of user applications*. The DNS is a block box providing a simple, straightforward translation service

    $\to$ In fact, the black box implementing the service is complex, consisting of a large number of DNS servers distributed around the globe, as well as an application-layer protocol specifying how the DNS servers and querying host communicate

**Centralized design of DNS**. This is a simple design for DNS, where one DNS server contains all the mappings

$\to$ CLients simply direct all queries to the single DNS server, and the DNS server responds directly to the querying clients
* *Drawback*. With its vast and growing number of hosts, this design is not appropriate for today's Internet, i.e.
    * *A single point of failure*. If the DNS server crashes, so does the entire Internet
    * *Traffic volume*. A single DNS server would have to handle all DNS queries
    * *Distant centralized database*. A sinel DNS server cannot be close to all querying clients

        $\to$ This can lead to significant delays
    * *Maintenance*. The DNS server have to keep records for all the Internet hosts

        $\to$ This centralized database is huge and must be updated frequently to account for every new host
* *Conclusion*. Centralized design for DNS does not scale

### A distributed, hierarchical database
**DNS structure**. To deal with the issue of scale, the DNS uses a large number of servers, organized in a hierarchical fashion, and distributed around the world
* *Mapping distribution*. No single DNS server has all of the mappings for all of the hosts in the Internet

    $\to$ The mappings are distributed across the DNS servers
* *Classes of DNS servers (first approximation)*. There are three classes of DNS servers organized in a hierarchy

    <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Pl1U8e5.png">
        <figcaption>Portion of the hierarchy of DNS servers</figcaption>
    </div>

    * *Root DNS servers*. In the Internet, there are several root DNS servers (A through M), most of which are located in North America

        <div style="text-align:center">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/XERYOuA.png">
            <figcaption>Portion of the hierarchy of DNS servers</figcaption>
        </div>

        >**NOTE**. Each server is actually a network of replicated servers, for both security and reliability purposes

    * *Top-level domain (TLD) DNS servers*. Responsible for top-level domains, e.g. `com`, `org`, `net`, etc. and all of the country top-level domains, e.g. `uk`, `fr`, `ca`, etc.
        * *Famous DNS comapnies*.
            * *Verisign Global Registry Service*. Maintain the TLD servers for the `com` top-level domain
            * *Educause*. Maintain the TLD servers for the `edu` top-level domain
    * *Authoritative DNS servers*. Every organization with publicly accessible hosts on the Internet must provide publicly accessible DNS records mapping the names of those hosts to IP addresses

        $\to$ An organization's authoritative DNs server houses these DNS records
        * *Self-implemented DNS server*. An organization can choose to implement its own authoritative DNS server to hold these records
        * *Paid DNS server*. The organization can pay to have these records stored in an authoritative DNS server of some service provider
* *How classes of DNS servers interact*. Suppose a DNS client wants to determine the IP address for the hostname `www.amazon.com`
    1. The client first contacts one of the root servers, which returns the IP address for TLD servers for the top-level domain `com`
    2. The client then contacts one of these TLD servers, which returns the IP address of an authoritative server for `amazon.com`
    3. The client contacts one of the authoritative servers for `amazon.com`, which returns the IP address for the hostname `www.amazon.com`

**Local DNS server**. Another important type of DNS server

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/VtInoSS.png">
    <figcaption>Interaction of the various DNS servers</figcaption>
</div>

* *Position in the hierarchy of DNS servers*. A local DNS server does not strictly belong to the hierarchy of DNS servers, but is central to the DNS architecture
    * *Explain*. Each ISP, e.g. university, etc. has a local DNS server, i.e. default name server

        $\to$ When a host connects to an ISP, the ISP provides the host with the IP address of one or more of its local DNS servers, typically via DHCP
* *Local DNS server of a host*. Typically close to the host
    * *For institutional ISP*. The local DNS server may be on the same LAN as the host
    * *For residential ISP*. Typically separated from the host by no more than a few routers
* *Functionality*. When a host makes a DNS query, the query is sent to the local DNS server

    $\to$ The local DNS server acts as a proxy, forwarding the query into the DNS server hierarchy

**Knowledge of TLD server about the authoritative DNS servers**. Previously, we assume that the TLD server knows the authoritative DNS sever for the hostname

$\to$ This is generally not always true
* *Explain*. The TLD server may know only of an intermediate DNS server, which in turn knows the authoritative DNS server for the hostname

**Recursive and iterative queries**. Querying for translation from hostname to IP address makes use of both recursive and iterative queries
* *Recursive query*. $A$ queries $B$, making $B$ query $C$ for the answer to reply $A$
* *Iterative query*. $A$ queries $B$ for answer, then $C$ for answer

### DNS caching
**DNS caching**. A critically important feature of the DNS system
* *Purpose*. Extensively exploited by DNS to improve the delay performance and to reduce the number of DNS messages ricochating around the Internet

**Idea**. In a query chain, when a DNS server receives a DNS reply containing (for example) a mapping from a hostname to an IP address

$\to$ It can cache the mapping in its local memory
* *Consequence*. If a hostname / IP address pair is cached in a DNS server, and a query arrives to the DNS server for the same hostname

    $\to$ The DNS server can provide desired IP address, even if it is not authoritative for the hostname
* *Lifetime of a cached mapping*. DNS servers discard cached information after a period of time, often set to two days

## DNS records and messages
### DNS record
**Resource records (RRs)**. The DNS servers which together implement the DNS distributed database store RRs, including RRs providing hostname-to-IP-address mappings

$\to$ Each DNS reply message carries one or more resource records
* *Resource record format*. A four-tuple of the form `(Name, Value, Type, TTL)` 
    * *`TTL`*. The time to live of the resource record, i.e. when a resource should be removed from a cache
    * *Meaning tpy `Name`, `Value`, and `Type`*.
        * *If `Type=A`*. `Name` is a hostname and `Value` is the IP address for the hostname

            $\to$ A type `A` record provides the standard hostname-to-IP-address mappings
        * *If `Type=NS`*. `Name` is a domain, e.g. `foo.com`, and `Value` is the hostname of an authoritative DNS server knowing how to obtain the IP addresses for hosts in the domain

            $\to$ This record is used to route DNS queries further along in the query chain
        * *If `Type=CNAME`*. `Value` is a canonical hostname for the alias hostname `Name`

            $\to$ This record provides querying hosts trhe canonical name for a hostname
        * *If `Type=MX`*. `Value` is the canonical name of a mail server, which has an alias hostname `Name`

            $\to$ MX records allow the hostnames of mail servers to have similar aliases

            >**NOTE**. By using the MX record, a company can have the same aliased name for its mail server and for one of its other servers

**DNS server and DNS record**.
* If a DNS server is authoritative for a particular hostname, The DNS server will contain a type `A` record for that hostname

    >**NOTE**. Even if the DNS server is not authoritative, it may contain a tyep `A` record in its cache

* If a sever is not authoritative for a hostname 
    * It will contain a type `NS` for the domain which includes the hostname
    * It will contain a type `A` record providing the IP address of the DNS server in `Value` field of the `NS` record

### DNS message
**Types of DNS messages**. Query and reply messages

**DNS message format**.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="...">
    <figcaption>DNS message format</figcaption>
</div>

* *Header section*. The first 12 bytes representing a number of fields
    * *Query identification*. A 16-bit number
        * *Usage*. Copied into the reply message to a query, allowing the client to match received replies with sent queries
    * *Flags*. Consists of 4 bits
        * A 1-bit query/reply flag indicating whether the message is query (0) or reply (1)
        * A 1-bit authoritative flag is set in a reply message when a DNS server is an authoritative server for the queried name
        * A 1-bit recursion-desired flag is set when a client, i.e. host or DNS server, desires that the DNS server perform recursion when it does not have the record
        * A 1-bit recursion-available field is set in a reply if the DNS server supports recursion
    * *Four number-of fields*. Indicate the number of occurrences of four types of data sections which follow the header
* *Question section*. Contain information about the query being made. This section consists of 
    * *A name field*. Contain the name being queried
    * *A type field*. Indicate the type of question being asked about the name, e.g. a host address associated with a name (type A), or the mail server for a name (type MX)
* *Answer section (in a reply from a DNS server)*. Contain the resource records for the name queried
    * *Number of resource records*. A reply can return multiple RRs in the answer, since a hostname can have multiple IP addresses
* *Authority section*. Contain records of the other authoritative servers
* *Additional section*. Contain other helpful records, e.g. 
    * *Example*. The answer field in a reply to an MX query contains a RR providing the canonical hostname of a mail server

        $\to$ The additional section contains a Type A record providing the IP address for the canonical hostname of the mail server

**Sending a DNS query directly from the working host to some DNS server**. We `nslookup` program, which is available from most Windows and UNIX platforms
* *Functionality*. After invoking `nslookup`, we can send a DNS query to any DNS server (root, TLD, or authoritative)

    $\to$ After receiving the reply message from the DNS server, `nslookup` will display the records included in the reply (in a human-readable format)

### Inserting records into the DNS database
**DNS registration**. Support we just created an exciting new company, we register the domain name `company.com` at a registrar
* *Registrar*. A commercial entity which 
    1. Verify the uniqueness of the domain name
    2. Enter the domain name into the DNS database
    3. Collect a small fee from us for its service
* *Inputs provided to the registrar*. The names and IP addresses of our primary and secondary authoritative DNS servers, e.g. `dns1.company.com`, `dns2.company.com`, `212.212.212.1`, and `212.212.212.2`
    * For each of these two authoritative DNS servers
        
        $\to$ The registrar will make sure that a Type NS and a Type A record are entered into the TLD `com` server
    * For the primary authoritative server, the registrar will insert the following resources into the DNS system
        * `(company.com, dns1.company.com, NS)`, i.e. for people to asks `dns1.company.com` for your IP address from hostname
        * `(dns1.company.com, 212.212.212.1, A)`, i.e. for people to translate `dns1.company.com` to `212.212.212.1` to make requests for the IP address of `company.com`
    * Our Type A RR for our Web server `company.com` and the Type MX RR for our mail server `mail.company.com` are entered into our authoritative DNS servers

**Post-registration**. Once all the above steps are completed, people can visit our Web site and send e-mail to the employees at our company

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Request for Comments (RFC)**. A publication from the Internet Society (ISOC) and its associated bodies, most prominently the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the principal technical development and standards-setting bodies for the Internet

**Changing DNS server in local PC**. 
* *Problems*. 
    * There are many DNS servers, and we may end up using a server which juts has limited information about the Internet
        * *Example*. The DNS server provided by our ISP may block certain domains for various reasons
    * DNS servers can be used for a man-in-the-middle attack, where we are not sent to the right IP address, but end up at some other server

        $\to$ Hackers can listen in on everything we do on the website as they just forward all requests and responses between us and the real site while recording it all
* *Consequence*. The DNS server decides where we will end up when we starting browsing the Internet

    $\to$ Changing the DNS server will chang which parts of the Internet will be accessible for us and how secure we will be

## Discussion
**DNS - critical network functions via the client-server paradigm**.
* *DNS as an application-layer protocol*. DNS, like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP, is an application-protocol since
    * DNS runs between communicating end systems using the client-server paradigm
    * DNS relies on an underlying end-to-end transport protocol to transfer DNS messages between communicating end systems
* *DNS and Web*. The role of the DNS is different from Web, file transfer, and e-mail applications
    * *Explain*. The DNS is not an application, with which a user directly interacts

        $\to$ The DNS provides a core Internet function, i.e. translating hostnames to their underlying IP addresses
