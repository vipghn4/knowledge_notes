# Introduction and transport-layer services
**Logical communication**. A transport-layer protocol provides for logical communication beteen application processes running on different hosts

* *Logical communication*. From an application's perspective, it is as if the host running the processes were directly connected
    * *Usage*. Used by application processes to send messages to each other, free from the worry of the details of the physical infrastructure used to carry messages
* *Why "logical" communication*. Transport-layer protocols are implemented in the end systems, but not in the network routers

**Transport layer in sending and receiving sides**.
* *Sending side*. The transport layer converts the application-layer messages recevied from a sending process into transport-layer packets
    * *Transport-layer segment production*. 
        1. Break the application messages into smaller chunks
        2. Add a transport-layer header to each chunk to create a transport-layer segment
    * *Interaction with network layer*. Transport-layer segments are passed to the network layer at the sending end system
        
        $\to$ The segment is then encapsulated within a network-layer packet, i.e. a datagram, and sent to the destination
    
    >**NOTE**. Network routers act only on the network-layer fields of the datagram
    >* *Explain*. They do not examine the fields of the transport-layer segment encapsulated with the datagram

    * *Transport-layer segment*. A transport-layer packet
* *Receiving side*. The network layer extracts the transport-layer segment from the datagram and passes the segment up to the transport layer

    $\to$ The transport layer then processes the received segment, making the data in the segment available to the receiving application

## Relationship between transport and network layers
**Logical communication provided by transport and network layers**.
* *Transport-layer protocol*. Provide logical communication between processes running on different hosts

    $\to$ Transport protocol moves messages from application processes to the network edge, i.e. the network layer, and vice versa
* *Network-layer protocol*. Provide logical communication between hosts

**Transport protocols**. A computer network may make available multiple transport protocols, each protocol offering a different service model to applications
* *Constraints on transport protocols*. Services provided by a transport protocol are often constrained by the service model of the underlying network-layer protocol
    * *Example*. If the network-layer protocol cannot provide delay or bandwidth guarantees for transport-layer segments sent between hosts

        $\to$ The transport-layer protocol cannot provide delay or bandwidth guarantees for application messages sent between hosts
* *Services provided by transport protocol without being supported by network protocol*. Certain services can be offered by a transport protocol, even when the underlying network protocol does not offer the corresponding service at the network layer
    * *Example*. A transport protocol can offer reliable data transfer service to application, even when the underlying network protocol is unreliable

## Overview of the transport layer in the Internet
**Brief introduction about the Internet's network layer**.
* *Internet protocol (IP)*. The network layer protocol
    * *Responsibilities*. Provide logical communication between hosts
    * *Best-effort delivery service*. The IP service model is a best-offer delivery service
        * *Explain*. IP makes its best effort to deliver segments between communicating hosts, but it makes no guarantees

            $\to$ IUP does not guarantee orderly delivery of segments, and it does not guarantee the integrity of the data in the segments
        * *Consequence*. IP is an unreliable service
* *IP address*. Every host has at least one network-layer address


**User datagram protocol (UDP) and Transmission control protocol (TCP)**.
* *UDP and TCP*.
    * *UDP*. Provide an unreliable, connectionless service to the invoking application
    * *TCP*. Provide a reliable, connection-oriented service to the invoking application
* *Similarities*.
    * *The most fundamental responsibility*. Extend IP's delivery service between two end systems to a delivery service between two processes running on the end systems
        * *Transport-layer multiplexing and demultiplexing*. The activity of extending host-to-host delivery to process-to-process delivery
    * *Integrity checking*. UDP and TCP provide integrity checking by including error-detection fields in their segments' headers
* *Differences*. 
    * *UDP*. Only provide minimal services, i.e. the two features listed above
    * *TCP*. Offer several additional services to applications
        * *Reliable data transfer*. TCP provides reliable data transfer
            * *Idea*. Use flow control, sequence numbers, acknowledgements, and timers

                $\to$ TCP ensures that data is delivered from sending process to receiving process, correctly and in order
        * *Congestion control*. TCP congestion control prevents any one TCP connection from swamping the links and routers between communicating hosts with an excessive amount of traffic
            * *Idea*. Strive to give each connection traversing a congested link an equal share of the link bandwidth
            * *Implementation*. Regulate the rate, at which the sending sides of TCP connections can send traffic into the network

**Complexity of TCP**. TCP is necessarily complex, due to the additional services

**Data segment terminology**. In an Internet context, we refer to the transport-layer packets as a segment
* *TCP terminology*. A data segment is refered as a *segment*
* *UDP terminology*. A data segment is refered as a *datagram*

    $\to$ But this terminology is used for network-layer packet
