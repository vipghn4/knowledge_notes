# Introduction to link layer
**Brief**. The network layer provides a communication service between any two network hosts

$\to$ Between the two hosts, datagrams travel over a series of communication links, some wired and some wireless
* *Communication links travelled by the datagrams*. 
    1. Starting at the source host
    2. Passing through a series of packet switches, i.e. switches and routers
    3. Ending at the destination host
* *Questions of interest*.
    * How packets are sent across the individual links, which make up the end-to-end communication path
    * How are the network-layer datagrams encapsulated in the link-layer frames for transmission over a single link
    * Are different link-layer protocols used in the different links along the communication path
    * How are transmission conflicts in broadcast links resolved
    * Is there addressing at the link layer and, if so, how does the link-layer addressing operate with the network-layer addressing
    * What exactly is the difference between a switch and a router

**Two fundamentally types of link-layer channels**.
* *Broadcast channels*. Connect multiple hosts in wireless LANs, satellite networks, and hybrid fiber-coaxial cable (HFC) access networks
    * *Medium access protocol*. Since many hosts are connected to the same broadcast communication channel
        
        $\to$ A medium access protocol is needed to coordinate frame transmission
        * A central controller may be used to coordinate transmissions, or
        * The hosts themselves coordinate transmissions
* *Point-to-point communication link*. This is often found between two routers connected by a long-distance link, or between a user’s office computer and the nearby Ethernet switch to which it is connected
    * *Coordinating access to a point-to-point link*. This is simpler

**Terminology**
* *Node*. Any device that runs a link-layer protocol
    * *Examples*. Nodes include hosts, routers, switches, and WiFi access points
* *Links*. The communication channels connecting adjacent nodes along the communication path
    * *Consequence*. In order for a datagram to be transferred from source host to destination host
        
        $\to$ It must be moved over each of the individual links in the end-to-end path
* *Link-layer frame*. Over a given link, a transmitting node encapsulates the datagram in a link-layer frame 
    
    $\to$ The node then transmits the frame into the link

## The services provided by the link layer
**Brief**. Although the basic service of any link layer is to move a datagram from one node to an adjacent node over a single communication link

$\to$ The details of the provided service can vary from one link-layer protocol to the next

**Possible services offered by a link-layer protocol**.
* *Framing*. Almost all link-layer protocols encapsulate each network-layer datagram within a link-layer frame before transmission over the link
    * *Link-layer frame*. Consist of a data field, in which the network-layer datagram is inserted, and a number of header fields
        * *Frame structure*. Specified by the link-layer protocol
* *Link access*. A medium access control (MAC) protocol specifies the rules, by which a frame is transmitted onto the link
    * *Point-to-point links with one sender at one end of the link and one receiver at the other end of the link*. The MAC protocol is simple, or nonexisten
        * *Explain*. the sender can send a frame whenever the link is idle
    * *Broadcast links*. When multiple nodes share a single broadcast link, we have a multiple access problem
        * *Multiple access problem*. The MAC protocol serves to coordinate the frame transmissions of the many nodes
* *Reliable delivery*. When a link-layer protocol provides reliable delivery service, it guarantees to move each network-layer datagram across the link without error
    * *Compared with transport-layer reliable delivery*. Certain transport-layer protocols, e.g. TCP, provide a reliable delivery service
        
        $\to$ Like a transport-layer reliable delivery service, a link-layer reliable delivery service can be achieved with acknowledgments and retransmissions
    * *Usage*. Often used for links that are prone to high error rates, e.g. a wireless link
        * *Purposes*. Correct the errors locally, i.e. on the link where the error occurs, rather than forcing an end-to-end retransmission of the data by a transport- or application-layer protocol
    * *Drawback*. Introduce unnecessary overhead for low bit-error links, including fiber, coax, and many twisted-pair copper links
            
        $\to$ Many wired link-layer protocols do not provide a reliable delivery service
* *Error detection and correction*. The link-layer hardware in a receiving node can incorrectly decide that a bit in a frame is zero when it was transmitted as a one, and vice versa
    
    $\to$ Such bit errors are introduced by signal attenuation and electromagnetic noise
    * *Error detection*. Since there is no need to forward a datagram that has an error
        
        $\to$ Many link-layer protocols provide a mechanism to detect such bit errors
        * *Idea*. 
            * The transmitting node includes error-detection bits in the frame
            * The receiving node perform an error check
        * *Implementation*. Error detection in the link layer is usually more sophisticated and is implemented in hardware
    * *Error correction*. Similar to error detection, but the receiver also determines exactly where in the frame the errors have occurred, then corrects these errors

## Where is the link layer implemented
>**NOTE**. We learned in Chapter 4 that the link layer is implemented in a router’s line card

**Typical host architecture**.

* *Network interface card (NIC)*. For the most part, the link layer is implemented in a network adapter, i.e. the NIC
    * *Link-layer controller*. The heart of the network adapter, which is usually a single, special-purpose chip that implements many of the link-layer services, e.g. framing, link access, error detection, etc.
        
        $\to$ Much of a link-layer controller’s functionality is implemented in hardware
* *Data flow*.
    * *Sending side*.
        1. The controller takes a datagram that has been created and stored in host memory by the higher layers of the protocol stack
        2. The controller encapsulates the datagram in a link-layer frame, i.e. filling in the frame’s various fields
        3. The controller transmits the frame into the communication link, following the link-access protocol
    * *Receiving side*.
        1. The controller receives the entire frame, and extracts the network-layer datagram
        2. If the link layer performs error detection, then the sending controller sets the error-detection bits in the frame header

            $\to$ The receiving controller performs error detection
* *Software components of the link layer*. Implement higher-level linklayer functionality, e.g. assembling link-layer addressing information and activating the controller hardware
    * *Link-layer softwares at the receiving side*. 
        * Respond to controller interrupts, e.g., due to the receipt of one or more frames
        * Handle error conditions and passing a datagram up to the network layer
* *Conclusion*. The link layer is a combination of hardware and software—the place in the protocol stack, where software meets hardware
