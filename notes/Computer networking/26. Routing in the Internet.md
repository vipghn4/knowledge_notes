# Routing in the Internet
**Internet’s routing protocols**. Determine the path taken by a datagram between source and destination

**Autonomous system (AS) - Recall**. A collection of routers under the same administrative and technical control

$\to$ These routers all run the same routing protocol among themselves
* *Subnets*. Each AS typically contains multiple subnets

## Intra-AS routing in the Internet - RIP
**Intra-AS routing protocol (or interior gateway protocol)**. Ised to determine how routing is performed within an AS
* *Common intra-AS routing protocols* Historically, two routing protocols have been used extensively for intra-AS routing in the Internet
    * Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
    * Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)

**Routing Information Protocol (RIP)**.
* *History*. RIP was one of the earliest intra-AS Internet routing protocols and is still in widespread use today
    * *Motivation*. It traces its origins and its name to the Xerox Network Systems (XNS) architecture
    * *Popularity of RIP*. The widespread deployment of RIP was due in great part to its inclusion in 1982 in the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) version of UNIX supporting TCP/IP
    * *RIP version 1*. Defined in RFC 1058, with a backwardcompatible version 2 defined in RFC 2453
* *RIP as a DV protocol*. A distance-vector protocol similar to the idealized DV protocol
    * *Cost metric for DV*. The version of RIP specified in RFC 1058 uses hop count as a cost metric
        * *Link cost*. Each link has a cost of 1
        * *Cost computation in RIP*. Costs are actually from source router to a destination subnet
    * *Hop*. The number of subnets traversed along the shortest path from source router to destination subnet, including the destination subnet
        * *Maximum cost of a path*. Limited to 15, i.e. the use of RIP is limited to ASes with fewer than 15 hops in diameter
    * *Propagation of DV information*
        * *DV protocols*. Neighboring routers exchange distance vectors with each other
            
            $\to$ The DV for any one router is the current estimate of the shortest path distances from that router to the subnets in the AS
        * *RIP*. Routing updates are exchanged between neighbors approximately every 30 seconds using a RIP response message
            * *RIP response message (or RIP advertisements)*. Sent by a router or host, and contain 
                * A list of up to 25 destination subnets within the AS, and
                * The sender’s distance to each of those subnets

**RIP table**. Each router maintains a RIP table, i.e. a routing table
* *Routing table structure*. Include both the router’s distance vector and the router’s forwarding table
    
    $\to$ There are three columns
    * One column for the destination subnet
    * One column indicates the identity of the next router along the shortest path to the destination subnet
    * One column indicates the number of hops to get to the destination subnet along the shortest path
        
        $\to$ This is the number of subnets that have to be traversed, including the destination subnet
* *Number of rows in RIP table*. In principle, a routing table will have one row for each subnet in the AS
    
    >**NOTE**. RIP version 2 allows subnet entries to be aggregated using route aggregation technique

**Implementation aspects of RIP**. 
* *Node failure detection*. If a router does not hear from its neighbor at least once every 180 seconds
    
    $\to$ That neighbor is considered to be no longer reachable
    * *Explain*. Either the neighbor has died or the connecting link has gone down
        * *Motivation*. RIP routers exchange advertisements approximately every 30 seconds
    * *Reaction to node failure*. 
        1. RIP modifies the local routing table
        2. RIP propagates this information by sending advertisements to its neighboring routers, i.e. the reachable ones
    
    >**NOTE**. A router can request information about its neighbor’s cost to a given destination using RIP’s request message

* *Transport protocol used by RIP*. Routers send RIP request and response messages to each other over UDP using port number 520
    
    $\to$ The UDP segment is carried between routers in a standard IP datagram
    
    >**NOTE**. This may seem rather convoluted

**Implementation of RIP in a UNIX system**. Consider a UNIX workstation serving as a router

<div style="text-align:center">

    <figcaption>Implementation of RIP as the routed daemon</figcaption>
</div>

* *Routed process*. A routed process executes RIP, i.e. maintains routing information and exchanges messages with routed processes running in neighboring routers
* *Message exchange between routed processes*. Since RIP is implemented as an application-layer process 
    
    $\to$ It can send and receive messages over a standard socket and use a standard transport protocol

## Intra-AS routing in the Internet - OSPF
**Brief**. 
* *RIP and OSPF*. Like RIP, OSPF routing is widely used for intra-AS routing in the Internet
    * *OSPF and its closely related cousin IS-IS*. Typically deployed in upper-tier ISPs
    * *RIP*. Deployed in lower-tier ISPs and enterprise networks
* *Openness in OSPF*. The routing protocol specification is publicly available
* *Most recent version of OSPF*. Version 2, which is defined in RFC 2328, i.e. a public document

**Main functionality of OSPF**. A link-state protocol using flooding of link-state information and a Dijkstra least-cost path algorithm
* *Dijkstra algorithm for finding least-cost path*. A router constructs a complete topological map, i.e. a graph, of the entire AS
    
    $\to$ The router locally runs Dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm to determine a shortest-path tree to all subnets, with itself as the root node
    * *Individual link cost*. Configured by the network administrator
        * *Examples*.
            * Set all link costs to 1, achieving minimum-hop routing, or
            * Set the link weights to be inversely proportional to link capacity to discourage traffic from using low-bandwidth links
        * *Freedom in link weights configuration*. OSPF does not mandate a policy for how link weights are set
            
            $\to$ This is the job of the network administrator
    * *Conclusion*. OSPF provides the mechanisms, i.e. protocol, for determining least-cost path routing for the given set of link weights
* *Flooding of link-state information*. A router broadcasts routing information to all other routers in the AS, not just to its neighboring routers
    * *Information broadcasting time*. 
        * A router broadcasts linkstate information whenever there is a change in a link’s state
        * A router broadcasts a link’s state periodically, even if the link’s state has not changed
            * *Purposes (from RFC 2328)*. Add robustness to the link state algorithm
    * *Protocol for OSPF advertisements*. Advertisements are contained in OSPF messages carried directly by IP, with an upper-layer protocol of 89 for OSPF
        
        $\to$ The OSPF protocol must itself implement functionality like reliable message transfer and link-state broadcast
* *Other functionalities*.
    * The OSPF protocol checks that links are operational and allows an OSPF router to obtain a neighboring router’s database of network-wide link state
        * *Explain*. Checking for links' operational can be done via a HELLO message sent to an attached neighbor

**Some advances embodied in OSPF**.
* *Security*. Exchanges between OSPF routers, e.g. link-state updates, can be authenticated
    * *Router authentication*. Only trusted routers can participate in the OSPF protocol within an AS
        
        $\to$ This prevents malicious intruders from injecting incorrect information into router tables
        * *Default authentication mode*. By default, OSPF packets between routers are not authenticated and could be forged
    * *Types of authentication*. Can be configured, i.e. simple and MD5
        * *Simple authentication*. The same password is configured on each router
            
            $\to$ When a router sends an OSPF packet, it includes the password in plaintext
            * *Drawback*. This is not very secure
        * *MD5 authentication*. Based on shared secret keys configured in all the routers
            * *Idea*.
                1. For each OSPF packet that it sends, the router computes the MD5 hash of the content of the OSPF packet appended with the secret key
                2. The router includes the resulting hash value in the OSPF packet
                3. The receiving router, using the preconfigured secret key, computes an MD5 hash of the packet
                4. The receiving router compares the computed hash with the hash value carried within the packet
                5. The receiving router verifies the packet’s authenticity
            * *Sequence numbers*. Used with MD5 authentication to protect against replay attacks
* *Multiple same-cost paths*. When multiple paths to a destination have the same cost, OSPF allows multiple paths to be used
    * *Explain*. A single path need not be chosen for carrying all traffic when multiple equal-cost paths exist
* *Integrated support for unicast and multicast routing*. Multicast OSPF (MOSPF) provides simple extensions to OSPF to provide for multicast routing
    * *Idea*. MOSPF uses the existing OSPF link database and adds a new type of link-state advertisement to the existing OSPF link-state broadcast mechanism
* *Support for hierarchy within a single routing domain*. The ability to structure an AS hierarchically
    
    >**NOTE**. This is the most significant advance in OSPF

    * *Idea*. An OSPF AS can be configured hierarchically into areas
        * *Area*. Each area runs its own OSPF link-state routing algorithm
        * *Routers within an area*. Each router in an area broadcasts its link state to all other routers in that area
            * *Border routers*. Within each area, one or more area border routers route packets outside the area
        * *Backbone area*. One OSPF area in the AS is configured to be the backbone area, which routes traffic between the other areas in the AS
            * *Backbone area's routers*. Always contain all area border routers in the AS and may contain nonborder routers as well
    * *Inter-area routing within the AS*. 
        1. The packet is routed to an area border router, i.e. intra-area routing
        2. The packet is routed through the backbone to the area border router in the destination area
        3. The packet is routed to the final destination

**Setting OSPF link weights**.
* *Previous assumptions*. 
    * Link weights are set
    * a routing algorithm, e.g. OSPF, is run
    * Traffic flows according to the routing tables computed by the LS algorithm
* *Causality between link weights and Dijkstra's algorithm*. 
    * *Theoretical relationship*. the link weights are given, i.e. they come first, and result, i.e. via Dijkstra’s algorithm, in routing paths minimizing overall cost, i.e.
        * Link weights reflect the cost of using a link
        * Disjkstra’s algorithm serves to minimize overall cost
    * *Practical relationship*. The cause and effect relationship between link weights and routing paths may be reversed, i.e. 
        * Network operators configure link weights to obtain routing paths, which achieve certain traffic engineering goals
            * *Examples*. Consider a network operator with an estimate of traffic flow entering the network at each ingress point and destined for each egress point
                
                $\to$ The operator may want to put in place a specific routing of ingress-to-egress flows minimizing the maximum utilization over all of the network’s links
        * *Problem*. With a routing algorithm such as OSPF, the operator’s main knobs for tuning the routing of flows through the network are the link weights

            $\to$ To achieve the goal of minimizing the maximum link utilization, the operator must find the set of link weights achieving this goal
        * *Consequence*. This is a reversal of the cause and effect relationship
            * *Explain*. The desired routing of flows is known, and the OSPF link weights must be found such that the OSPF routing algorithm results in this desired routing of flows

## Inter-AS routing - BGP
**Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) version 4 (BGP4)**. The de facto standard inter-AS routing protocol in today’s Internet
* *BGP as an inter-AS routing protocol*. BGP provides each AS a means to
    * Obtain subnet reachability information from neighboring ASs
    * Propagate the reachability information to all routers internal to the AS
    * Determine “good” routes to subnets based on the reachability information and on AS policy
    * Allow each subnet to advertise its existence to the rest of the Internet
* *Subnet advertisement*. A subnet screams “I exist and I am here” and BGP makes sure that all the ASs in the Internet know about the subnet and how to get there
    
    $\to$ Without BGP, each subnet would be isolated—alone and unknown by the rest of the Internet
* *Reference*. RFC 4271

### BGP basics
**Brief**. BGP is extremely complex, i.e.
* Entire books have been devoted to the subject and many issues are still not well understood
    
    >**NOTE**. Even after having read the books and RFCs
    >f
    >$\to$ It is difficult to fully master BGP without having practiced BGP for many months, if not years, as a designer or administrator of an upper-tier ISP

* Since BGP is an absolutely critical protocol for the Internet—in essence
    
    $\to$ It is the protocol glueing the whole thing together

**Semipermanent TCP connections for exchanging routing information**. In BGP, pairs of routers exchange routing information over semipermanent TCP connections using port 179

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GK1gSi0.png">
    <figcaption>eBGP and iBGP sessions</figcaption>
</div>

* *Network topology*.
    * *Inter-AS connection*. There is typically one semipermanent BGP TCP connection for each link, which directly connects two routers in two different ASs
    * *Intra-AS connection*. There are semipermanent BGP TCP connections between routers within an AS
        
        $\to$ This creates a mesh of TCP connections within each AS
* *BGP peers and sessions*. For each TCP connection
    * *BGP peers*. The two routers at the end of the connection
    * *BGP session*. The TCP connection along with all the BGP messages sent over the connection
        * *External BGP (eBGP) session*. A BGP session spanning two ASs
        * *Internal BGP (iBGP) session*. A BGP session between routers in the same AS

**Routing information in BGP**. BGP allows each AS to learn which destinations are reachable via its neighboring ASs
* *Destinations in BGP*. Not hosts but CIDRized prefixes, with each prefix representing a subnet or a collection of subnets
    * *Example*. 
        * Consider four subnets attached to AS2, i.e. `138.16.64/24`, `138.16.65/24`, `138.16.66/24`, and `138.16.67/24`
            
            $\to$ AS2 could aggregate the prefixes for these subnets, and use BGP to advertise the single prefix to `138.16.64/22` to AS1
        * Consider only the first three of the four subnets in AS2 and the fourth subnet `138.16.67/24` is in AS3
            
            $\to$ AS3 could advertise to AS1 the more specific prefix `138.16.67/24` and AS2 could advertise to AS1 the aggregated prefix `138.16.64/22`
            * *Explain*. Since routers use longest-prefix matching for forwarding datagrams
* *Distribution of prefix reachability information over BGP sessions*.
    * *Distribution among ASes*. 
        1. AS3 sends AS1, i.e. directly connected to AS3, the list of prefixes reachable from AS3
        2. AS1 sends AS3 the list of prefixes reachable from AS1
        3. AS1 and AS2 exchange prefix reachability information
    * *Distribution within an AS*. When a gateway router in any AS receives eBGP-learned prefixes, the gateway router uses its iBGP sessions to distribute the prefixes to the other routers in the AS
        
        $\to$ All the routers in AS1 learn about AS3 prefixes, including the gateway router
        * *Consequence*. The gateway router in AS1 can then re-advertise AS3’s prefixes to AS2
* *Storage of prefix reachability information in routers*. When a router learns about a new prefix, it creates an entry for the prefix in its forwarding table

**Obtaining Internet presence - Putting the puzzle together**.
* *Scenario*. 
    * *Network structure*. Consider a small having a number of servers, including
        * A public Web server describing our company’s products and services
        * A mail server, from which employees obtain their email messages
        * A DNS server
    * *Expectation*. 
        * The entire world should be able to surf the Web site to learn about exciting products and services
        * Employees should be able to send and receive email to potential customers throughout the world
* *Obtaining Internet presence*.
    1. Obtain Internet connectivity, by contracting with, and connecting to, a local ISP
        
        $\to$ The company will have a gateway router, which will be connected to a router in the local ISP
        * *Connection form*. This connection might be
            * A DSL connection through the existing telephone infrastructure, or
            * A leased line to the ISP’s router, or
            * One of the many other access solutions described
    2. The local ISP provides us with an IP address range, e.g. a `/24` address range consisting of 256 addresses
    3. Assign one of the IP addresses in our address range to the Web server, one to the mail server, one to the DNS server, one to the gateway router,

        $\to$ Other IP addresses are assigned to other servers and networking devices in the company’s network
    4. Contract with an Internet registrar to obtain a domain name for the company
    5. Our company must obtain presence in the DNS system
        * *Explain*. Since outsiders want to contact our DNS server to obtain the IP addresses of the servers
            
            $\to$ We need to provide our registrar with the IP address of our DNS server
        * *Consequence*. Our registrar will then put an entry for our DNS server, i.e. domain name and corresponding IP address, in the `.com` top-level-domain servers
    6. Any user knowing our domain name can obtain the IP address of our DNS server via the DNS system
        
        $\to$ People can discover the IP addresses of our Web server
        * *Requirements*. In our DNS server, we need to 
            * Include entries that map the host name of the Web server to its IP address
            * Have similar entries for other publicly available servers in the company, including our mail server
* *Advertisement of the registered Web server*.
    * *Scenario*. When Alice, who knows the IP address of your Web server, sends an IP datagram to that IP address
        
        $\to$ This datagram will be routed through the Internet, visiting a series of routers in many different ASes, and reach our Web server
    * *Problem*. When any router receives the datagram, it is going to look for an entry in its forwarding table to determine on which outgoing port it should forward the datagram
        
        $\to$ Each router must know about the existence of our company’s `/24` prefix
    * *Solution*. The company's prefix becomes aware of it from BGP
        * *Idea*. When our company contracts with a local ISP and gets assigned a prefix
            1. Our local ISP will use BGP to advertise this prefix to the ISPs, to which it connects
            2. Those ISPs will use BGP to propagate the advertisement
            3. Eventually, all Internet routers will know about your prefix
                
                $\to$ The routers can appropriately forward datagrams destined to our Web and mail servers

### Path attributes and BGP routes
**AS number**. In BGP, an AS is identified by its globally unique AS number (ASN), i.e. by RFC 1930
* *Needs for ASN*. Technically, not every AS has an ASN
    * *Explain*. A stub AS, which carries only traffic for which it is a source or destination, will not typically have an ASN
* *Assignment of AS numbers*. ASNs, like IP addresses, are assigned by ICANN regional registries

**BGP attributes**. When a router advertises a prefix across a BGP session, it includes with the prefix a number of BGP attributes
* *Route (in BGP jargon)*. A prefix along with its attributes
    
    $\to$ BGP peers advertise routes to each other
* *Important BGP attributes*.
    * *AS-PATH*. Contain the ASs, through which the advertisement for the prefix has passed
        * *Attribute update*. When a prefix is passed into an AS, the AS adds its ASN to the AS-PATH attribute
        * *Usage*. 
            * Used by routers to detect and prevent looping advertisements
                * *Idea*. If a router sees its AS contained in the path list, it will reject the advertisement
            * Used by routers to choose among multiple paths to the same prefix
    * *NEXT-HOP*. The router interface that begins the AS-PATH
        
        $\to$ This provides the critical link between the inter-AS and intra-AS routing protocols
        * *Idea*. Consider a gateway router A in AS1 advertises a route to gateway router B in AS2 using eBGP
            
            $\to$ A includes the advertised prefix `x`, an AS-PATH to the prefix, and the NEXT-HOP, which is the IP address of A's interface leading to B
            * *Explain*. A router has multiple IP addresses, one for each of its interfaces
        * *NEXT-HOP for configuring router's forwarding table*. Consider another router C in AS2 learning about the A-B route from iBGP
            * *Scenario*. After learning about the route to `x` via A, router C may want to forward packets to `x` along the route
                
                $\to$ Router C may want to include the entry `(x, l)` in its forwarding table, where `l` is its interface, which begins the least-cost path from C towards the gateway router B
            * *Determination of `l`*.
                1. C provides the IP address in the NEXT-HOP attribute to its intra-AS routing module
                2. Intra-AS routing algorithm has previously determined the least-cost path to all subnets attached to the routers in AS2
                    
                    $\to$ This includes to the subnet for the link between B and A
                3. From the least-cost path from C to the B-A subnet, C determines its router interface `l` begining this path
                4. C adds the entry `(x, l)` to its forwarding table
        * *NEXT-HOP for routing*.
            * *Scenario*. AS1 and AS2 are connected by two peering links
                
                $\to$ A router in AS1 could learn about two different routes to the same prefix `x` via AS2
                
                >**NOTE**. These two routes could have the same AS-PATH to `x` but different NEXT-HOP corresponding to the different peering links
                
            * *Consequence*. Using the NEXT-HOP values and the intra-AS routing algorithm, the router can
                * Determine the cost of the path to each peering link, and
                * Apply hot-potato routing to determine the appropriate interface
* *Other attributes*. BGP includes
    * Attributes that allow routers to assign preference metrics to the routes, and
    * An attribute that indicates how the prefix was inserted into BGP at the origin AS

**Router import policy**. 
* *Idea*. When a gateway router receives a route advertisement, it uses its import policy to decide
    * Whether to accept or filter the route, and
    * Whether to set certain attributes, e.g. the router preference metrics
* *Reasons for filtering a route*. The import policy may filter a route since
    * The AS may not want to send traffic over one of the ASs in the route’s AS-PATH, or
    * It knows of a preferable route to the same prefix

### BGP route selection
**Brief**. BGP uses eBGP and iBGP to distribute routes to all the routers within ASs

$\to$ From this distribution, a router may learn about more than one route to any one prefix

**Route selection**. The router must select one of the possible routes
* *Input to selection process*. The set of all routes learned and accepted by the router
* *Route selection algorithm*. If there are two or more routes to the same prefix
    
    $\to$ BGP sequentially invokes the following elimination rules until one route remains
    1. Routes are assigned a local preference value as one of their attributes
       * *Local preference of a route*. Could have been set by the router or could have been learned by another router in the same AS
        
        $\to$ This is a policy decision that is left up to the AS’s network administrator
        * *Idea*. The routes with the highest local preference values are selected
    2. From the remaining routes, i.e. all with the same local preference value
        
        $\to$ The route with the shortest AS-PATH is selected
    3. From the remaining routes, i.e. all with the same local preference value and the same AS-PATH length
        
        $\to$ The route with the closest NEXT-HOP router is selected
        * *"Closest"*. The router, for which the cost of the least-cost path, determined by the intra-AS algorithm, is the smallest
            
            $\to$ This process is called hot-potato routing
    4. If more than one route still remains, the router uses BGP identifiers to select the route

>**NOTE**. The elimination rules are even more complicated than described above

**Putting it all together - How does an entry get into a router's forwarding table**.
* *Routing at router*. When a packet arrives to the router
    1. The packet’s destination IP address is compared with the prefixes in the forwarding table to find the one with the longest prefix match
    2. The packet is forwarded, within the router, to the router port associated with that prefix
* *Insertion of a routing entry into a forwarding table*. Consider a foreign prefix prefix, i.e. it does not belong to the router’s AS but to some other AS
    1. For a prefix to get entered into the router’s forwarding table, the router has to be aware of the prefix, corresponding to a subnet or an aggregation of subnets
        
        $\to$ The router becomes aware of the prefix via a BGP route advertisement
        * *Explain*. Such an advertisement may be sent to the router over 
            * An eBGP session, from a router in another AS, or
            * An iBGP session, from a router in the same AS
    2. The router needs to determine the appropriate output port, to which datagrams destined to that prefix will be forwarded
        * *Idea*. If the router receives more than one route advertisement for the prefix
            
            $\to$ It uses the BGP route selection process to find the best route for the prefix
    3. The selected route includes a NEXT-HOP attribute, which is the IP address of the first router outside the router’s AS along this best route
        
        $\to$ The router uses its intra-AS routing protocol, e.g. OSPF, to determine the shortest path to the NEXT-HOP router
    4. The router determines the port number to associate with the prefix by identifying the first link along that shortest path
    5. The router enters the prefix-port pair into its forwarding table
    6. The forwarding table computed by the routing processor is pushed to the router’s input port line cards

### Routing policy
**Why are there different inter-AS and intra-AS routing protocols**. The answer is at the heart of the differences between the goals of routing within an AS and among ASs
* *Policy*. Among ASs, policy issues dominate
    * *Policy issues*. 
        * Traffic originating in a given AS not be able to pass through another specific AS
        * A given AS must control what transit traffic it carries between other ASs
    * *BGP and policy issues*. BGP carries path attributes and provides for controlled distribution of routing information
        
        $\to$ Policy-based routing decisions can be made
    * *Policy issues within an AS*. Within an AS, everything is nominally under the same administrative control
        
        $\to$ Policy issues play a much less important role in choosing routes within the AS
* *Scale*. The ability of a routing algorithm and its data structures to scale to handle routing to/among large numbers of networks
    
    $\to$ This is a critical issue in inter-AS routing
    * *Scalability within an AS*. Within an AS, scalability is less of a concern
        * *Explain*. If a single administrative domain becomes too large
            
            $\to$ We can divide it into two ASs and perform inter-AS routing between the two new ASs
* *Performance*. Since inter-AS routing is policy-oriented, the quality, e.g. performance, of the routes used is a concern
    * *Explain*. A longer or more costly route, which satisfies certain policy criteria, may well be taken over a route, which is shorter but does not meet that criteria
        
        >**NOTE**. Among ASs, there is not even the notion of cost, other than AS hop count, associated with routes
    
    * *Performance issues within an AS*. Within an AS, such policy concerns are of less importance
        
        $\to$ This allows routing to focus more on the level of performance realized on a route
