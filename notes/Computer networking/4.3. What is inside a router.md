# What is inside a router
**Forwarding function of the network layer**. The actual transfer of packets from a router's incoming links to the appropriate outgoing links at that router

>**NOTE**. "Forwarding" and "switching" are often used interchangeably by computer-networking researchers and practitioners

**A generic router architecture**. Consist of four components

    <figcaption>Router architecture</figcaption>
</div>

* *Input ports*.
    * *Key functions*.
        * Perform the physical layer function of terminating an incoming physical link at a router

            $\to$ This is the leftmost box of the input port, and the rightmost box of the output port
        * Perform link-layer functions required to interoperate with the link layer at the other side of the incoming link

            $\to$ This is the middle boxes in the input and output ports
        * (Perhaps) perform the lookup function, i.e. the most crucial function

            $\to$ This is the rightmost box of the input port
            * *Idea*. Consult the forwarding table to determine the router output port, to which an arriving packet will be forwarded via the switching fabric
                * *Explain*. Control packets, e.g. packets carrying routing protocol information, are forwarded from an input port to the routing processor
    * *Port*. Refer to the physical input and output router interfaces
        
        $\to$ This is distinctly different from the software ports associated with network applications and sockets
* *Switching fabric*. Connect the router's input ports to its output ports

    $\to$ This is completely contained within the router, i.e. a network inside of a network router
* *Output ports*. Store packets recevied from the switching fabric and transmits these packets on the outgoing link by performing the necessary link-layer and physical-layer functions
    * *Bidirectional links*. When a link is bidirectional, an output port will typically be paired with the input port for that link on the same line card
    * *Line card*. A printed circuit board containing one or more input ports, which is connected to the switching fabric
* *Routing processor*. Execute the routing protocols, maintain routing tables and attached link state information, and computes the forwarding table for the router

    >**NOTE**. This processor also performs network management functions

**Implementation of forwarding function**. A router's input ports, output ports, and switching fabric together implement the forwading function, and are almost always implemented in hardware
* *Router forwarding plane*. The forwarding functions provided by router's input ports, output ports, and switching fabric
    * *Hardware implementation requirement*. Hardware implementation is required for performance perposes
        * *Explain*. If $N$ ports are combined on a line card, as is often done in practice

            $\to$ The datagram-processing pipeline must operate $N$ times faster, which is far too fast for software implementation
    * *Runtime scale*. In the order of nanoseconds
* *Router control plane*. Include executing the routing protocols, responding to attached links which go up or down, and performing management functions
    * *Software implementation requirement*. Router control plane functions are usually implemented in software and execute on the routing processor, which is typically a traditional CPU
    * *Runtme scale*. In the order of milliseconds or seconds

**Analogy of router functionality**. Let suppose that the car interchange is a roundabout, i.e. before a car enters the roundabout, a bit of processing is required
* *Processing step*. 
    1. The car stops at an entry station and indicates its final destination, i.e. not the local roundabout, but the ultimate destionation of its journey
    2. An attendant at the entry station looks up the final destination, determines the roundabout exit leading to the desired destination
    3. The attendant tells the driver which roundabout exit to take
    4. The car enters the roundabout, which may be filled with other cars entering from other input roads and heading to other roundabout exits
    5. The car eventually leaves at the prescribed roundabout exit ramp, where it may encounter other cars leaving the roundabout at that exit
* *Analogy to router components*.
    * *Input ports*. Correspond to the entry road and entry station, with a lookup function to determine to local outgoing port
    * *Switch fabric*. Correspond to the roundabout
    * *Output ports*. Correspond to the roundabout exit roads
* *Possible bottlenecks*. 
    * If cars arrive blazingly fast but the station attendant is slow, then bottleneck occurs
        
        $\to$ How fast must the attendant work to ensure there is no backup on an entry road
    * Even with a blazingly fast attendant, if cars traverse the roundabout slowly, can backups still occur?
    * If most of the entering cars all want to leave the roundabout at the same exit ramp

        $\to$ Can backups occur at the exit ramp or elsewhere?
    * How should the roundabout operate if we want to assign priorities to different cars, or block certain cars from entering the roundabout in the first place?

## Input processing
**Main steps**. Line termination function, link-layer processing, and lookup function

>**NOTE**. The lookup performed in the input port is central to the router's operation
>$\to$ The router uses the forwarding table to look up the output port, to which an arriving packet will be forwarded via the switching fabric

<div style="text-align:center">

    <figcaption>Input port processing</figcaption>
</div>

**Forwading table**. Computed and updated by the routing processor, with a shadow copy typically stored at each input port
* *Forwading table copying*. The forwading table is copied from the routing processor to the line cards over a separate bus, e.g. a PCI bus
* *Consequence*. With a shadow copy, forwarding decisions can be made locally, at each input port, without invoking the centralized routing processor on a per-packet basis

    $\to$ This avoids a centralized processing bottleneck

**Lookup function**. Simply search through the forwarding table looking for the longest prefix match
* *Lookup algorithm*. At Gigabit transmission rates, this lookup must be performed in nanoseconds

    $\to$ Not only must lookup be performed in hardware, but techniques beyond a simple linear search through a large table are needed
* *Memory access time*. Special attention must be paid to memory access times, resulting in designs with embedded on-chip DRAM and faster SRAM, i.e. used as a DRAM cache, memories
    * *Ternary content address memories (TCAMs)*. Often used for lookup
        * *Idea*. A 32-bit IP address is presented to the memory, which returns the content of the forwarding table entry for that address in essentially constant time
    * *Typical memory size*. The Cisco 8500 has 64K CAM for each input port

**Forwading packets to switching fabric**. Once a packet's output port has been determined via the lookup, the packet can be sent into the switching fabric
* *Packet blocking*. In some design, a packet may be temporarily blocked from entering the switching fabric if packets from other input ports are currently using the fabric

    $\to$ A blocked packet will be queued at the input port and then scheduled to cross the fabric at a later point of time

**Other actions by inpurt ports**.
* Physical- and link-layer processing must occur
* The packet's version number, checksum, and time-to-live field must be checked and the latter two fields rewritten
* Counters used for network management, e.g. the number of IP datagrams received, must be updated

**Match plus action abstraction in networked devices (not just routers)**. The input port steps of looking up an IP address, i.e. match, then sending the packet into the switching fabric, i.e. action, is a specific case of "match plus action" abstraction
* *Other examples*.
    * *Link-layer switches*. Link-layer destination addresses are looked up and several actions may be taken, additional to sending the frame into the switching fabric towards the output port
    * *Firewalls*. Devices which filter out selected incoming packets, i.e. packets whose header matches a given criteria, e.g. a combination of source - destination IP addresses and transport-layer port numbers, may be prevented from being forwarded (action)
    * *Network address translator (NAT)*. An incoming packet, whose transport-layer port number matches a given value, will have its port number rewritten before forwarding (action)

## Switching
**The switching fabric**. The very heart of a router, i.e. through this fabric that packets are actually switched, i.e. forwarded, from an input port to an output port

**Switching methods**.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/R6zGShd.png">
    <figcaption>Switching techniques</figcaption>
</div>

* *Switching via memory*. The simplest method, used in earliest routers, which were traditional computers
    * *Idea*. Switching between input and output ports is done under direct control of the CPU, i.e. routing processor

        $\to$ Input and output ports functioned as a traditional I/O devices in a traditional OS
    * *Data flow*.
        1. An input port with an arriving packet first signaled the routing processor via an interrupt
        2. The packet was then copied from the input port into processor memory
        3. The routing processor then extracted the destination address from the header
        4. The routing processor looks up the appropriate output port in the forwading table
        5. The routing processor copies the packet to the output port's buffers
    * *Drawback*. 
        * If the memory bandwidth is $B$ packets per second, i.e. can be written into or read from memory

            $\to$ The overall forwading throughput must be less than $B/2$
        * Two packets cannot be forwarded at the same time, even if they have different destination ports
            * *Explain*. Only one memory read and write over the shared system bus can be done at a time
    * *Usage*. In many modern routers, with the destination address lookup and the storing of packet into the appropriate memory location are performed by processing on the input line cards
    * *Analogy to shared-memory processors*. Routers switching via memory look very much like shared-memory multiprocessor
* *Switching via a bus*. An input port transfers a packet directly to the output port over a shared bus, without intervention by the routing processor
    * *Implementation*.
        1. Have the input port prepend a switch-internal label (header) to the packet indicating the local output port, to which this packet is being transferred
            
            $\to$ The input port then transmits the packet onto the bus
        2. The packet is recevied by all output ports, but only the port matching the label will keep the packet
        3. The label is then removed at the output port
    * *Multiple-packet implementation*. If multiple packets arrive to the router at the same time, each at a different input port

        $\to$ All but one must wait, since only one packet can cross the bus at a time
        * *Consequence*. The switching speed of the router is limited to the bus speed
    * *Usage*. Sufficient for routers operating in a small local area and enterprise networks
* *Switching via an interconnection network*. One way to overcome the bandwidth limitation of a single, shared bus
    * *Idea*. Use a more sophisticated interconnection network, e.g. those used in the past to interconnect processors in a multiprocessor computer architecture
        * *Example*. Use a crossbar switch, with $2N$ buses connecting $N$ input ports to $N$ output ports
    * *Data flow*.
        1. A packet arrives from port A and needs to be forwarded to port Y
        2. The switch controller closes the crosspoint at the intersection of busses A and Y
        3. Port A then sends the packet onto its bus, which is picked up only by bus Y
        4. Meanwhile a packet from port B can be forwarded to port X at the same time

            $\to$ Since A-to-Y and B-to-X packets use different input and output busses

## Output processing
**Output port processing**. Take packets stored in the output port's memory and transmit them over the output link

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NOP9moy.png">
    <figcaption>Output port processing</figcaption>
</div>

* *Processing steps*. Include 
    * Selecting and dequeuing packets for transmission
    * Performing the required link-layer and physical-layer transmission functions

## Where does the queuing occur
**Packet queues**. Required at both the input ports and the output ports
* *Location and extent of queueing*. Depend on the traffic load, the relative speed of the switching fabric, and the line speed
* *Packet loss*. As the queues grow large, the router's memory can eventually be exhausted and packet loss will occur when no memory is available to store arriving packets

    $\to$ Packets are dropped at the router

**Packet drop analysis**.
* *Switching fabric transfer rate*. The rate, at which packets can be moved from input port to output port
* *Assumptions*.
    * The input and output line speeds, i.e. transmission rates, are the same and equal to $R_\text{line}$
    * There are $N$ input ports and $N$ output ports
    * All packets have the same fixed length, and the packets arrive to input ports in a synchronous manner
        * *Synchronous input*. 
            * The time to send a packet on any link equals the time to receive a packet on any link
            * During the sending / receiving time, either zero or one packet can arrive on an input link
    * Switching fabric transfer rate is $R_\text{switch}$
* *Observations*. If $R_\text{switch} \geq N R_\text{line}$, then 
    * Only negligible queuing will occur at the input ports
    * The number of queued packets can grow large enough to exhaust available memory at the output ports

        $\to$ Packets are dropped

**Router ruffer size**. Router buffers are required to absorb the fluctuations in traffic load, but how much buffering is required?
* *Rule of thumb for many years*. The amount of buffering $B$ should be equal to an average round-trip time $\text{RTT}$ times the link capacity $C$
    * *Usage*. When the number $N$ of TCP flows is relatively small
* *Buffer size for large number of TCP flows*. $B=\text{RTT} \cdot C / \sqrt{N}$

**Packet scheduler at the output port**. Choose one packet among those queued for transmission
* *Common algorithms*. FCFS (first-come-first-served), WFQ (weighted fair queuing)
    * *WFQ*. Share the outgoing link fairly among the different end-to-end connections having packets queued for transmission
* *Quality-of-service guarantees*. Packet scheduling plays a crucial role in providing quality-of-service guarantees

**Packet drop policy**. If there is not enough memory to buffer an incoming packet, a decision must be made to drop some packet
* *Dropping policy*.
    * *Drop-tail*. Drop the arriving packet
    * *Drop-body or drop-head*. Remove one or more already-queued packets to make room for the newly arrived ones
        * *Congestion signal*. In some cases, it may be good to drop, or mark the header of, a packet before the buffer is full, to provide a congestion signal to the sender
* *Active queue management (AQM) algorithms*. A set of a number of packet-dropping and -marking policies
    * *The most widely used algorithm*. Random early detection (RED) algorithm
    * *Idea of RED*. A weighted average is maintained for the length of the output queue
        * If the average queue length is less than a threshold $\min_\text{th}$
            
            $\to$ When a packet arrives, it is admitted to the queue
        * If the queue is full, or the average queue length is greater than a threshold $\max_\text{th}$

            $\to$ When a packet arrives, it will be marked or dropped
        * If the packet arrives to find an average queue length in the interval $[\min_\text{th},\max_\text{th}]$
            
            $\to$ The packet is marked or dropped with a probability, which is typically some function of the average queue length, $\min_\text{th}$, and $\max_\text{th}$

**Input queue**. If the switch fabric is not fast enough, relative to the input line speeds, then packet queuing can also occur at the input ports

$\to$ Packets must join input port queues to wait their turn to be transferred through the switching fabric to the output port
* *Head-of-the-line blocking*. When the first packet in the input queue of some input port must wait for other packets from other input ports for queueing

    $\to$ The input queue will grow to unbounded length under certain assumptions

## The rounting control plane
**Routing control plane location**. The routing control plane resides and executes in a routing processor within the router

$\to$ The network-wide routing control plane is thus decentralized, with different pieces, e.g. of routing algorithm, executing at different routers
* *Router interaction*. Different routers interact by sending control messages to each other

**Data plane and software control plane**. Bundled by router and switch vendors into closed, but inter-operable, platforms in a vertically integrated product
