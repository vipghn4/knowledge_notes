# Error-detection and -correction techniques
**Bit-level error detection and correction**. Detecting and correcting the corruption of bits in a link-layer frame sent from one node to another physically connected neighboring node

$\to$ These are two services often provided by the link layer

>**NOTE**. Error-detection and -correction services are also often offered at the transport layer as well

**Error-detection and correction**.
* *Scenario*.

    </div>

    1. At the sending node, data $D$ to be protected against bit errors is augmented with error-detection and -correction bits $\text{EDC}$
        * *Data to be protected*. Typically include 
            * The datagram passed down from the network layer for transmission across the link, and
            * Link-level addressing information, sequence numbers, and other fields in the link frame header
    2. Both $D$ and $\text{EDC}$ are sent to the receiving node in a link-level frame
    3. At the receiving node, a sequence of bits $D'$ and $\text{EDC}'$ is received
        
        $\to$ $D'$ and $\text{EDC}'$ may differ from $D$ and $\text{EDC}$ as a result of in-transit bit flips
    4. The receiver’s challenge is to determine whether or not $D'$ is the same as $D$, given that it has only received $D'$ and $\text{EDC}'$
* *Localization of bit error*. Error-detection and -correction techniques allow the receiver to sometimes, but not always, detect that bit errors have occurred
* *Imperfection of error detection*. Even with the use of error-detection bits
    
    $\to$ There still may be undetected bit errors, i.e. the receiver may be unaware that the received information contains bit errors
    * *Consequence*. The receiver might deliver a corrupted datagram to the network layer, or be unaware that the contents of a field in the frame’s header has been corrupted
        
        $\to$ We desire an error-detection scheme, which keeps the probability of such occurrences small 
* *Accuracy and speed trade-off*. More sophisticated error-detection and-correction techniques incur a larger overhead
    * *Explain*. More computation is needed to compute and transmit a larger number of error-detection and -correction bits

## Parity checks
**Parity checks**. The simplest form of error detection is the use of a single parity bit
* *Scenario*. Consider a message $D$ of $d$ bits
* *Even parity schemes*. The sender includes one additional bit and chooses its value such there is an even number of $1$s
* *Odd parity schemes*. The parity bit value is chosen such that there is an odd number of $1$s

**Undetected error**. Consider an even parity scheme, if an even number of bit errors occur

$\to$ This implies an undetected error, rather than no error
* *Probability of error in ideal scenario*. 
    * *Condition*. The probability of multiple bit errors in a packet would be extremely small if
        * The probability of bit errors is small, and
        * Errors can be assumed to occur independently from one bit to the next
    * *Consequence*. A single parity bit might suffice
* *Probability of error in practical scenario*. Errors are often clustered together in bursts
    * *Burst error conditions*. Under these conditions, the probability of undetected errors in a frame protected by single-bit parity can approach 50 percent
    * *Consequence*. A more robust error-detection scheme is needed

**Two-dimensional parity**. A simple generalization of one-bit parity, which provides insight into error-correction techniques

    <figcaption>Two-dimensional even parity</figcaption>
</div>

* *Idea*.
    1. The $d$ bits in $D$ are divided into $i$ rows and $j$ columns
    2. A parity value is computed for each row and for each column
        
        $\to$ This results in $i + j + 1$ parity bits comprising the link-layer frame’s error-detection bits
* *Error detection*. If a bit error occurs in the $d$ bits of information
    
    $\to$ The parity of both the column and the row containing the flipped bit will be in error
    * *Consequence*. 
        * The receiver can detect that a bit error has occurred
        * The receiver can use the column and row indices of the column and row with parity errors to identify the corrupted bit
            
            $\to$ The receiver can correct ther error
* *Detection of multiple errors*. Two-dimensional parity can detect, but not correct, any combination of two errors in a packet

**Forward error correction (FEC)**. The ability of the receiver to both detect and correct errors
* *Usage*. Commonly used in audio storage and playback devices, e.g. audio CDs
* *Combination with other techniques*. In a network setting, FEC techniques can be used by themselves, or in conjunction with link-layer ARQ
* *Importance of FEC*. FEC techniques are valuable since
    * They can decrease the number of sender retransmissions required
    * They allow for immediate correction of errors at the receiver
        
        $\to$ This avoids having to wait for
        * The round-trip propagation delay needed for the sender to receive a NAK packet, and
        * The retransmitted packet to propagate back to the receiver
        
    >**NOTE**. This is a potentially important advantage for real-time network applications, or links with long propagation delays

## Checksumming methods
**Checksumming methods**. The $d$ bits of data are treated as a sequence of $k$-bit integers
* *Simple checksumming method*. Sum the $k$-bit integers and use the resulting sum as the error-detection bits
* *Pros and cons*.
    * *Pros*. Checksumming methods require relatively little packet overhead
        * *Example*. The checksums in TCP and UDP use only 16 bits
    * *Cons*. Checksumming methods provide relatively weak protection against errors as compared with cyclic redundancy check

**Internet checksum**. Given in RFC 1071
* *Idea*. 
    1. Bytes of data are treated as 16-bit integers and summed
    
        $\to$ The $1$s complement of this sum is used as the Internet checksum
    2. The checksum is carried in the segment header
    3. The receiver checks the checksum by taking the $1$s complement of the sum of the received data, including the checksum
    4. The receiver checks whether the result is all $1$ bits
    5. If any of the bits are $0$, an error is indicated
* *Internet checksum in TCP and UDP protocols*. The checksum is computed over all fields, i.e. header and data fields included
* *Internet checksum in IP*. The checksum is computed over the IP header, i.e. since the UDP or TCP segment has its own checksum
* *Internet checksum in other protocols*. One checksum is computed over the header and another checksum is computed over the entire packet

**Checksumming at transport layer**. Checksumming is used at the transport layer and cyclic redundancy check is used at the link layer
* *Transport layer*. Typically implemented in software in a host as part of the host’s OS
    * *Consequence*. Since transport-layer error detection is implemented in software
        
        $\to$ It is important to have a simple and fast error-detection scheme like checksumming. On the other hand, error detection at
* *Link layer*. Implemented in dedicated hardware in adapters, which can rapidly perform the more complex CRC operations

## Cycle redundancy check (CRC)
**Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes**. An error-detection technique used widely in today’s computer networks
* *Other name*. Polynomial codes, i.e.
    * It is possible to view the bit string to be sent as a polynomial, where coefficients are the 0 and 1 values in the bit string
    * Operations on the bit string interpreted as polynomial arithmetic
* *Idea*. Consider the $d$-bit piece of data $D$, that the sending node wants to send to the receiving node
    1. The sender and receiver agree on an $r + 1$ bit pattern, i.e. a generator, $G$
        * *Requirements on $G$*. The most significant, i.e. leftmost, bit of $G$ is 1
    2. For a given piece of data $D$, the sender chooses $r$ additional bits $R$
    3. The sender appends them to $D$, resulting in a $d + r$ bit pattern, which is exactly divisible by $G$ using modulo-2 arithmetic
    4. The receiver divides the $d + r$ received bits by $G$
    5. If the remainder is nonzero, the receiver knows that an error has occurred
        
        $\to$ Otherwise the data is accepted as being correct
* *CRC calculations*. All CRC calculations are done in modulo-2 arithmetic without carries in addition or borrows in subtraction, i.e.
    * *Addition and subtraction*. These are identical, and are equivalent to the bitwise exclusive-or (XOR) of the operands
        * *Examples*. `1011 XOR 0101 = 1011 - 0101 = 1110` or `1001 XOR 1101 = 1001 - 1101 = 0100`
    * *Multiplication and division*. The same as in base-2 arithmetic, except that any required addition or subtraction is done without carries or borrows
        * *Multiplication by $2^k$*. Left shift a bit pattern by $k$ places

            $\to$ `D x 2^r XOR R` results in $d+r$ bit pattern

**Selection and computation of paramters**.
* *Computation of $R$*.
    * *Objective*. Find $R$ so that

        $$D\cdot 2^r \text{XOR} R = n G$$

        for some integer $n$
    * *Idea*. We have that

        $$D\cdot 2^r = nG\text{XOR} R$$

        hence $R$ can be calculated as

        $$R=\text{remainder} \frac{D\cdot 2^r}{G}$$
* *Selection of generator $G$*. International standards have been defined for 8-, 12-, 16-, and 32-bit generators $G$
    * *CRC-32*. 32-bit standard adopted in a number of link-layer IEEE protocols

        $$G_\text{CRC-32}=100000100110000010001110110110111$$

**Robustness of CRC**. 
* Each of the CRC standards can detect burst errors of fewer than $r+1$ bits

    $\to$ All consecutive errors of $r$ bits or fewer can be detected
* Under appropriate assumptions, a burst of length greater than $r + 1$ bits is detected with probability $1 – 0.5^r$
* Each of the CRC standards can detect any odd number of bit
errors
