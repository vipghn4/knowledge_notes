# Protocols for real-time conversational applications
## RTP
**Motivation**. Since most multimedia networking applications can make use of sequence numbers and timestamps

$\to$ It is convenient to have a standardized packet structure including fields for audio and video data, sequence number, and timestamp, and other potentially useful fields

**RTP**. A standard used for transporting common formats such as PCM, ACC, and MP3 for sound, and MPEG and H263 for video
* *Reference documentation*. RFC 3550

### RTP basics
**Transport-layer protocol**. RTP typically runs on top of UDP
* *Idea of execution*.
    1. The sending side encapsulates a media chunk within an RTP packet, then encapsulates the packet in a UDP segment
    2. The sending side then hands the segment to IP
    3. The receiving side extracts the RTP packet from the UDP segment, then extracts the media chunk from the RTP packet
    4. The receiving side then passes the chunk to the media player for decoding and rendering

**RTP packet**. The audio / video chunk with the RTP header form the RTP packet
* *RTP header*. The sending side precedes each chunk of the audio or video data with an RTP header
    * *Head structure*.
        * The type of audio / video encoding
        * A sequence number
        * A timestamp
    * *Header length*. Normally 12 b ytes
    * *Usage*. Used by the receiving application to properly deccode and play back the audio / video

**RTP provided services**.
* *Incorporation with other networked multimedia applications*. If an application incorporates RTP, instead of a proprietary scheme to provide payload type, sequence numbers, or timestamps

    $\to$ The application will more easily interoperate with other networked multimedia applications
* *Guaranteed delivery and QoS*. RTP does not provide any mechanism to ensure timely delivery of data, or provide other QoS guarantees

    $\to$ It does not even guarantee delivery of packets, or prevent out-of-order delivery of packets
* *RTP is an application-layer protocol*. RTP encapsulation is seen only at the end systems

    $\to$ Routers do not distinguish between IP datagrams carrying RTP packets and other IP datagrams

**RTP stream assigment**. RTP allows each source, e.g. a camera or a microphone, to be assigned its own independent RTP stream of packets
* *Example*. For a video conference between a two participants, four RTP streams could be opened, i.e.
    * Two streams for transmitting the audio, one in each direction
    * Two streams for transmitting video, one in each direction
* *Single-stream video  conference*. Many popular encoding techniques, e.g. MPEG 1 and MPEG 2, bundle the audio and video into a single stream during the encoding process

$\to$ Only one RTP stream is generated in each direction

**Multicasting stream**. RTP packets are not limited to unicast applications

$\to$ They can also be sent over one-to-many or many-to-many multicast trees
* *Many-to-many multicast sessions*. All of the session's senders and sources typically use the same multicast group for sending their RTP streams
* *RTP session*. RTP multicast streams belonging together, e.g. audio and video streams emanating from multiple senders in a video conference application

### RTP packet header 
**Supported audio and video payload types of RTP**.

    <figcaption>Some video payload types supported by RTP</figcaption>
</div>

**Main RTP packet header fields**. Payload type, sequence number, timestamp, and source ID fields
* *Payload type field*. 
    * *For audio stream*. The payload type field is used to indicate the type of audio encoding, e.g. PCM, adaptive delta modulation, linear predictive coding, etc.
        * *Changing encoding type*. If a sender decides to change the encoding in the middle of a session

            $\to$ It can inform the receiver of the change through this payload type field
            * *Example*. The sender may want to change the encoding to increase the audio quality, or to decrease the RTP stream bit rate
    * *For video stream*. The payload type is used to indicate the type of video coding, e.g. JPEG, MPEG 1, MPEG 2, or H.261, etc.

        $\to$ The sender can change video encoding on the fly during a session
    * *Length*. 7 bits
* *Sequence number field*. Incremented by one for each RTP packet sent, and may be used by the receiver to detect packet loss and to restore packet sequence
    * *Length*. 16 bits
* *Timestamp field*. Reflect the sampling instant of the first byte in the RTP data packet

    $\to$ The receiver can use timestamps to remove packet jitter introduced in the network, and provide synchronous playout at the receiver
    * *Reference timestamp*. The timestamp is delivered fro a sampling clock at the sender
    * *Length*. 32 bits
* *Synchronization source ID (SSRC)*. Identify the source of the RTP stream
    * *Explain*. Each stream in an RTP session typically has a distinct SSRC

        >**NOTE**. The SSRC is not the IP address of the sender, but a number which the source assigns randomly when the new stream is started

        >**NOTE**. The probability that two streams get assigned the same SSRC is very small
        >$\to$ If this happen, the two sources pick a new SSRC value

    * *Length*. 32 bits

## SIP
**Session initiation protocol (SIP)**. An open and lightweight protocol
* *Functionality*.
    * Provide mechanism for establishing calls between a caller and a callee over an IP network, i.e.
        * It allows the caller to notify the callee that it wants to start a call
        * It allows the participants to agree on media encodings
        * It allows participants to end calls
    * Provide mechanisms for the caller to determine the current IP address of the callee
        * *Explain*. Users do not have a single, fixed IP address, since
            * They may be assigned addresses dynamically, using DHCP
            * They may have multiple IP devices, each with a different IP address
    * Provide mechanisms for call management, e.g.
        * Add new media streams during the call
        * Change the encoding during the call
        * Invite new participants during the call
        * Call transfer, and call holding

### Setting up a call to a known IP address
**Simple scenario**. Alice is at her PC wanting to call Bob, who is also working at his PC

$\to$ Alice's and Bob's PCs are both equipped with SIP-based software for making and receiving phone calls

>**NOTE**. We assume that Alice knows the IP address of Bob's PC in this example

* *SIP call establishment*.

        <figcaption>SIP call establishment when Alice knows Bob's IP address</figcaption>
    </div>

    1. An SIP session begins when Alice sends Bob an INVITE message, which resembles an HTTP requeset message

        >**NOTE**. SIP messages can also be sent over TCP

        * *INVITE message*. Sent over UDP to the well-known port 5060 for SIP
            * *Message structure*. Include 
                * An ID for Bob, e.g.`bob@193.64.210.89`
                * An ID of Alice's current IP address
                * An indication that Alice desires to receive audio / video encoded in a specific format, and encapsulated in some format, e.g. RTP
                * An indication that Alice wants to receive the RTP packets on port 38060
    2. After receiving Alice's INVITE message, Bob sends an SIP response message resembling an HTTP response message
        
        $\to$ This SIP response message is sent to the SIP port 5060
        * *Message structure*. Include
            * A 200 OK code
            * An indication of Bob's IP address
            * Bob's desired encoding and packetization for reception
            * Bob's port number, to which the audio / video packets should be sent
        
        >**NOTE**. Alice and Bob may use different audio / video encoing mechanisms

        * *Not-available encoding scheme error*. If Bob does not have Alice's desired codec for encoding audio / video
            1. Bob responds with a `600 Not Acceptable` and list in the message all codecs he can use
            2. Alice then chooses one of the listed codecs and send another INVITE message, this time advertising the chosen codec
        * *Call rejection*. Bob can reject the call by sending one of many possible rejection reply codes, e.g. busy, gone, etc.
    3. After receiving Bob's response, Alice sends Bob an SIP acknowledgement message
    4. After this SIP transaction, Bob and Alice can talk
* *SIP call procedure*.
    * Bob encodes and packetizes the audio / video as requested and sent to the packets to Alice's desired port number at her IP address
    * Alice encodes and packetizes the audio / video as requested and sent to the packets to Bob's desired port number at her IP address

**SIP is an out-of-band protocol**. Like FTP, SIP is an out-of-band protocol
* The SIP messages are sent and received in sockets which are different from those used for sending and receiving media data
* The SIP messages are ASCII-reable, and resemble HTTP messages
* SIP requires all messages to be acknowledged, so it can run over UDP or TCP

### SIP addresses
**SIP addresses and e-mail addresses**. We expect many, if not most, SIP addresses to resemble e-mail addresses, e.g. `sip:bob@domain.com`

    $\to$ When Alice's SIP device sends an INVITE message, the message would includ this e-mail-like address
* *Other possible forms for the SIP address*. Bob's legacy phone number, or Bob's first / middle / last name

**SIP addresses included in Web page**. SIP addresses can be included in Web pages, just as people's e-mail addresses are included in Web pages with the mailto URL

### SIP messages

>**NOTE**. We will not cover all SIP message types and headers in this short session
>$\to$ We will take a brief look at the SIP INVITE message and a few common header lines

**SIP INVITE message**. Assume that Alice wants to initiates a VoIP call to Bob and she knows only Bob's SIP address, i.e. `bob@domain.com`, without knowing his IP address
* *INVITE message format*.

    ```yaml
    INVITE sip:bob@domain.com SIP/2.0
    Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 167.180.112.24
    From: sip:alice@hereway.com
    To: sip:bob@domain.com
    Call-ID: a2e3a@pigeon.hereway.com
    Content-Type: application/sdp
    Content-Length: 885

    c=IN IP4 167.180.112.24
    m=audio 38060 RTP/AVP 0
    ```

    * *SIP version*. Like version number in an HTTP request message
    * *Via header*. Whenever an SIP message passes through an SIP device, it attaches a Via header

        $\to$ This indicates the IP address of the device
    * *From and To header*. Similar to an e-mail message
    * *Call-ID*. Uniquely identify the call, i.e. similar to message-ID in e-mail
    * *Content-Type header line*. Define the format used to describe the content contained in the SIP message
    * *Content-Length header line*. Provide the length in bytes of the content in the message
    * *Message content*. AFter a carriage return and line feed, the message contains the content

        $\to$ In this case, the content provides information about Alice's IP address and how she wants to receive the audio

### Name translation and user location
**Problem**. Alice's SIP device may not know the IP address where Bob could be contacted, she knows only Bob's e-mail address

$\to$ Alice needs to obtain the IP address of the device that Bob is currently using via his email
* *Idea*. 
    1. Alice creates an INVITE message begining with `INVITE bob@doamin.com SIP/2.0`

        $\to$ Alice then sends this message to an SIP proxy
    2. The proxy will respond with an SIP reply including the IP address of the device used by `bob@domain.com`

        $\to$ Otherwise, the proxy may reply with the IP address of Bob's voicemail box, or a URL of a Web page saying "Bob is not available"

**How SIP proxy determines the current IP address for `bob@domain.com`**. 
* *SIP registrar*. A SIP device, where every SIP user has an associated one
* *Registrar registering procedure*.
    1. When a user launches an SIP application on a device, the application sends an SIP register message to the registrar
        
        $\to$ Informing the registrar of its current IP address
       * *Example message to SIP registrar*.

           ```yaml
           REGISTER sip:domain.com SIP/2.0
           Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 193.64.210.89
           From: sip:bob@domain.com
           To: sip:bob@domain.com
           Expires: 3600
           ```
    2. Bob's registrar keeps track of Bob's current IP address
        * Whenever Bob switches to a new SIP device, the new device sends a new register message, indicating the new IP address
        * If Bob remains at the same device for an extended period of time

            $\to$ The device will send refresh register messages, indicating that the most recently sent IP address is still valid
* *SIP registrar location*. Often on the same host as SIP proxies
* *Consequence*. The SIP registrar translates fixed human IDs to dynamic IP addresses

    $\to$ The SIP registrar is similar to a DNS authoritative name server

**How Alice's SIP proxy server obtains Bob's current IP address**. 
1. The Alice's proxy server needs to forward Alice's INVITE message to Bob's registrar / proxy
2. The registrar / proxy then forward the message to Bob's current SIP device
3. Bob, having now received Alice's INVITE message, could send an SIP response to Alice

**Other usages of SIP**. SIP, beign a signaling protocol for initiating and ending calls in general, can be used for video conference calls, and text-based sessions

>**NOTE**. SIP has become a fundamental component in many instant messaging applications
