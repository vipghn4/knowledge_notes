# Routing algorithms
**Rounting in network layer**. 
* *Datagram service and VC service*.
    * *Datagram service*. Different packets between a given source-destination pair may take different routes
    * *VC service*. All packets between a given source and destination will take the same path
* *Routing in network layer*. Whether the network layer provides a datagram service or a VC service

    $\to$ It must determine the path, which the packets take from senders to receivers
* *Problem of routing a packet from source host to destination host*. Equivalent to the problem of routing the packet from source router to destination router
    * *Default router*. A host is typically attached directly to one router, i.e. the default router for the host
        * *Other name*. First-hop router
    * *Source router*. The default fouter of the source host
    * *Destination router*. The default router of the destination host

**Routing algorithm**. The purpose of a routing algorithm is, given a set of routers, with links connecting the routers, finds a good path from source router to destination router
* *Goodness of path*. A good path is typically one having the least cost

    >**NOTE**. In practice, real-world concerns such as policy issues also come into play to complicate the conceptually simple and elegant algorithms, whose theory underlies the practice of routing in today's networks

**Routing problem formulation**. A graph is used to formulate routing problems, where each edge between two router vertices has a cost value
* *Graphical representation of networks*.
    * *Edge's cost*. Typically reflect the physical length of the corresponding link, the link speed, or the monetary cost associated with a link

        $$E(x,y)=\begin{cases}
        c(x,y) & x,y \text{ are connected}\\
        \infty & x,y \text{ are not connected}
        \end{cases}$$

**Types of algorithms to find least-cost path (or shortest path)**.
* *Classification by inputs*.
    * *Global routing algorithm*. Compute the least-cost path between a source and a destination using complete, global knowledge about the network
        * *Idea*.
            1. Take the connectivity between all nodes and all link costs as inputs

                $\to$ This requires that the algorithm somehow obtain this information before actually performing the calculation
            2. The calculation is run at one site, i.e. a centralized global routing algorithm, or replicated at multiple sites
        * *Link-state (LS) algorithms*. In practice, algorithms with global state information are often referred to as link-state algorithms
            * *Explain*. The algorithm must be aware of the cost of each link in the network
    * *Decentralized routing algorithm*. The calculation of the least-cost path is carried out in an iterative, distributed manner
        * *Constraint*. No node has complete information about the costs of all network links

            $\to$ Each node begins with only the knowledge of the costs of its own directly attached links
        * *Idea*. Through an iterative process of calculation and exchange of information with its neighboring nodes

            $\to$ A node gradually calculates the least-cost path to a destination or set of destinations
        * *Example*. Distance-vector (DV) algorithm, i.e. each node maintains a vector of estimates of the costs, i.e. distances, to all other nodes in the network
* *Classification by dynamicity*.
    * *Static routing algorithms*. Routes change very slowly over time, often as a result of human intervention
    * *Dynamic routing algorithms*. Routing paths are changed as the network traffic loads or topology change
        * *Idea*. Can be run either periodically, on in direct response to topologyu or link cost changes
        * *Pros*. More responsive to network changes
        * *Cons*. More susceptible to problems such as routing loops and oscillation in routes
* *Classification by load sensitivity*.
    * *Load-sensitive algorithm*. Link costs vary dynamically to reflect the current level of congestion in the underlying link

        $\to$ If a high cost is associated with a link, which is currently congested, a routing algorithm will tend to choose routes around such a congested link
    * *Load-insensitive algorithms*. A link's cost does not explicitly reflect its current level of congestion

        $\to$ Today's Internet routing algorithms are load-insensitive

## The link-state (LS) routing algorithm
**Network topology and link costs acquisition**. In practice, these things are acquired by having each node broadcast link-state packets to all other nodes in the network
* *Link-state packet*. Contain the identities and costs of its attached links
* *Link-state broadcast algorithm*. The result of the node's broadcast is that all nodes have an identical and complete view of the network

    $\to$ Each node can run the LS algorithm and compute the same set of least-cost paths as every other node

**LS routing algorithm**. Use global shortest-path algorithms link Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest path in a graph
* *Dijkstra's algorithm*. An iterative algorithm for solving the shortest-path problem
    * *Property*. After the $k$-th iteration of the algorithm, 
        * The least-cost paths are known to $k$ destination nodes
        * Among the leats-cost paths to all destination nodes, these $k$ paths will have the $k$ smallest costs
    * *Assumptions*.
        * $D(v)$ is the cost of the least-cost path from the source node to the destination $v$ as of this iteration of the algorithm
        * $p(v)$ is the previous node, i.e. neighbor of $v$, along the current least-cost path from the source to $v$
        * $N'$ is a subset of nodes, where $v\in N'$ if the least-cost path from the source to $v$ is definitely known
    * *Algorithm pseudo-code*.

        ```python
        # initialization
        N' = {u}
        for all nodes v
            if v is a neighbor of u
                then D(v) = c(u, v)
            else D(v) = infty
        
        # loop
        find w not in N' such that D(w) is a minimum
        add w to N'
        update D(v) for each neighbor v of w and not in N':
            D(v) = min(D(v), D(w) + c(w,v))
        until N' = N
        ```
* *Results of LS routing algorithm*. Each node has its predecessor along the least-cost path from the source node

    $\to$ For each predecessor, we also have its predecessor, and so in this manner
    * *Consequence*. We can construct the entire path form the source to all destinations
* *Forwarding table*. The forwarding table in a node $u$ can be constructed from this information by storing, for each destination, the next-hop node on the least-cost path from $u$ to the destination
* *Computational complexity*. $O(n^2)$ in case of Dijkstra's algorithm

**Possible pathology**. Consider a simple network topology as given below, where link costs are equal to the load carried on the link, i.e. reflect the delay which would be experienced

$\to$ Link costs are not symmetric, i.e. $c(u,v)\neq c(v,u)$

    <figcaption>Oscillations with congestion-sensitive routing</figcaption>
</div>

* *Scenario*. 
    * Node $z$ originates a unit of traffic destined for $w$
    * Node $x$ originates a unit of traffic destined for $w$
    * Node $y$ injects an amount of traffic equal to $e$, also destined for $w$
* *Routing algorithm execution*. Illustrated in the figure above
* *Problem*. As the routers detect better paths, they will change their routing strategy, leading to changes in link costs

    $\to$ Changes in link costs lead to changes in shortest paths from each router to their desired destination
    * *Solution 1*. Mandate that link costs not depend on the amount of traffic carried

        $\to$ This is unacceptable, since one goal of routing is to avoid highly congested links
    * *Solution 2*. Ensure that not all routers run the LS algorithm at the same time
        * *Explain*. We hope that, even if routers ran the LS algorithm with the same periodicity, the execution instance of the algorithm would not be the same at each node
        * *Self synchronization between routers*. Routers in the Internet can self-synchronize among themselves
            * *Explain*. Even though they initially execute the algorithm with the same period, but at different instants of time

                $\to$ The algorithm execution instance can eventually become, and remain, synchronized at the routers
            * *Solution to avoid self-synchronization*. Each router randomizes the time it sends out a link advertisement

## Distance-vector (DV) routing algorithm
**Key properties**. DV algorithm is iterative, asynchronous, and distributed,, hence much more interesting and fun than a centralized algorithm
* *Distribution*. Each node receives some information from one or more of its directly attached neighbors, perform a calculation, and distributes the results of its calculation baack to its neighbors
* *Iterativity*. The process continues on until no more information is exchanged between neighbors
    * *Self-determination*. The algorithm is self-terminating, i.e. there is no signal that the computation should stop, it just stops
* *Asynchronous*. The algorithm does not require all of the nodes to operate in lockstep with each other

**Relationship among the costs of the least-cost paths**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $d_x(y)$ is the cost of the least-cost path from node $x$ to node $y$
* *Bellman-Ford equation*. Relate the least costs of the least-cost paths

    $$d_x(y)=\min_v\{c(x,y) + d_v(y)\}$$

* *Practical importance of Bellman-Ford equation*.
    * The solution to the Bellman-Ford equation provides the entries in the node's $x$ forwarding table
        * *Explain*. Let $v^*$ be any neighboring node achieving the minimum in Bellman-Ford equation, then if node $x$ wants to send a packet to node $y$ along a least-cost path

            $\to$ It should forward the packet to node $v^*$
            * *Consequence*. Node $x$'s forwading table would specify node $v^*$ as the next-hop router for the ultimate destination $y$
    * It suggests the form of the neighbor-to-neighbor communication, which will take place in the DV algorithm

**Basic idea of DV algorithm**. Each node $x$ begins with $D_x(y)$, an estimate of the cost of the least-cost path from itself to $y$, for all nodes $y\in N$
* *Information maintained by each node $x$*. Let $\mathbf{D}_x=\{D_x(y):y\in N\}$, then each node $x$ maintains the following routing information
    * For each neighbor $v$ of $x$, the cost $c(x,v)$ from $x$ to directly attached neighbor $v$
    * Node $x$'s distance vector, i.e. $\mathbf{D}_x$, containing $x$'s estimate of its cost to all destinations $y\in N$
    * The distance vectors of each of its neighbors, i.e. $\mathbf{D}_v=\{D_v(y):y\in N\}$ for each neighbor $v$ of $x$
* *Implementation in the distributed, asynchronous algorithm*. From time to time, each node sends a copy of its distance vector to each of its neighbors
    1. When a node $x$ receives a new distance vector from any of its neighbor $v$, it saves $v$'s distance vector
    2. $x$ then uses the Bellman-Ford equation to update its own distance vector, i.e.

        $$\forall y\in N, D_x(y)=\min_y\{c(x,v) + D_v(y)\}$$
    3. If node $x$'s distance vector has changed, as a result of the update step, node $x$ will send its updated distance vector to each of its neighbors

        $\to$ The neighbors can update their own distance vectors
        * *Consequence*. As long as the nodes continue to exchange their distance vectors in an asynchronous fashion, each cost estimate $D_x(y)$ converges to $d_x(y)$, i.e. the actual cost of the least-cost path from $x$ to $y$

**Pseudo-code**.

```python
# initialization
for all destinations y in N:
    D_x(y) = c(x,y) # if y is not a neighbor then c(x,y) = \infty
for each neighbor w:
    D_w(y) = ? for all destinations y in N
for each neighbor w:
    send distance vector D_x to w

# loop
wait (until I see a link cost change to some neighbor w or until I receive a distance vector from some neighbor w):
    for each![](https://i.imgur.com/AFUVGp6.png)
 y in N:
        D_x(y) = min_v{c(x,y) + D_v(y)}
    if D_x(y) changed for any destination y:
        send distance vector D_x to all neighbors

# loop forever ...
```

**Decentralization**. The DV algorithm is decentralized and does not use global information
* *Information kept by each node*. The only information a node will have is 
    * The costs of the links to its directly attached neighbors
    * Information it receives from these neighbors

### DV algorithm - Link-cost changes and link failure
**Simple example of DV algorithm**.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/4BEGZkD.png">
    <figcaption>Changes in link cost</figcaption>
</div>

* *When link-cost changes are decrement*. Only two iterations are required for the DV algorithm to reach a quiescent state
    1. At time $t_0$, $y$ detects the link-cost change, i.e. from 4 to 1, updates its distance vector, and informs its neighbors of this change
    2. At time $t_1$, $z$ receives the update from $y$ and updates its table, i.e. it computes a new least cost to $x$, i.e. from 5 to 2, and sends its new distance vector to its neighbors
    3. At time $t_2$, $y$ receives $z$'s update and updates its distance table. $y$'s least costs do not change, hence it does not send any message to $z$

        $\to$ The algorithm comes to a quiescent state
* *When link-cost chagnes are increment*.
    * *Procedure*.
        1. At time $t_0$, $y$ detects the link-cost change, i.e. from 4 to 60, it computes its new minimum-cost path to $x$, i.e.

            $$D_y(x)=\min\{c(x,y)+D_x(x), c(y,z)+D_z(x)\}=\min\{60+0, 1+5\}=6$$

            * *Problem*. This new cost is wrong, making $y$ route through $z$ to approach $z$
            * *Consequence*. As of $t_1$, we have a routing loop, i.e. $z$ routes through $y$ to approach $z$

                $\to$ The packet will bounce back and forth between $y$ and $z$ forever
        2. Since node $y$ has computed a new minimum cost to $x$, it informs $z$ of its new distance vector at time $t_1$
        3. Sometime after $t_1$, $z$ receives $y$'s new distance vector indicating that $y$'s minimum cost to $x$ is $6$

            $$\to$ $D_z(x)=\min\{50+0,1+6\}=7$$

            $z$ then informs $y$ of its new distance
        4. In similar manner, after receiving $z$'s new distance vector, $y$ determines $D_y(x)=8$ and sends $z$ its distance vector

            $\to$ $z$ determines $D_z(x)=9$ and sends $y$ its distance vector, and so on
    * *Count-to-infinity problem*. The problem with routing loop given above

### DV algorithm - ADding poisoned reserve
**Poisoned reverse**. The routing loop problem can be avoided using a technique known as poisoned reverse
* *Idea*. If $z$ routes through $y$ and get to $x$, then $z$ will advertise to $y$ that its distance to $x$ is infinity

    $\to$ $z$ will keep telling lie to $y$, as long as it routes to $x$ via $y$
    * *Consequence*. Since $y$ believes that $z$ has no path to $x$, it will never attempt to route to $x$ via $z$, as long as $z$ continues to route to $x$ via $y$
* *Problem*. Loops involving three or more nodes will not be detected by the poisoned reverse technique

### A comparison of LS and DV routing algorithms
**Message complexity**.
* *LS algorithm*. 
    * Require each node to know the cost of each link in the network, i.e. $O(|N| |E|)$ messages to be sent
    * Whenever a link cost changes, the new link cost must be sent to all nodes
* *DV algorithm*.
    * Require message exchanges between directly connected neighbors at each iteration

        $\to$ The time required for the algorithm to converge can depend on many factors
    * When link costs change, the DV algorithm will propagate the results of the changed link cost only if the new link cost results in a changed least-cost path for one of the nodes attached to the link

**Convergence speed**.
* *LS algorithm*. An $O(|N|^2)$ algorithm requiring $O(|N| |E|)$ messages
* *DV algorithm*. Converge slowly and can have routing loops while the algorithm is converging, as well as count-to-infinity problem

### Other routing algorithms
**Usage of LS and DV algorithms**. LS and DV algorithms are not only widely used in practice, they are essentially the only routing algorithms used in practice today in the Internet

**Network-flow-problem-based approach**. View the packet traffic as flows between source and destination in a network

$\to$ The routing problem can be formulated mathematically as a constrained optimization problem

**Circuit-switched routing algorithms**. Dervied from the telephony world
* *Usage*. In packet-switched data networking, in cases where per-link resources are to be reserved for each connection, which is routed over the link

## Hierachical routing
**Network in practice**. In practice, having a homogeneous set of routers all executing the same routing algorithm is a bit simplistic for severel reasons
* *Scale*. As the number of routers becomes large, the overhead involved in computing, storing, and communicating routing information becomes prohibitive
    * *Explain*. Today's public Internet consists of hundreds of millions of hosts
        
        $\to$ Storing routing information at each of these hosts would clearly require enormous amounts of memory
    * *LS algorithm*. The overhead required to broadcast LS updates among all of the routers in the public Internet would leave no bandwidth left for sending data packets
    * *DV algorithm*. Iteration among a large number of routers would never converge
* *Administrative autonomy*. These are important considerations
    * *Explain*. Ideally, an organization should be able to run and administer its network as it wishes

**Autonomous systems (ASs)**. Both problems above can be solved by organizing routers into ASs
* *Autonomous system*. Each AS consists of a group of routers, which are typically under the same administrative control, e.g. operated by the same ISP
    
    $\to$ Routers within the same AS all run the same routing algorithm and have information about each other
    * *Intra-autonomous system routing protocol*. The routing algorithm running within an AS
* *Gateway routers*. It is necessary to connect ASs to each other

    $\to$ One or more of the routers in an AS will have the added task of forwarding packets to destinations outside the AS, i.e. gateway routers
* *Routing packets to a destination outside the AS*. 
    * *One-gateway-router AS*. Each internal router knows how it should forward the packet, i.e.
        1. The gateway router, upon receiving the packet, forwards the packet on the one link leading outside the AS
        2. The AS on the other side of the link then routes the packet to its ultimate destination
    * *Multi-gateway-router AS*. The problem of knowing where to forward the packet becomes significantly more challenging
        * *Requirements*. 
            * The AS needs to learn which destinations are reachable via its neighboring ASs
            * The AS needs to propagate tyhis reachability information to all routers within it

                $\to$ Each router can configure its forwarding table to handle external-AS destinations
        * *Inter-AS routing protocol*. Solve the two requirements mentioned above
            * *Inter-AS routing protocol in the Internet*. In the Internet, all ASs run the same inter-AS routing protocol, called BGP4

**Hot-potato routing**.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/HQ4tVQe.png">
    <figcaption>Steps in adding an outside-AS destination in a router's forwarding table</figcaption>
</div>

* *Scenario*.
    * AS2 and AS3 connects to other ASs
    * AS1 learns from the inter-AS routing protocol that subnet $x$ can be reached from AS2, via gateway 1b, and from AS3, via gateway 1c
* *Problem*. How a router 1d in AS1 configure its forwarding table, i.e. it must determine to which gateway router, i.e. 1b or 1c, it should direct packets destined for $x$
* *Hot-potato routing*. An approach often used in practice
    * *Idea*. The AS gets rid of the packet, i.e. the hot potato, as quickly as possible, i.e. as inexpensively as possible

        $\to$ This is done by having a router send the packet to the gateway router having the smallest router-to-gateway cost among all gateways with a path to the destination

**Routing information advertisement**. When an AS learns about a destination from a neighboring AS, it can advertise this routing information to some of its other neighboring ASs
* *Problem*. An AS has quite a bit of flexibility in deciding which destinations it advertises to its neighboring ASs

    $\to$ This is a policy decision, typically depending more on economic issues than on technical issues

**ISPs and ASs**.
* The routers in an ISP, and the links connecting them, constitute a single AS

    $\to$ This is often the case
* Many ISPs partition their network into multiple ASs
