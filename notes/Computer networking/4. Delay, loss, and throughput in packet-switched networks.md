# Delay, loss, and throughput in packet-switched networks
## Overview of delay in packet-switched networks
**The mode important delays**. The packet suffers from several types of delays at each node along its path

* Node processing delay, i.e. a packet's header must be examined by a router to determine the appropriate outbound link for the packet, then the packet will be directed to this link
* Queuing delay, i.e. a packet can only be transmitted on a link if 
    * There is no packet currently being transmitted on that link
    * There is no preceding packet in the queue
* Transmission delay
* Propagation delay 
* Total nodal delay, i.e. The accumulation of all delays
    * *Formal*. $d_\text{nodal} = d_\text{proc} + d_\text{queue} + d_\text{trans} + d_\text{prop}$

### Processing delay
**Processing delay**. Include the following factors
* The time required to examine the packet's header and determine where to direct the packet
* The time required to check for bit-level errors in the packet which occurred in transmitting the packet's bits from the upstream node to the current router

**Typical delay time**. In the order of microseconds or less

### Queueing delay
**Queue delay**. The time a packet waits to be transmitted onto the link
* *Aspects affecting queue delay*. The number of earlier-arriving packets, which are queued and wait for transmission onto the link

**Typical delay time**. In the order of microseconds

### Transmission delay
**Transmission delay**. The time required to push, i.e. transmit, all of the packet's bits into the link
* *Formal*. Assume that packets are transmitted in a FIFO manner, then the transmission delay is $L/R$ where
    * $L$ is the packet length
    * $R$ is the transmission rate of the link from the current router to the next router

**Typical delay time**. In the order of microseconds to milliseconds

### Propagation delay
**Propagation delay**. The time required to propagate from the beginning of the link to the next router
* *Explain*. Once a bit is pushed into the link, it needs to propagate to the next router
* *Aspect affecting propagation delay*. 
    * The physical medium of the link, e.g. fiber optics, twisted-pair copper wire, etc.
        * *Typical propagation speed*. $2\cdot 10^8$ meters/sec to $3\cdot 10^8$ meters/sec, i.e. a little less than the speed of light
    * *The distance between two routers*
* *Formal*. $d/s$ where $d$ is the distance between two routers, and $s$ is the propagation speed of the link

**Typical delay time**. In the order of milliseconds

### Comparing transmission and propagation delay
**Transmission and propagation delay**.
* *Transmission delay*. The time required for the router to push out the packet

    $\to$ This is a function of packet's length and the transmission rate of the link

    >**NOTE**. Transmission delay has nothing to do with distance between two routers

* *Propagation delay*. The time required for a bit to propagate from one router to the next

    $\to$ It is a function of the distance between two routers

    >**NOTE**. Propagation delay has nothing to do with the packet's length or transmission rate of the link

**Contributions of delay components**. Can vary significantly

## Queueing delay and packet loss
### Queuing delay
**The most complicated and interesting component of nodal delay**. The queueing delay $d_\text{queue}$
* *Explain*. The queueing delay can vary from packet to packet
* *Consequence*. When characterizing queuing delay, one typically use statistical measures, e.g. mean, variance, and confident interval, etc. of the queuing delay

**Traffic intensity**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $a$ is the average rate, at which packets arrive at the queue, i.e. packets per seconds
    * $R$ is the transmission rate, i.e. bits per seconds, at which bits are pushed out of the queue
    * $L$ is the packet length
    * The queue is infinitely large
* *The average rate of arriving bits*. $La$ bits/sec
* *Traffic intensity*. $La/R$
    * *Purpose*. Estimate the extent of queuing delay, i.e. 
        * If $La/R>1$, the queue tend to increase without bound, and the queing delay will approach infinity
        * If $La/R < 1$, the nature of the arriving traffic impacts the queuing delay, i.e. 
            * If the packets arrive periodically, then every packet will arrive at an empty queue

                $\to$ There will be no queuing delay
            * If packets arrive in bursts but periodically, there can be a significant average queuing delay
    * *Consequence*. We should design our system so that traffic intensity is no greater than 1

**Deterministic of queuing time**. Typically, the arriving process to a queue is random, and traffic intensity is not sufficient to fully characterize the queuing delay statistics

    <figcaption>Dependence of average queuing delay on traffic intensity</figcaption>
</div>

* *Observations*. As the traffic intensity approaches 1, the average queuing delay increases rapidly

    $\to$ A small percentage increase in the intensity will result in a much larger percentage-wise increase in delay

### Packet loss
**Packet loss**. A packet can arrive to find a full queue, and the router will drop that packet, i.e. the packet will be lost
* *Fraction of lost packets*. Increase as the traffic intensity increases

    $\to$ Performance of a node is often measured the probability of packet loss, besides delay

## End-to-end delay
**End-to-end delay**. 
* *Assumptions*.
    * There are $N-1$ routers, i.e. $N$ links, between the source host and the destination host
    * The network is uncongested, i.e. the queuing delays are negligible
    * $d_\text{proc}$ is the processing delay at each router, and at the source host
    * $R$ bits/sec is the transmission rate out of each router, and out of the source host
    * $d_\text{trans} = L/R$ where $L$ is the packet size
    * $d_\text{prop}$ is the propagation delay on each link
* *The nodal delay end-to-end*. $d_\text{end-end} = N (d_\text{proc} + d_\text{trans} + d_\text{prop})$

### Traceroute
**Traceroute**. A simple program running in any Internet host
* *Input*. A destination hostname
* *Functionality*. 
    1. The program  in the source host sends multiple, special packets toward the destination
    2. The packets pass through a series of routers, to the destination
    3. When a router receives one of these packets, it sends back to the source a short message containinig the name and address of the router\
* *Purpose*. 
    * Reconstruct the route taken by packets flowing from source to destination
    * Determine the round-trip delays to all the intervening routers
  
### End system, application, and other delays
**End system delay**. There can be additional significant delays in the end systems

### Throughput in computer networks
**End-to-end throughput**. Another critical performance measure in computer networks
* *Instantaneous throughput*. The rate (at any instant of time) in bits/sec, at which the destination host is receiving the file
* *Average throughput*. Let $F$ be the file length and $T$ is the time for the destination host to receive all $F$ bits

    $\to$ The average throughput of the file transfer is $F/T$ bits/sec

**Insight into the concept of throughput**.

    <figcaption>Throughput for a file transfer from server to client</figcaption>
</div>

* *Simple case*. There are only two links as illustrated above
    * *Assumptions*. 
        * $R_s$ and $R_c$ are the rate of the links in the figure
        * Only server and client are communicating upon these two links
    * *Obvsertaions*. 
        * The server cannot pump bits through its link at rate faster than $R_s$ bps
        * The client router cannot forward bits at a rate faster than $R_c$ bps
    * *Bottleneck link*. The throughput is $\min\{R_c,R_s\}$, i.e. the transmission rate of the bottleneck link

    >**NOTE**. This analysis applies for the case of $N$ links

* *Bottleneck link*. The link with lowest transmission rate
    * *Throughput of a file transfer from server to client*. Equal to the transmission rate of the bottleneck link, along the path between server and client
    * *Time to transfer a large file*. If the file size is $F$ bits and the transmission rate of the bottleneck link is $R$

        $\to$ The time required for transmission is $F/R$
