# Electronic mail in the Internet
**Electronic mail**. Be around since the beginning of the Internet
* *Future development*. Electronic mail was the most popular application when the Internet was in its infancy, and has become more and more elaborate and powerful over the years

    $\to$ It remains one of the Internet's most important and utilized applications
* *An asynchronous communication medium*. Electronic mail is an asynchronous communication medium

    $\to$ Peopl send and read messages when it is convenient for them, without having to coordinate with other people's schedules
* *Modern services provided*. Messages with attachments, hyperlinks, HTML-formatted text, and embedded photos
* *Pros*. Fast, easy to distribute, and inexpensive

**Higher-level view of the Internet mail system**. Consist of three major components, i.e. user agents, mail servers, and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)

* *Workflow*.
    * When Alice is finished composing her message, her user agent sends the message to her mail server
    * The mail server placed the message in the mail server's outgoing message queue
    * Then Bob wants to read a message, his user agent retrieves the message from his mailbox in his mail server
* *Main components*.
    * *User agents*. Allow users to read, reply to, forward, save, and compose messages
        * *Example*. Microsoft Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.
    * *Mail servers*. The core of the e-mail infrastructure
        * *Mailbox*. Each recipient has a mailbox located in one of the mail servers
            * *Responsibilities*. Manage and maintain the messages sent to the corresponding recipient
    * *SMTP*. The principal application-layer protocol for Internet electronic mail
        * *Idea*. Use the reliable data transfer service of TCP to transfer mail from the sender's mail server to the recipient's mail server
        * *Client-server model*. SMTP has client-server model
            * *Client side*. Execute on the sender's mail server
            * *Server side*. Execute on the recipient's mail server
        * *Implementation*. Both the client and server sides of SMTP run on every mail server
            * When a mail server sends mail to other mail servers, it acts as an SMTP client
            * When a mail server receives mail from other mail servers, it acts as an SMTP server
* *Message trajectory*. 
    1. The message starts the journey in the sender's user agent
    2. The message travels to the sender's mail server
    3. The message travels to the recipient's mail server
    4. The message is deposited in the recipient's mailbox
* *Message access with mailbox*. When Bob wants to access the messages in his mailbox

    $\to$ The mail server containing his mailbox authenticates Bob
    * *Message failure*. Alice's mail server must also deal with failures in Bob's mail server
        1. If Alice's server cannot deliver mail to Bob's server

            $\to$ Alice's server holds the message in a message queue and attempts to transfer the message later
            * *Reattempts frequency*. Reattempts are often done every 30 minutes or so
        2. If there is no success after several days, the server removes the message and notifies Alice with an e-mail message

## SMTP
**Reference documentation**. RFC 5321

>**NOTE**. SMTP is much older than HTTP

**Sending messages procedure with SMTP**.

<div style="text-align:center">

    <figcaption>Alice sends a message to Bob</figcaption>
</div>

1. Alice invokes her user agent for e-mail, provides Bob's e-mail address, e.g. `bob@someschool.edu`, composes a message, and instructs the user agent to send the message
2. Alice's uer agent sends the message to her mail server, where it is placed in a message queue
3. The client side of SMTP, running on Alice's mail server, sees the message in the message queue

    $\to$ It opens a TCP connection to an SMTP server, running on Bob's mail server
4. After some initial SMTP handshaking, the SMTP client sends Alice's message into the TCP connection
5. At Bob's mail server, the server side of SMTP receives the message

    $\to$ Bob's mail server then places the message in Bob's mailbox
6. Bob invokes his user agent to read the message at his convenience

**Intermediate mail servers**. SMTP does not normally use intermediate mail servers for sending mail, even when the two mail servers are located at opposite ends of the world

**Message transfer with SMTP**. 
1. The client SMTP, running on the sending mail server host, has TCP establish a connection to port 25 at the server SMTP, running on the receiving mail server host
    * *Connection failure handling*. If the server is down, the client tries again later
2. Once the connection is established, the server and client perform some application-layer handshaking
    * *Another interpretation*. SMTP clients and servers introduce themselves before transferring information
    * *Handshaking procedure*. The SMTP client indicates the e-mail address of the sender, and the e-mail address of the recipient
3. Once the SMTP client and server have introduced themselves to each other, the client sends the message
    * *Reliability of communication*. SMTP can count on the reliable data transfer service of TCP to get the message to the server without errors
4. Step 3 is repeated over the same TCP connection if it has other messages to send to the server, otherwise, it instructs TCP to close the connection

**Direct interaction with a mail server**. We can do this via `telnet serverName 25` then you (C) can interacts with the mail server (S)
* *Common commands*. `HELO`, `MAIL FROM`, `RCPT TO`, `DATA`, `QUIT`
* *Example script*.

## Comparision with HTTP
**Similarities**.
* *File transfer protocols*. Both SMTP and HTTP are used to transfer files from one host to another
    * *HTTP*. Transfer files, i.e. objects, from a Web server to a Web client
    * *SMTP*. Transfer files, i.e. e-mails, from a mail server to another mail server
* *Consistent connections*. Both use consistent TCP connections

**Differences**. 
* *Pull and push protocols*.
    * HTTP is mainly a pull protocol, i.e. someone loads information on a Web server and users use HTTP to pull the information from the server at their convenience

        $\to$ TCP connection is initiated by the machine wanting to receive the file
    * SMTP is mainly a push protocol, i.e. the sending mail server pushes the file to the receiving mail server

        $\to$ TCP connection is initiated by the machine wanting to send the file
* *Message encoding*. 
    * SMTP requires each message, including the message body, to be in 7-bit ASCII format

        $\to$ If the message contains characters which are not 7-bit ASCII, or contain binary data, then the message has to be encoded to 7-bit ASCII
    * HTTP data does not impose this restriction
* *Multi-media document handling*.
    * HTTP encapsulates each object with its own HTTP response message
    * Internet mail places all of the message' objects into one message

## Mail message formats
**Message header**. When an e-mail message is sent from one person to another

$\to$ A header containing peripheral information precedes the body of the message
* *Reference documentation*. RFC 5322
* *Header-body seperation*. Use a blank line, i.e. `CRLF`
* *Header lines*.

    ```
    From: alice@univ1.fr
    To: bob@univ2.uk
    Subject: Some subject.
    ```

**SMTP commands and message header**. SMTP has commands `MAIL FROM` and `RCPT TO` but these commands are part of SMTP handshaking protocol, while the header lines are part of the mail message itself

## Mail access protocols
**Client-server architecture for mail access**.
* *Traditional approach*. Bob reads his mail by logging onto the server host, then executes a mail reader running on that host
* *Modern approach*. Bob reads e-mail with a client executing on hist end system
    
    $\to$ Bob enjoys a rich set of features, including the ability to view multimedia messages and attachments

**Mail server in user's end system**. Place a mail server on the local PC of the user

$\to$ The sender's mail server would dialogue directly with receiver's end system
* *Problem*. A mail server manages mailboxes and runs the client and server sides of SMTP

    $\to$ If Bob's mail server were to reside on his local PC, then Bob's PC would have to remain always on, and connected to the Internet, to receive new mail, which can arrive at any time
* *Mailserver maintenance*. A mail server can be shared among many users and is typically maintained by the user's ISP

**E-mail message trajectory**. Alice's user agent uses SMTP to push the e-mail message into her mail server

$\to$ The mail server hen uses SMTP, as an SMTP client, to relay the e-mail message to Bob's mail server

>**NOTE**. Typically, the sender's user agent does not dialogue directly with the recipient's mail server

* *Why two-step procedure*. Without relaying through Alice's mail server, Alice's user agent does not have any recourse to an unreachable destination mail server
    * *Purpose of depositing the e-mail to the sender mail server*. 
        * *If Bob's mail server is down*. Alice's mail server can repeatedly try to send the message to Bob's mail server, e.g. every 30 minutes, until Bob's mail server becomes operational
        * *If Alice's mail server is down*. Alice has the recourse of complaining to her system administrator

**Receiving e-mail from mail servers**. Bob's user agent cannot use SMTP to obtain the messages

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ds2tI7B.png">
    <figcaption>E-mail protocols and their communicating entities</figcaption>
</div>

* *Explain*. Obtaining messages is a pull operation, while SMTP is a push protocol
* *Protocols for pulling messages*. Post Office Protocol - Version 3 (POP3), Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP), and HTTP

### POP3
**POP3**. An extremely simple, but functionally limited, mail access protocol
* *Reference documentation*. RFC 1939 (short and quite readable)
* *Communication process idea*.
    1. POP3 begins when the user agent, i.e. the client, opens a TCP connection to the mail server, i.e. the server, on port 110
    2. With the TCP connection established, POP3 progresses through three phases, i.e. authorization, transaction, and update
* *POP3 phases*. 
    * *Authorization*. The user agent sends a username and a password (in the clear) to authenticate the user
    * *Transaction*. The user agent retrieves messages, mark messages for deletion, remove deletion marks, and obtain mail statistics
    * *Update*. Occur after the client has issued the `quit` command, ending the POP3 session

        $\to$ The mail server deletes the messages marked for deletion

**POP3 authorization**. 
* *Principal commands*. `user <username>` and `pass <password>`
* *Example script*.

    ```bash
    telnet mailServer 110
    +OK POP3 server ready
    user bob
    +OK
    pass hungry
    +OK user successfully logged on
    ```

**POP3 transactions**. The user agent issues commands, and the server responds to each command with a reply
* *Possible responses*.
    * *`+OK`*. Used by the server to indicate that the previous command was fine

        >**NOTE**. This is sometimes followed by server-to-client data

    * *`-ERR`*. Used by the server to indicate that something was wrong with the previous command
* *User agent configuration*. A user agent using POP3 can often be configured by the user to "download and delete" or to "download and keep"

    $\to$ The sequence of commands issued by a POP3 user agent depends on which of the two modes the user agent is operating in
    * *Download-and-delete mode*. The user agent will issue `list`, `retr`, `dele`, and `quit` commands
        * *Fundamental commands*.
            * *`list` command*. List all e-mails
            * *`retr <index>`*. Retrieve e-mail with index `<index>`
            * *`dele <index>`*. Delete e-mail with index `<index>`
            * *`quit`*. Enter the update phase and remove the deletion-marked messages
        * *Problem*. The recipient, Bob, may be nomadic and may want to access his email messages from multiple machines

            $\to$ The download-and-delete mode partitions Bob's mail messages over the machines
            * *Explain*. If Bob reads a message on a machine, he will not be able to reread the message from other machine
    * *Download-and-keep mode*. The user agent leaves the messages on the mail server after downloading them

        $\to$ The user can reread messages from different machines

**State information**. The POP3 server maintains some state information during a session bewteen a user agent and the mail server

$\to$ It keeps track of which user messages have been marked deleted

### IMAP
**Message folder in POP3**. With POP3 access, once Bob has downloaded his messages to the local machine

$\to$ He can create mail folders and move the downloaded messages into the folders
* *Consequence*. Bob can delete messages, move messages across folders, and search for messages by sender name or subject
* *Problem with local message folders*. Nomadic users would prefer to maintain a folder hierachy on a remote server which can be accessed from any computer

    $\to$ This is not possible with POP3 since it does not provide any means for a user to create remote folders and assign messages to folders

**IMAP protocol**. Invented to support remote message directory

$\to$ It has many more features than POP3, thus significantly more complex
* *Reference documentation*. RFC 3501
* *Message folder in IMAP*. An IMAP server will associate each message with a folder
    * *Idea*. When a message first arrives at the server, it is associated with the recipient's INBOX folder

        $\to$ The recipient can then move the message into a new, user-created folder, read the message, delete the message, etc.
* *IMAP protocol*. Provide commands to 
    * Allow users to create folders and move messages from one folder to another
    * Allow users to search remote folders for messages matching specific criteria
    * Allow users to obtain components of messages, e.g. message header, or just part of a multipart MIME message

        $\to$ This is useful when there is a low-bandwidth connection between the mail server and the user agent
* *State information*. An IMAP server maintains user state information across IMAP sessions

### Web-based e-mail
**Recent trends**. Web-based e-mail is provided by every major university and corporation

**Architecture**.
* *User agent*. Implemented as an ordinary Web browser

    $\to$ The user communicates with its remote mailbox via HTTP
* *Message receiving protocol*. E-mail messages are sent from Bob's mail server to his browser using the HTTP protocol
* *Message sending protocol*. E-mails are sent from Alice's browser to her mail server over HTTP rather than SMTP

    >**NOTE**. Alice's mail server, however, still sends messages to, and receives messages from, other mail servers using SMTP
