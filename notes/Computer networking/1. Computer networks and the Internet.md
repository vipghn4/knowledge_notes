# Computer networks and the Internet
## What is the Internet
### A nuts-and-bolts description
**The Internet**. A computer network interconnecting hundreds of millions of computing devices throughout the world

* *Host and end systems*. In Internet terminologies, all of the devices are called host or end systems
    * *End systems*. Connected together by a network of communication links and packet switches
* *Communication links*. Made up of different types of physical media, e.g. coaxial cable, copper wire, optical fiber, and radio spectrum
    * *Transmission rate*. Different links can transmit data at different rates
        * *Unit of measurement*. bits/second
    * *Data transmission idea*.
        1. When one end system has data to send to another end system

            $\to$ The sending end system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment
        2. The resulting packages of information, known as packets, are then sent through the network to the destination end system
        3. The packets are reassembled into the original data at the destination end system

**Packet switch**. Take a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links
* *Two most prominent types of packet switch*.  Both types of swithces forward packets towards their ultimate destinations
    * *Routers*. Typically used in the network core
    * *Link-layer switches*. Typically used in access network
* *Route or path through the network*. The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system
* *Abstraction*.
    * Packets are similar to trucks
    * Communication links are similar to highways and roads
    * Packet switches are similar to intersections
    * End systems are similar to buildings

**Internet service providers (ISPs)**. End systems access the Internet through ISPs, each of which is a network of packet switches and communication links
* *Types of ISPs*.
    * *Residential ISPs*. Local cable or telephone companies
    * *Corporate ISPs*
    * *University ISPs*
    * *ISPs providing WiFi access in airports, hotels, coffee shops, and public places*
* *Functionality*.
    * Provide a variety of types of network access to the end systems
        * *Example*. Residential broadband access, e.g. cable modem or DSL, high-speed LAN access, wireless access, or dial-up modem access
    * Provide Internet access to connect providers, connecting Web sites directly to the Internet
* *Connections between ISPs*. The Internet is about connecting end systems to each other

    $\to$ The ISPs providing access to end systems must interconnected
    * *Connection method*. Lower-tier ISPs are interconnected through national and international upper-tier ISPs, e.g. Level 3 Communications, AT&T, Sprint, and NTT
* *Upper-tier ISP*. Consist of high-speed routers interconnected with high-spped fiber-optic links

**Protocols**.
* *ISP protocols*. Each ISP network, whether upper- or lower-tier, is managed independently, runs the IP protocol, and conforms to certain naming and address conventions
* *End systems and packet switches protocols*. End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run protocols controling the sending and receiving of information within the Internet
* *Common protocols*.
    * *Two of the most important protocols in the Internet*. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP)
        * *IP protocol*. Specify the format of the packets sent and received among routers and end systems
    * *The Internet's principal protocols*. Collectively known as TCP/IP
* *Protocol standards*. It is important that everyone agree on what each and every protocol does, so that people can create systems and products which interoperate
    * *Internet standards*. Developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), whose standards documents are called requests for comments (RFCs)

* *Access network*. A type of telecommunications network which connects subscribers to their immediate service provider
* *Core network*. Connect local providers to one anothe
