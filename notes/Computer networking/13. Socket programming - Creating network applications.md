# Socket programming - Creating network applications
**Network application**. Typically consist of a pair of programs, i.e. a client and a server programs, residing in two different end systems
* *Network application*. When the two programs are executed, a client process and a server process are created

    $\to$ These processes communicate with each other by reading from, and writing to, sockets
* *Developer main task*. Write code for both the client and server programs

**Types of network applications**.
* *Open applications*. An implementation, whose operation is specified in a protocol standard, e.g. RFC or some standard documentation
    * *Openness*. The rules specifying the application's operation are known to all

        $\to$ The client and server programs must conform the rules dictated by the RFC
    * *Example*. 
        * The client program could be an implementation of the client side of FTP protocol, which is explicitly defined in RFC 959
        * The server program could be an implementation of the FTP server protocol, which is explicitly defined in RFC 959
    * *Consequence*. If one developer writes code for the client program, and another one writes code for the server program

        $\to$ If both developers carefully follow the opened rules, then the two programs will be able to interoperate
    * *Benefits*. In today's network applications, communication between client and server programs are created by independent developers
* *Proprietary network application*. The client and server programs employ an application-layer protocol which has not been openly published in an RFC or elsewhere

    $\to$ A single developer, or an development team, creates both the client and server programs, and the developer has complete control over the code
    * *Drawbacks*. Other independent developers will not be able to develop code which interoperates with the application

**Transport protocol**. During the development phase, one of the first decisions the developer must make is whether the application is to run over TCP or UDP
* *TCP*. Connection-oriented and provide a reliable byte-stream channel, through which data flows between two end systems
* *UDP*. Connectionless and send independent packets of data from one end system to the other, without any delivery guarantees

**Well-known port numbers**. When a client or server program implements a protocol defined by an RFC

$\to$ It should use the well-known port number associated with the protocol
* *Consequence*. When developing a proprietary application, the developer must be careful to avoid using well-known port numbers

## Socket programming with UDP
### Introduction
**Developer control over communication**. The application developer has control of everything on the application-layer side of the socket, but has little control of the transport-layer side

**Interaction between two communicating processes using UDP sockets**. 
1. The sending process attaches a destination address to the packet
2. The sending process pushes the packet of data out the socket door
3. The Internet use the destination address to route the packet through the Internet to the socket in the receiving process
4. When the packet arrives at the receiving socket, the receiving process will retrieve the packet through the socket
5. The receiving process then inspects the packet's contents and take appropriate action

**Destination address of a packet**. Include the destination IP address, and a port number
* *IP address*. Help the Internet to route the packet through the Internet to the destination host
* *Port number*. A host may be running many network application processes, each with one or more sockets

    $\to$ Port number is the identifier assigned to a socket when the socket is created

**Source address of a packet**. Also attached to the packet, not by the UDP, but automatically by the underlying OS

### Hands-on
**Simple application to implement**.

1. The client reads a line of characters (data) from its keyboard, and sends the data to the server
2. The server receives the data and converts the characters to uppercase
3. The server sends the modified data to the client
4. The client receives the modified data and displays the line on its screen

**Implementation**.
* *Client*.

    ```python
    from socket import *

    serverName = "hostname"
    serverPort = 12000
    # AF_INET indicates that the underlying network is using IPv4
    # SOCK_DGRAM indicates that this is a IDP socket
    clientSocket = socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

    message = raw_input("Input lowercase sentence:")
    clientSocket.sendto(message, (serverName, serverPort))
    modifiedMessage, serverAddress = clientSocket.recvfrom(2048)
    print(modifiedMessage)
    
    clientSocket.close()
    ```

    * *`socket.SOCK_DGRAM`*. Indicate that this is a datagram-based protocol, i.e. we send one datagram and get one reply then the connection terminates

        $\to$ This is UDP transportation

* *Server*.

    ```python
    from socket import *
    
    serverPort = 12000
    serverSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)
    serverSocket.bind("", serverPort)
    print("The server is ready to receive")

    while True:
        message, clientAddress = serverSocket.recvfrom(2048)
        modifiedMessage = message.upper()
        serverSocket.sendto(modifiedMessage, clientAddress)
    ```

## Socket programming with TCP
**Connection-oriented protocol**. Before the client and server can start to send data to each other, they need to handshake and establish a TCP connection

$\to$ One end of the TCP connection is attachedto the client socket, and the other end is attached to a server socket
* *TCP connection socket*. We associate with it the client socket address (IP address and port number), and the server socket address (IP address and port number)

    $\to$ When one side wants to send data to the other side, it just drops the data into the TCP connection via its socket

**TCP connection initiation**. The client has the job of initiating contact with the server

    <figcaption>The client-server application using TCP</figcaption>
</div>

* *Server requirements*. To be able to react the client's initial contact, the server has to be ready, i.e.
    * The TCP server must be running as a process before the client attempts to initiate contact
    * The server program must have a special door, i.e. a special socket, which welcomes the initial contact from a client process running on an arbitrary host
* *TCP connection initiation from client side*. With the server process running
    1. The client program initiates the TCP connection by creating a TCP socket
    2. When the client creates its TCP socket, it specifies the address of the welcoming socket in the server
    3. After creating its socket, the client initiates a three-way handshakeand establishes a TCP connection with the server
            
        >**NOTE**. The three-way handshake, which takes place within the transport layer, is completely invisibile to the client and server programs

* *TCP connection initiation from server side*. When the server "hears the knocking" from the server, it creates a new socket dedicated to the client
* *TCP connection form*. From the application's perspective, the client's socket and the server's connection socket are directly connected by a pipe
    * *Reliable data transfer*. The client can send arbitrary bytes to its socket, and TCP guarantees that the server process will receiveeach byte in the order sent

        $\to$ TCP provides a reliable service between the client and server processes
    * *Two-way communication*.
        * The client process not only sends bytes but also receives bytes from its socket
        * The server process noy only receives bytes but also sends bytes to its connection socket
* *Address of server's welcome socket and connection socket*. The two sockets have the same address, i.e. IP address and port number
    * *How sever distinguishes between different clients listening to the same port*. Each connection is identified via its socket pair, i.e. the source and destination addresses of the source-destination socket pair

**Implementation**.
* *Client*.

    ```python
    from socket import *

    serverName = "servername"
    serverPort = 12000
    clientSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
    clientSocket.connect((serverName, serverPort))
    
    sentence = raw_input("Input lowercase sentence:")
    clientSocket.send(sentence)
    modifiedSentence = clientSocket.recv(1024)
    print("From server:", modifiedSentence)

    clientSocket.close()
    ```

* *Server*.

    ```python
    from socket import *

    serverPort = 12000
    serverSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM) # welcome socket
    serverSocket.bind("", serverPort)
    serverSocket.listen(1)
    print("The server is ready to receive")
    
    while True:
        connectionSocket, addr = serverSocket.accept()
        sentence = connectionSocket.recv(1024)
        capitalizedSentence = sentence.upper()
        connectionSocket.send(capitalizedSentence)
        connectionSocket.close()
    ```
