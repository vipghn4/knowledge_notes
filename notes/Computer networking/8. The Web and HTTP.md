# The Web and HTTP
## Overview of HTTP
**HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**. The Web's application protocol, which is the heart of the Web
* *Client program and server program*. Execute on different end systems, talk to each other by exchanging HTTP messages
* *Idea*. HTTP defines the structure of messages and how the client and server exchange the messages

**Web terminologies**.
* *Web page (document)*. Consist of objects, which are files, e.g. HTML file, JPEG file, etc. addressable by a single URL
    * *HTML file*. Most Web pages consist of a base HTML file and several referenced objects
* *Web browsers*. Implement the client side of HTTP

    $\to$ In the context of the Web, we will use the words browser and client interchangeably
* *Web servers*. Implement the server side of HTTP, house Web objects, each addressable by a URL

**HTTP roles**. Define how Web clients request Web pages from Web servers, and how Web servers transfer Web pages to clients

    <figcaption>HTTP request-response behavior</figcaption>
</div>

* *Idea*. 
    1. When a user requests a Web page, the browser sends HTTP request messages for the objects in the page to the server
    2. The server receives the requests and responds with HTTP response messages which contain the objects

**HTTP transport protocol**. TCP
* *Transportation procedure*.
    1. The HTTP client initiates a TCP connection with the server
    2. Once the connection is established, the browser and the server processes access TCP through their socket interfaces
        * The client sends HTTP request messages into its socket interface and receives HTTP response messages from its socket interface
        * The server receives request messages from its socket interface and sends response messages into its socket interface
    3. Once the client sends a message into its socket interface, the message is out of the client's hands and is in the hands of TCP

        $\to$ TCP provides a reliable data transfer service to HTTP, i.e. each HTTP request message sent by a client process eventually arrives intact at the server
* *Advantage of layered architecture in HTTp*. HTTP need not worry about lost data or the details of how TCP recovers from loss or reordering of data within the network

**Statelessness**. The server sends requested files to clients without storing any state information about the client
* *Explain*. HTTP server maintains no information about the clients

    $\to$ HTTP is a stateless protocol

## Non-persistent and persistent connections
**Types of connections**. The client and server communicate for an extended period of time, with the client making a series of requests, and the server responding to each of the requests
* *Types of request series*. Depending on the application and on how the application is being used
    
    $\to$ The series of requests may be back-to-back, periodically at regular intervals, or intermittently
* *Seperations of connections*. 
    * *Non-persistent connections*. Each request / response pair is sent over a separate TCP connection
    * *Persistent connections*. All of the requests and their corresponding responses be sent over the same TCP connection

### HTTP with non-persistent connections
**Non-persistent connections and file transfer**. TCP connection transports exactly one request message and one response message
1. The HTTP client process initiates a TCP connection to the server on port number 80, i.e. the default port number for HTTP
    * *Sockets*. Associated with the TCP connection, there will be a socket at the client and a socket at the server
2. The HTTP client sends an HTTP request message to the server via its socket, e.g. `/someDepartment/home.index`
3. The HTTP server process receives the request message via its socket, retrieves the object `/someDepartment/home.index` from its storage, encapsulates the object in an HTTP response message, and sends the response message to the client via its socket
4. The HTTP server process tells TCP to close the TCP connection

    >**NOTE**. TCP does not actually terminate the connection until it knows for sure that the client has received the response message intact

5. The HTTP client receives the response message, and the TCP connection terminates

    $\to$ The message indicates that the encapsulated object is an HTML file
6. The client extracts the file from the response message, examines the HTML file, and finds references to the objects in the file
7. The first four steps are repeated for each of the referenced object in the HTML file

**Web page display**. As the browser receives the Web page, it displays the page to the user

>**NOTE**. Different browsers may interpret, i.e. display to the user, a Web page in somewhat different ways

**Parallel TCP connections**. Users can configure modern browsers to control the degree of parallelism
* *Default mode*. Open 5 to 10 parallel TCP connections, each of which handles one request-response transaction
* *Sequential connections*. When the maximum number of parallel connections is set to one

**Round-trip time (RTT)**. The time it takes for a small packet to travel from client to server, then back to client
* *What happens when a user clicks on a hyperlink*.
    1. The browser initiate a TCP connection between the browser and the Web server, involving three-way handshake
        1. The client sends a small TCP segment to the server
        2. The server acknowledges and responds with a small TCP segment
        3. The client acknowledges back to the server
    2. The server sends the HTML file into the TCP connection
* *RTT of transmission procedure*. The total response time is roughly two RTTs, plus the transmission time at the server of the HTML file
    * The first two parts of the handshake take one RRT
    * The third part of the handshake and the last communication step takes a RRT, plus time to transmit the data

### HTTP with persistent connections
**Drawbacks of non-persistent connections**.
* A brand-new connection must be established and maintained for each requested object
* For each of these connections, TCP buffers must be allocated, and TCP variables must be kept in both client and server

    $\to$ This can place a significant burden on the Web server, which may be serving requests for hundreds of different clients simultaneously
* Each object suffers a delivery delay of two RTTs

**Persistent connections**. The server leaves the TCP connection open after sending a response

$\to$ Subsequent requests and responses between the same client and server can be sent over the same connection
* *Consequences*. Multiple Web pages residing on the same server can be sent from the server to the same client over a single persistent TCP connection

    $\to$ These requests for objects can be made back-to-back, without waiting for replies to pending requests (pipelining)
* *Connection termination*. The HTTP server typically closes a connection when it is not used for a certain time, i.e. a configurable timeout interval

    $\to$ When the server receives the back-to-back requests, it sends the objects back-to-back

**Default mode of HTTP**. Use persistent connections with pipelining

## HTTP message format
### HTTP request message
**Sample HTTP request message**.

```bash
GET /somedir/page.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.someschool.edu
Connection: close
User-agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept-language: fr
```

* *Message format*. Written in ordinary ASCII text, so computer-literate human being can read it
* *Message structure*. Ther are five  lines, each followed by a carriage return and a line feed

    >**NOTE**. A request message can have many more lines, or as few as oneline

**Message structure**.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gZysz5T.png">
    <figcaption>General format of an HTTP request message</figcaption>
</div>

* *Request line*. First line, with three fields, i.e. the method field, the URL field, and the HTTP version field
    * *Method field*. Can take on several different values, e.g. `GET`, `POST`, `HEAD`, `PUT`, or `DELETE`
* *Header lines*. The subsequent lines
    * *Host line*. Specify the host, on which they object resides
        * *Usage*. Requried by Web proxy caches

        >**NOTE**. There is already a TCP connection in place to the host
    
    * *Connection line*. Tell the server about the type of connection
    * *User-agent line*. Specify the user agent, i.e. the browser type making the request to the server
        * *Usage*. For server to send different versions of the same object to different types of user agents
    * *Accept-language line*. Indicate the language preferred by the user
* *Entity body*. 
    * *For `GET` method*. This part is empty
    * *For `POST` method*. The user fills out a form, e.g. search words to a search engine
        * *Effects*. The specific contents of the Web page depend on what the user entered into the form fields
        
        >**NOTE**. A request generated with a form does not necessarily use the `POST` method
        >* *Example*. HTML forms often use the `GET` method and include the inputted data, in the form fields, in the requested URL, e.g. `www.somesite.com/animalsearch?monkey&bananas`
    
    * *For `HEAD` method*. Similar to `GET`, i.e. when a server receives a `HEAD` request, it responds with an HTTP message but leaves out the requested object
        * *Usage*. Debugging purpose
    * *For `PUT` method*. Often used in conjunction with Web publishing tools
        * *Explain*. This method allows a user to upload an object to a specific path, or directory, on a specific Web server
        * *Usage*. Used by applications which need to upload objects to Web server
    * *For `DELETE` method*. Allow a user, or an application, to delete an object on a Web server

### HTTP response message
**Sample HTTP response message**.

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: close
Date: Tue, 09 Aug 2011 15:44:04 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS)
Last-Modified: Tue, 09 Aug 2011 15:11:03 GMT
Content-Length: 6821
Content-Type: text/html

(data data data data data ...)
```

**Message structure**. 
* *Status line*. First line, with three fields
    * The protocol version field
    * The status code
    * The corresponding status message
* *Header lines*. Next six lines
    * *Connection line*. As in request message
    * *Date line*. Indicate the time and date when the HTTP response was created and sent by the server

        >**NOTE**. This is not the time when object was created and sent by the server
    
    * *Server line*. Indicate that the message was generated by what type of server, i.e. similar to User-agent line in request message
    * *Last-modified line*. Indicate the time and date when the object was created or last modified
    * *Content-length*. Indicate the number of bytes in the object being sent
    * *Content-type*. Indicate that the type of object in the entity body
* *Entity body*. The meat of the message, i.e. containing the requested object

**Common error codes**.
* *`200 OK`*. Request succeeded and the information is returned in response
* *`301 Moved Permanently`*. Requested object has been permanently moved, with the new URL specified in `Location` header of the response message

    $\to$ The client software will automatically retrieve the new URL
* *`400 Bad Request`*. This is a generic error code indicating that the request could not be understood by the server
* *`404 Not Found`*. The requested document does not exist on this server
* *`505 HTTP Version Not Supported`*. The requested HTTP protocol version is not supported by the server

**Telnet**. Used to see a real HTTP response message

>**NOTE**. The HTTP specification defines many many more header lines which can be inserted in browsers, Web server, and network cache servers

**Header line generation**. 
* *Browser header line generation*. A browser will generate header lines as a function of 
    * The browser type and version
    * The user configuration of the browser
* *Web server header line generation*. There are different products, versions, and configurations, all of which influence which header lines are included in response messages

## User-server interactions - Cookies
**Problem**. HTTP is stateless, simplying server design and permit engineers to develop high-performance Web servers which can handle thousands of simultaneous TCP connections

$\to$ It is often desirable for a Web site to identify users

**Cookies**. Allow sites to keep track of users
* *Cookie components*.
    * A cookie header line in the HTTP response message
    * A cooker header line in the HTTP request message
    * A cookie file kept on the user's end system and managed by the user's browser
    * A back-end database at the Web site
* *Idea*.
    1. The first time a user visits a site, the user can provide a user identification, e.g. his or her name
    2. During the subsequent sessions, the browser passes a cookie header to the server, thus identifying the user to the server

        $\to$ Cookies can be used to create a user session layer on top of stateless HTTP
* *Cookie mechanism*.

    </div>

**Drawbacks**. Cookies are controversial since they can be considered as an invasion of privacy

## Web caching
**Web cache**. Also called a proxy server, is a network entity which satisfies HTTP requests on the behalf of an original Web server
* *Idea*. The Web cache has its own disk storage and keeps copies of recently requested objects in this storage

    $\to$ A user's broser can be configured so that all of the user's HTTP requests first directed to the Web cache
* *Web cache and client interaction*. Support a browser is requesting the object `http://www.someschool.edu/campus.gif`

    <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Kzv3vSR.png">
        <figcaption>Clients requesting objects through a Web cache</figcaption>
    </div>

    1. The browser establishes a TCP connection to the Web cache, and sends an HTTP request for the object to the Web cache
    2. The Web cache checks to see if it has a copy of the object stored locally

        $\to$ If it does, the Web cache returns the object within an HTTP response message to the client browser
    3. If the Web cache does not have the object, the Web cache opens a TCP connection to the original server, i.e. to `www.someschool.edu`
    4. The Web cache then sends an HTTP request for the object into the cache-to-server TCP connection
    5. After receiving the request, the original server sends the object within an HTTP response to the Web cache
    6. When the Web cache receives the object, it stores a copy in its local storage and sends a copy, within an HTTP response message, to the client browser

**Cache as a server and a client**. A cache is both a server and a client at the same time
* *Cache as a server*. When it receives requests from and sends responses to a browser
* *Cache as a client*. When it sends requests to and receives responses from an original server

**Web cache installation**. A Web cache is purchased and installed by an ISP

**Reasons for Web caching in the Internet**.
* A Web cache can substantially reduce the response time for a client request
    
    $\to$ Particularly if the bottleneck bandwidth between the client and the original server is much less than the bottleneck bandwidth between the client and the cache
    * *Explain*. If there is a high-speed connection between the client and the cache, as there often is, and if the cache has the requested object

        $\to$ The cache will be able to deliver the object rapidly to the client
* Web caches can substantially reduce traffic on an institution's access link to the Internet
    * *Consequence*. The institution does not have to upgrade bandwidth as quickly, thereby reducing cost
* Web caches can substantially reduce Web traffic in the Internet as a whole, improving performance for all applications

**Timing for getting objects with Web cache**. The time from the browser's request of an object until its receipt of the object

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7j4BnQq.png">
    <figcaption>Bottleneck between an institutional network and the Internet</figcaption>
</div>

* *Formula*. The sum of the LAN delay, the access delay, and the Internet delay
* *Problem*. The traffic intensity on the LAN is quite low compared to which on the access link (from the Internet router to the institutional router)
    * *Explain*. This is due to the low bandwidth of the institutional-to-Internet accesse link
    * *Solution 1*. Increase the access bandwidth to lower the traffic intensity to the access link
        * *Drawback*. The institution must upgrade its access link with a costly price
    * *Solution 2*. Install a Web cache in the institutional network

        $\to$ This solution often provides an lower response time than solution 1, and it does not require the institution to upgrade its link to the Internet

**Content distribution networks (CDNs)**. Via CDNs, Web caches are increasingly playing an important role in the Internet
* *Content distribution networks (CDNs)*. A geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers

    $\to$ This is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end users
* *CDN company*. Install many geographically distributed caches throughout the Internet

    $\to$ This localizes much of the traffic

## The conditional GET
**Problem of Web caches**. The copy of an object in the cache may be stale, i.e. like cache coherence in computer architecture
* *Solution*. HTTP has a mechanism alloing a cache to verify that its objects are up-to-date

    $\to$ This is conditional GET

**Conditional GET**. An HTTP request message is conditional GET message if
* The request message uses the `GET` method
* The request message includes an `If-Modified-Since` header line

**Mechanism**.
1. On the behalf of a requesting browser, a proxy cache sends a request message to a Web server

    ```bash
    GET /fruit/kiwi.gif HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.exotiquecuisine.com
    ```

2. The Web server sends a response message with the requested object to the cache

    ```bash
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Sat, 8 Oct 2011 15:39:29
    Server: Apache/1.3.0 (Unix)
    Last-Modified: Wed, 7 Sep 2011 09:23:24
    Content-Type: image/gif

    (data data data data data ...)
    ```

3. The cache forwards the object to the requesting browser but also caches the object locally

    >**NOTE**. The cache also stores the last-modified date along with the object

4. One week later, another browser requests the same object via the cache, and the object is still in the cache
5. The cache performs an up-to-date check by issuing a conditional GET

    ```bash
    GET /fruit/kiwi.gif HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.exotiquecuisine.com
    If-modified-since: Wed, 7 Sep 2011 09:23:24
    ```

6. The Web server sends a response message to the cache depending on the status of the requested object

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Internet delay**. The time it takes from when a router on the Internet side of the access link forwards an HTTP request, until it receives the response

**Access delay**. The delay between two routers
