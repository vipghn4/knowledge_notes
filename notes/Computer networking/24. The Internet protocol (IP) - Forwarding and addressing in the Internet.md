# The Internet protocol (IP) - Forwarding and addressing in the Internet
**Versions of IP in use today**. IP protocol version 4, i.e. IPv4, and IP version 6, which has been proposed to replace IPv4

**Components making up the Internet's network layer**.

* *The IP protocol*. This is the topic of this section
* *The routing component*. Determine the path a datagram follows from source to destination
    * *Idea*. Use forwarding tables, which are used to forward packets through the network
* *The Internet control message protocol (IMCP)*. A facility to report errros in datagrams and respond to requests for certain network-layer information

## Datagram format
**Datagram**. A network-layer packet

>**NOTE**. Datagram plays a central role in the Internet, and every networking student and professional needs to see it, absorb it, and master it

**Datagram format**.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/4BwN1Z4.png">
    <figcaption>IPv4 datagram format</figcaption>
</div>

* *Version number*. Specify the IP protocol version of the datagram, i.e. for routers to determine how to interpret the remainder of the IP datagram

    $\to$ Since different versions of IP use different datagram formats
    * *Length*. 4 bits
* *Header length*. Since an IPv4 datagram can contain a variable number of options, which are included in the IPv4 datagram header

    $\to$ This field is required to determine where in the IP datagram the data actually begins
    * *Length*. 4 bits
    * *Typical value*. 20-byte, i.e. since most IP datagrams do not contain options
* *Type of service (TOS)*. Included in the IPv4 header to allow different types of IP datagrams, e.g. datagrams particularly requiring low delay, high throughput, or reliability, to be distinguished from each other
* *Datagram length*. The total length of the IP datagram, i.e. header plus data, measured in bytes
    * *Length*. 16 bits, i.e. the theoretical maximum size of the IP datagram is 65,535 bytes

    >**NOTE**. Datagrams are rarely larger than 1500 bytes

* *Identifier, flags, fragmentation offset*. These fields have to do with IP fragmentation (discussed later)
* *Time-to-live (TTL)*. Included to ensure that datagrams do not circulate forever, e.g. due to a long-lived routing loop, in the network
    * *Idea*. This field is decremented by one, each time the datagram is processed by a router

        $\to$ If the TTL field reaches 0, the datagram must be dropped
* *Protocol*. Used only when an IP datagram reaches its final destination
    * *Purpose*. Indicate the specific transport-layer protocol, to which the data portion of the IP datagram should be passed
    * *Similarity with port number fields in data segments*. The protocol number in the IP datagram has a role, which is similar to the port number field in the transport layer segment
        * *Explain*. 
            * The protocol number is the glue binding the network and transport layers together
            * The port number is the glue binding the transport and application layers together
* *Header checksum*. Aid a router in detecting bit errors in a received IP datagram
    * *Computation*. Treat each 2 bytes in the header as a number, and sum these numbers using 1s complement arithmetic
    * *Usage*. The router computes the header checksum for each received IP datagram and detects an error condition if the checksum carried in the datagram does not equal to the computed checksum

        $\to$ The router then typically discard datagrams header, for which an error has been detected

    >**NOTE**. The checksum must be recomputed and stored again at each router, since the TTL field, and possibly the options field, may change

    * *Why does TCP/IP perform error checking at both the transport and network layers*.
        * Only the IP header is checksummed at the IP layer, while the TCP/UDP checksum is computed over the entire TCP/UDP segment
        * TCP/UDP and IP do not necessarily both have to belong to the same protocol stack, i.e.
            * TCP can, in principle, run over a different protocol, e.g. ATM
            * IP can carry data, which will not be passed to TCP/UDP
* *Source and destination IP addresses*. When a source creates a datagram, it inserts its IP address into the source IP address field, and inserts the address of the ultimate destination into the destination IP address field
    * *Determining the destination addresss*. Often via DNS lookup
* *Options*. Allow an IP header to be extended
    * *Usage frequency*. Rarely used, hence the decision to save overhead by not including the information in options fields in every datagram header
    * *Problem*. There are two problems, which may become particularly important for IP processing in high-performance routers and hosts
        * Since datagram headers can be of variable length, one cannot determine a priori where the data field will start
        * Since some datagrams may require options processing and others may not

            $\to$ The amount of time required to process an IP datagram at a router can vary greatly
* *Data (payload)*. The raison d'etre for the datagram in the first place
    * *Typical content*. 
        * Contain the transport-layer segment, i.e. TCP or UDP, to be delivered to the destination
        * Other types of data, e.g. IMCP messages

**IP datagram header size in total**. Assume that the option field in IP header is none, then we have 20 bytes of header for an IP datagram, and 20 bytes of headers for the transport-layer data segment inside the datagram

$\to$ We have 40 bytes of header in total

### IP datagram fragmentation
**Problem**. Not all link-layer protocols can carry network-layuer packets of the same size

$\to$ Some protocol can carry big datagrams, while other protocols can carry only little packets
* *Maximum transmission unit (MTU)*. The maximum amount of data a link-layer frame can carry
    * *Consequence*. Since each IP datagram is encapsulated within the link-layer frame for transport from one router to the next one

        $\to$ The MTU of the link-layer protocol places a hard limit on the length of an IP datagram
* *Consequence* . Each of the links along the route between sender and destination can use different link-layer protocols

    $\to$ Each of these protocols can have different MTUs

**Fragmentation**.
* *Fragment*.
    * *Scenario*. Consider a router which interconnects several links, each running different link-layer protocols with different MTUs

        $\to$ Support we receive an IP datagram from one link, and the desired outgoing link has an MTU which is smaller than the length of the IP datagram
    * *Solution*. 
        1. Fragment the data in the IP datagram into two or more smaller IP datagrams
        2. Encapsulate each of the smaller IP datagrams in a separate link-layer frame
        3. Send thse frames over the outgoing link
    * *Fragment*. A smaller datagram
* *Fragment reassembling*. Fragments need to be reassembled before they reach the transport layer at the destination
    * *Explain*. Both TCP and UDP are expecting to receive complete, unfragmented segments from the network layer
    * *Problem*. Reassembling datagrams in the routers would introduce significant complication into the protocol and put a damper on router performance
        * *Solution*. The designers of IPv4 decided to put the job of datagram reassembly in the end systems, rather than in network routers, following the principle of keeping the network core simple
    * *Idea*.
        1. When a destination host receives a series of datagrams from the same source

            $\to$ It determines whether any of these datagrams are fragments of some original, larger one
        2. If some datagrams are fragments, it must further determine when it has received the last fragment, and how the fragments it has recevied should be pieced back to form the original datagram
    * *Support for reassembling fragments*. The designers of IPv4 put identification, flag, and fragmentation offset fields in the IP datagram header
        * *Idea*. 
            1. When a datagram is created, the sending host stamps the datagram with an identification number, and source and destination addresses

                $\to$ Typically, the sending host increments the identification number for each datagram it sends
            2. When a router needs to fragment a datagram, each resulting fragment is stamped with the source address, destination address, and identification number of the original datagram
            3. When the destination receives a series of datagrams from the same sending host

                $\to$ It can examine the identification numbers of the datagrams to determine which of the datagrams are actually fragments of the same larger one
    * *Reliability of IP service*. IP is an unreliable service, i.e. one or more of the fragments may never arrive at the destination, hence
        * For the destination host to be absolutely sure it has received the last fragment of the original datagram
            
            $\to$ The last fragment has flag bit set to 0, whereas all the other fragments have this flag big set to 1
        * For the destination host to determine whether a fragment is missing, the offset field is used to specify where the fragment fits within the original IP datagram
* *Passing reassembled datagram to transport-layer*. At the destination, the payload of the datagram is passed to the transport layer, only after the IP layer has fully reconstructed the original IP datagram

    $\to$ If one or more of the fragments does not arrive at the destination, the incomplete datagram is discarded, and not passed to the transport layer
    * *TCP reliable data transfer service*. If TCP is being used at the transport layer

        $\to$ TCP will recover from this loss by having the source retransmit the data in the original datagram`

**Cost of fragmentation**.
* Fragmentation complicates the routers and end systems, which need to be designed to accommodate datagram fragmentation and reassembling
* Fragmentation can be used to create lethal DoS attacks, where the attacker sends a series of bizarre and unexpected fragments

## IPv4 addressing
>**NOTE**. Addressing is not only a juicy, subtle, and interesting topic, but also one that is of central importance to the Internet

**How hosts and routers are connected into the network**.
* *Host-to-network link*. A host only hasa single link into the network
    
    $\to$ When IP in the host wants to send a datagram, it does so over this link
    * *Interface*. The boundary between the host and the physical link
* *Router and its interface*. Since a router's job is to receive a datagram on one link, and forward the datagram on some other link

    $\to$ A router necessarily has two or more links, to which it is connected
    * *Interface*. The boundary between the router and any one of its links

        $\to$ The router thus has multiple interfaces, one for each of its links
* *IP's requirements on hosts and routers*. Since every host and router is capable of sending and receiving IP datagrams

    $\to$ Each host and router interface must have its own IP address
    * *Consequence*. An IP address is technically associated with an interface, rather than with the host or router containing that interface

**IPv4 address structure**. Each IP address is 32-bit long, i.e. 4 bytes, and thus there are a total of $2^{32}$ possible IP addresses
* *Address expression*. These addresses are typically written in dotted-decimal notation, i.e.
    * Each byte of the address is written in its decimal form
    * Each byte is separated by a period, i.e. dot, form other bytes in the address
* *Uniqueness of address*. Each interface on every host and router in the global Internet must have an IP address, which is globally unique, except for interfaces behind NATs
    * *Picking an IP address*. IP addresses cannot be chosen in a willy-nilly manner

        $\to$ A portion of an interface's IP address will be determined by the subnet, to which it is connected
* *Example*. Consider the case where one router, with three interfaces, is used to interconnect seven hosts

    <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ud06WC2.png">
        <figcaption>Interface addresses and subnets</figcaption>
    </div>

**Subnet**. In IP terms, the network interconnecting three host interfaces and one router interface, as given in the example above, forms a subnet
* *Other names*. IP network, or simply a network in the Internet literature
* *Address assignment within a subnet*. IP addressing assigns an address to the subnet, e.g. `223.1.1.24` where the `/24` notation, sometimes known as a subnet mask
    * *Subnet mask*. Indicates that the leftmost 24 bits of the 32-bit quantity define the subnet address

        $\to$ Any host attached to the `223.1.1.0/24` subnet would be required to have an address of the form `223.1.1.xxx`
* *Examples of subnet*. 
    * *Example 1*. There is no router within a subnet, as given in the figure above

        $\to$ This network could be interconnected by an Ethernet LAN, in which case the interfaces would be interconnected by an Ethernet switch
    * *Example 2*. Consider the figure below, where three routers are interconnected with each other by point-to-point links

        $\to$ Each router has three interfaces, one for each point-to-point link, and one for the broadcast link, which directly connects the router to a pair of hosts

        <div style="text-align:center">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bngVxnp.png">
            <figcaption>Three routers interconnecting six subnets</figcaption>
        </div>

        * *Subnets*. 
            * There are three subnets `223.1.1.0/24`, `223.1.2.0/24`, and `223.1.3.0/24` as in type 1
            * There are subnet `223.1.9.0/24` for interfaces connecting routers R1 and R2, subnet `223.1.8.0/24` connecting routers R2 and R3, and subnet `223.1.7.0/24` connecting routers R3 and R1
* *Recipe to define thge subnets in the system*. To determine the subnets, 
    1. Detach each interface from its host and router
    2. Create islands of isolated networks, with interfaces terminating the end points of the isolated networks
    3. Each of these isolated networks is called a subnet

**Handle addressing in the global Internet**. 
* *Subnet addressing in principle and in practice*.
    * In principle, the different subnets could have quite different subnet addresses
    * In practice, their subnet addresses often have much in common
* *Classless interdomain routing (CIDR)*. The Internet's address assignment strategy, i.e. generalization of subnet addressing
    * *Idea*. As with subnet addressing, the 32-bit IP address is divided into two parts, and has the dotted-decimal form `a.b.c.d/x` where `x` indicates the number of bites in the first part of the address
        * *`x` most significant bits of the address*. Constitute the network portion of the IP address

            $\to$ This is referred to as the prefix, or network prefix, of the address
            * *Network prefix assignment*. An organization is typically assigned a block of contiguous addresses, i.e. a range of addresses with a common prefix

                $\to$ The IP addresses of devices within the organization will share the common prefix
            * *Network prefix address usage outside organization*. Only `x` leading prefix bits are considered by routers outside the organization's network
                * *Explain*. When a router outside the organization's network forwards a datagram, whose destination address is inside the organization

                    $\to$ Only the leading `x` bits of the address need to be considered
                * *Consequence*. The size of the forwarding table in these routers is considerably reduced
                    * *Explain*. A single entry of the form `a.b.c.d/x` is sufficient to forward packets to any destination within the organization
        * *The remaining bits*. Can be thought of as distinguishing among the devices within the organization, all of which have the same network prefix
            * *Usage*. When forwarding packets at routers within the organization
            * *Subnetting structure of lower-order bits*. These bits may or may not have an additional subnetting structure
    * *Reference documentation*. RFC 4632
* *Classful addressing*. The IP addressing strategy before CIDR was adopted
    * *Idea*. The network portions of an IP address were constrained to be 8, 16, or 24 bits in length
        * *"Classful" meaning*. Subnets with 8-, 16-, and 24-bit subnet addresses were known as class A, B, and C networks, respectively
    * *Drawback*. Depletion of address space, with poor utilization
* *Broadcast address `255.255.255.255`*. When a host sends a datagram with destiniation address `255.255.255.255`, the message is delivered to all hosts on the same subnet

    $\to$ Routers optionall forward the message into neighboring subnets as well, althought they usually do not

### Obtaining a block of addresses
**Obtaining a block of IP addresses**.
* *Option 1*.
    1. A network administrator may first contact its ISP, which would provide addresses from a larger block of addresses which had already been allocated to the ISP
    2. The ISP, in turn, could divide its address block into equal-sized contiguous address blocks, and give on of these blocks to each of organizations supported by this ISP
* *Option 2*. It must be a way for the ISP itself to get a block of addresses
    * *Internet coropration for associated names and numbers (ICANN)*. IP addresses are managed under the authority of ICANN, which is a nonprofit organization
        * *Roles*. 
            * Allocate IP addresses, and manage the DNS root servers
            * Assign domain names and resolving domain name disputes
        * *Idea*. ICANN allocates addresses to regional Internet registries, e.g. ARIN, RIPE, etc., which together form the Address supporting organization of ICANN (ASO-ICANN)

            $\to$ ASO-ICANN then handle the allocation and management of addresses with their regions

### Obtaining a host address - The dynamic host configuration protocol
**Obtaining a host address**. Once an organization has obtained a block of addresses, it can assign individual IP addresses to the host and router interfaces in its organization
* *Option 1*. A system administrator will typically manually configure the IP addresses into the router, often remotely, with a network management tool
* *Option 2*. Host addresses can also be configured using the Dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP)

**Dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP)**. Allow a host to obtain, i.e. be allocated, an IP address automatically
* *Functionality*.
    * *Static and dynamic IP addresses*. A network administrator can configure DHCP, so that 
        * *Option 1*. A given host receives the same IP address each time it connects to the network
        * *Option 2*. A host may be assigned a temporary IP address, which will be different each time the host connects to the network
    * *Information provided to a host*. DHCP also allows a host to learn addition information, e.g. its subnet mask, the address of its first-hop router, i.e. the default gateway, and the address of its local DNS server
* *DHCP as a plug-and-play protocol*. Due to DHCP's ability to automate the network-related aspects of connecting a host into a network
    
    $\to$ It is often referred to as a plug-and-play protocol
    * *Consequence*. This capacity is often very attractive to the network administrator, who would otherwise have to perform these tasks manually
    * *Other usage*. Widely used in residential Internet access networks, and in wireless LANs, where hosts join and leave the network frequently
* *DHCP as a client-server protocol*. A client is typically a newly arriving host wanting to obtain network configuration information, including an IP address for itself

    <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/v42x1XC.png">
        <figcaption>DHCP client-server scenario</figcaption>
    </div>

    * *DHCP server*. Each subnet will have a DHCP server, otherwise a DHCP relay agent, i.e. typically a router, knowing the address of a DHCP server for the network is required

    >**NOTE**. In the discussion below, we will assume that a DHCP server is available on the subnet
* *Reference documentation*. RFC 2131

**DHCP as a four-step rpocess from a newly arriving host**.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/kfaT6fj.png">
    <figcaption>DHCP client-server interaction</figcaption>
</div>

* *Step 1 - DHCP server discovery*. A newly arriving host must find a DHCP server, with which to interact

    $\to$ This is done using a DHCP discover message, which a client sends within a UDP packet to port 67
    * *Destination of the DHCP discover message*. The host does not know the IP address of the network, to which it is attaching, much less the address of a DHCP server for this network

        $\to$ The DHCP client creates an IP datagram containing its DHCP discovery message with the broadcast destination IP address `255.255.255.255`, and a source IP address of `0.0.0.0` 
    * *Consequence*. The DHCP client passes the IP datagram to the link layer, which then broadcasts this frame to all nodes attached to the subnet
* *Step 2 - DHCP server offer(s)*. A DHCP receiving a DHCP discover message responds to the client with a DHCP offer message, which is broadcast to all nodes on the subnet in the similar manner above
    * *Multiple DHCP servers on a subnet*. Since multiple DHCP servers can be present on the subnet

        $\to$ The client may find itself in the enviable position of being able to choose from among several offers
    * *Offer message*. Contain the transaction ID of the received discover message, the proposed IP address for the client, the network mask, and an IP address lease time
        * *IP address lease time*. The amount of time, for which the IP address will be valid
            * *Typical value*. Several hours or days
* *Step 3 - DHCP request*. The newly arriving client chooses from among one or more server offers, and respond to its selected offer with a DHCP request message, echoing back the configured parameters
* *Step 4 - DHCP ACK*. The server responds to the DHCP request message with a DHCP ACK message, confirming the requested parameters

    $\to$ Once the client receives the DHCP ACK, the interaction is complete, and the client can use the DHCP-allocated IP address for the lease duration
    * *Using an IP address beyond the lease' expiration*. DHCP provides a mechanism allowing a client to renew its lease on an IP address

### Network address translation (NAT)
**Problem**. With the proliferation of small office, home offer (SOHO) subnets, whenever a SOHO wants to install a LAN to connect multiple machines

$\to$ A range of addresses would need to be allocated by the ISP to cover all of the SOHO's machines
* *Consequence*. If the subnet grew bigger, a larger block of addresses would have to be allocated

    $\to$ We have several questions
    * What if the ISP already allocated the contiguous portion of the SOHO's network current address range
    * What typical homeowner wants, or should need, to know how to manage IP addresses in the first place
* *Solution*. Used network address translation (NAT)
* *Reference documentation*. RFC 2663, and RFC 3022

**Operation of a NAT-enabled router**. The NAT-enabled router, residing in the home, has an interface, which is part of the home network

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/HB8q9yJ.png">
    <figcaption>Network address translation</figcaption>
</div>

* *Addressing within the home network*. Exactly as we have discussed, i.e. all four interfaces in the home network have the same subnet address of `10.0.0.0/24`
* *Private networks*. The address space `10.0.0.0/8` is one of three portions of the IP address space, which is reserved as given in RFC 1918 for a private network

    $\to$ Packets forwarded beyond the private network into the larger global Internet cannot use these addresses
    * *Consequence*. We must use NAT
* *NAT-enabled router*. Do not look like a router to the outside world, instead, it behaves to the outside world, as a single device with a single IP address
    * *Explain*. In essence, the NAT-enabled router is hiding the details of the home network from the outside world
        * All traffic leaving the home router for the larger Internet has some source IP address, e.g. `138.76.29.7`
        * All traffic entering the home router must have a destination address of `138.76.29.7`
* *IP address of the home network computers and the router*. Both the home network computers and the router get their IP addresses from DHCP
    * *Explain*. The router gets its address from the ISP's DHCP, and runs a DHCP server to provide addresses to computers within the NAT-DHCP-router-controlled home network's address space

**NAT translation table at the NAT router**. If all datagrams arriving at the NAT router from the WAN have the same destination IP address

$\to$ How does the router know the internal host, to which it should forward a given datagram
* *Solution*. Use NAT translation table at the NAT router, and to include port numbers as well as IP addresses in table entries
* *Example*. Suppoer a user sitting in a home network behind host `10.0.0.1` requests a Web page on some Web server, i.e. port 80, with IP address `128.119.40.186`
    1. The host `10.0.0.1` assigns the arbitrary source port number, e.g. `3345`, and sends the datagram into the LAN
    2. The NAT router receives the datagram, generates a new source port number, e.g. `5001`, for the datagram
    3. The NAT router replaces the source IP address with its WAN-side IP address, and replaces the original source port number `3345` with the newly generated one `5001`
    4. NAT in the router also adds an entry to its NAT translation table

        $\to$ The Web server, blissfully unware that the arriving datagram containing the HTTP request has been manipulated by the NAT router
    5. The Web server responds with a datagram, whose destination address is the IP address of the NAT router, and whose destination port number of `5001`
    6. When the datagram arrives at the NAT router, the router indexes the NAT translation table
        
        $\to$ The router uses the destination IP address and destination port number to obtain the appropriate IP address, and destination port number, for the browser in the home network
    7. The router rewrites the datagram's destination address and destination port number, and forwards the datagram into the home network
* *Generating new source port number*. The NAT router can select any source port number, which is not currently in the NAT translation table

**Popularity of NAT**. NAT has enjoyed widespread deployment in recent years, but many purists in the IETF community object to NAT, i.e.
* Port numbers are meant to be used for addressing processes, not for addressing hosts

    $\to$ This violation can cause problems for servers running on the home network, since server processes wait for incoming requests at well-known port numbers
* Routers are supposed to process packets only up to layer, i.e. network layer
* The NAT protocol violates the end-to-end argument, i.e. hosts should be talking directly with each other, without interfering nodes modifying IP addresses and port numbers
* We should use IPv6 to solve the shortage of IP addresses, rather than recklessly patching up the problem with a stopgap solution like NAT

**NAT and P2P applications**. NAT interferes with P2P applications, e.g. file-sharing and VoIP applications
* *Explain*. In a P2P application, any particular peer A should be able to initiate a TCP connection to any other participating peer B

    $\to$ If peer B is behind a NAT, it cannot act as a server and accept TCP connections
* *Solution if A is not behind a NAT*. Peer A first contact peer B through an intermediate peer B, which is not behind a NAT, and to which B has established an ongoing TCP connection

    $\to$ Peer A then ask peer B, via peer C, to initiate a TCP connection directly back to peer A

### UPnP
**NAT traversal**. Increasingly provided by Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), which is a protocol allowing a host to discover and configure a nearby NAT
* *Requirements*. Both the host and the NAT be UPnP compatible
* *Idea*. With UPnP, an application running in a host can request a NAT mapping between its (private IP address, private port number) and the (public IP address, public port number) for some requested public port number

    $\to$ If the NAT accepts the request and creates the mapping, then nodes from the outside can initiates TCP connections to (public IP address, public port number)

    >**NOTE**. UPnP lets the application know the value of (public IP address, public port number), so that the application can advertise it to the outside world

## Internet control message protocol (ICMP)
**ICMP**. Used by hosts and routers to communicate network-layer information to each other
* *Usage*. For error reporting
    * *Example*. When running a Telnet, FTP, or HTTP session, we may encountered an error message, e.g. Destination network unreachable, having origins in ICMP

        $\to$ The router created and sent a type-3 ICMP message to our host indicating the error
* *ICMP and IP*. ICMP is often considered part of IP, but architecturally it lies just above IP, as ICMP messages are carried inside IP datagrams
    * *Explain
        * ICMP messages are carried as IP payload, just as TCP or UDP segments are carried as IP payload
        * When ahost receives an IP datagram with ICMP specified as the upper-layer protocol

            $\to$ It demultiplexes the datagram's contents to ICMP, just as it would demultiplex a datagram's content to TCP or UDP
* *References*. RFC 792

**ICMP message format**. ICP messages have a type and a code field, and contain the header and the first 8 bytes of the IP datagram causing the ICMP message to be generated in the first place

$\to$ This allows the sender to determine which datagram caused the error
* *ICMP message types*.

    </div>

>**NOTE**. ICMP messages are used not only for signaling error conditions

**Inspecting datagrams - Firewalls and intrusion detection systems**. 
* *Scenario*. Suppose we are assigned the task of administering ahome, departmental, university, or corporate network
    * *Problem*. Attackers, knowing the IP address range of our network, can easily send IP datagrams to addresses in the range
        * *Purpose*. These datagrams can do all kinds of deviouis things, including
            * Mapping our network with ping sweeps and port scans
                * *Ping sweep*. A basic network scanning technique used to determine which of a range of IP addresses map to live hosts
            * Crash vulnerable hosts with malformed packets
            * Flood servers with a deluge of ICMP packets
            * Infect hosts by including malware in the packets
    * *Popular defense mechanisms to malicious packet attacks*. Firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDSs)
* *Firewall*. As a network administrator, we may try installing a firewall between our network and the Internet
    * *Idea*. Firewalls inspect the datagram and segment header fields, denying suspicious datagrams entry into the internal network
    * *Example*. 
        * A firewall may be configured to block all ICMP echo request packets

            $\to$ This prevents an attacker from doing a traditional ping sweep across our IP address range
        * A firewall can block packets based on source and destination IP addresses and port numbers
        * A firewall can be configured to track TCP connections, granting entry only to datagrams belonging to approved connections
* *IDS*. Typically situated at the network boundary, performing deeper packet inspection
    
    $\to$ It examines not only header fields, but also the payloads in the datagram, including application-layer data
    * *Packet signature database*. An IDS has a database of packet signatures, which are known to be part of attacks

        $\to$ This database is automatically updated as new attacks are discovered
    * *Funtionality*. As packets pass through the IDS, the IDS attempts to match header fields and payloads to the signatures in its signature database

        $\to$ If such a match is found, an alert is created
    * *Intrusion prevention system (IPS)*. Similar to an IDS, except that it actually blocks packets, in addition to creating alerts

## IPv6
**History**. In the early 1990s, the Internet Engineering Task Force began an effort to develop a successor of IPv4 protocol
* *A primve motivation*. The realization that the 32-bit IP address space was beginning to be used up, with new subnets and IP nodes being attached to the Internet, and being allocated unique IP addresses, at a breathtaking rate
* *Consequence*. A new IP protocol, i.e. IPv6, was developed, which also be tweaked and augmented other aspects of IPv4, based on accumulated operational experience with IPv4

### IPv6 datagram format

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/wgNMjDO.png">
    <figcaption>IPv6 datagram format</figcaption>
</div>

**Most important changes introduced in IPv6**. Evident in the datagram format
* *Expanded addressing capabilities*. IPv6 increases the size of the IP address, from 32 to 128 bits, to ensure that the world won't run out of IP addresses
    * *Anycast address*. In addition to unicast and multicast addresses, IPv6 introduced a new type of address, i.e. anycast address
        * *Purpose*. Allow a datagram to be delivered to any one of a group of hosts
        * *Usage*. Used to send an HTTP GET to the nearest of a number of mirror sites containing a given document
* *A streamlined 40-byte header*. A number of IPv4 fields have been dropped or made optional, resulting in a 40-byte fixed-length header

    $\to$ This allows for faster processing of the IP datagram
    * *Option processing*. A new encoding of options allows for more flexible options processing
* *Flow labeling and priority*. IPv6 has an elusive definition of a flow
    * *Flow labeling (as given in RFCs)*. Allow labeling of packets belonging to particular flows, for which the sender requests special handling, e.g. nondefault quality of service, or real-time service
        * *Example*. 
            * Audio and video transmission may likely be treated as a flow
            * Traditional applications, e.g. file transfer and e-mail, may not be treated as flows
            * It is possible that the traffic carried by a high-priority user may also be treated as a flow
    * *Priority*. The IPv6 header also has an 8-bit traffic class field, like TOS field in IPv4
        * *Usage*. 
            * Give priority to certain datagrams within a flow
            * Give priority to datagrams from certain applications, e.g. ICMP, over datagrams from other applications, e.g. network news
    * *Reference*. RFC 1752 and RFC 2460

**Other header fields in IPv6**. The following fields are defined in IPv6
* *Version*. Identify the IP version number, i.e. 6 for IPv6

    >**NOTE**. Putting a 4 in this field does not create a valid IPv4 datagram

    * *Length*. 4 bits
* *Traffic class*. Similar in spirit to the TOS field in IPv4
    * *Length*. 8 bits
* *Flow label*. As mentioned above, this is used to identify a flow of datagrams
    * *Length*. 20 bits
* *Payload length*. Treated as an unsigned integer giving the number of bytes in the IPv6 datagram following the fixed-length, 40-byte datagram header
    * *Length*. 16 bits
* *Next header*. Identify the protocol, to which the contents, i.e. data field, of this datagram will be delivered, e.g. TCP or UDP

    $\to$ This field uses the same values as the protocol field in IPv4 header
* *Hop limit*. Decremented by one by each router that forwards the datagram

    $\to$ If the hop limit count reaches zero, the datagram is discarded
* *Source and destination addresses*. The various formats of the IPv6 128-bit addresses are given in RFC 4291
* *Data*. The payload portion of the IPv6 datagram, i.e. when the datagram reaches its destination

    $\to$ The payload will be removed from the IP datagram, and passed onto the protocol specified in the next header field

**Header fields in IPv4 but removed in IPv6**.
* *Fragmentation / Reassembly*. IPv6 does not allow for fragmentation and reassembly in intermediate routers, i.e. these operations can be performed only by the source and destination
    * *Too large datagrams*. If an IPv6 datagram received by a router is too large to be forwarded over the outgoing link
        1. The router simply drops the datagram and sends a "Packet too big" ICMP error message back to the sender
        2. The sender can resend the data, using smaller IP datagram size
    * *Motivation of removal*. Fragmentation and reassembly is a time-consuming operation, thus removing this functionality from the routers and placing it squarely in the end systems considerably speeds up IP forwarding within the network
* *Header checksum*. Since the transport-layer, e.g. TCP and UDP, and link-layer, e.g. Ethernet, protocols in the Internet layers perform check-summing

    $\to$ This header field was sufficiently redundant in the network layer, that it could be removed
    * *Motivation of removal*. Fast processing of IP packets was a central concern, since the IPv4 header contains a TTL field, which is similar to the hop limit field in IPv6

        $\to$ The IPv4 header checksum needed to be recomputed at every router
        * *Consequence*. With fragmentation and reassembly, this was a costly operation in IPv4
* *Options*. An option field is removed from the standard IP header

**ICMPv6**. A new version of ICMP has been defined for IPv6 in RFC 443
* *Idea*. In addition to reorganizing the existing ICMP type and code definitions, ICMPv6 also added new types and codes required by the new IPv6 functionality
* *ICMPv6 and IGMP*. ICMPv6 subsumes the functionality of the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), which is used to manage a host's joining and leaving of multicast groups

### Transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6
**Problem**. While new IPv6-capable systems can be made backware-compatible, i.e. send, route, and receive IPv4 datagrams

$\to$ Already-deployed IPv4-capable systems are not capable of handling IPv6 datagrams

**Flag day solution**. Declare a flag day, i.e. a given time and date when all Internet machines would be turned off and upgraded from IPv4 to IPv6
* *Historical usage*. The last major technology transition, from using NCP to using TCP for reliable transport service, occurred almost 25 years ago
* *Drawback*. Even when the Internet was tiny and still being administered by a small number of wizards

    $\to$ Such a flag day was not possible
    * *Explain*. A flag day involves hundreds of millions of machines and millions of network administrators and users

**Dual-stack solution**. The most straightforward way to introduce IPv6-capable nodes

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/0eQ48Xz.png">
    <figcaption>A dual-stack approach</figcaption>
</div>

* *Idea*. IPv6 nodes also have a complete IPv4 implementation, i.e. IPv6/IPv4 node as referred in RFC 4213

    $\to$ When interoperating with IPv4, such a node can use IPv4 datagrams, and the similar happens when interoperating with IPv6
* *Address mode identification*. IPv6/IPv4 must have both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses, thus they must be able to determine whether another node is IPv6-capable or IPv4-only
    * *Solution*. Use the DNS, which can return an IPv6 address if the node name being resolved is IPv6-capable, otherwise return an IPv4 address

        >**NOTE**. If the querying node is only IPv4-capable, the DNS returns only an IPv4 address
* *Problem*. Two far-away IPv6-capable nodes may end up, in essence, sending IPv4 datagrams to each other

**Tunneling solution**. Solve the problem of dual-stack solution

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ggK7rBx.png">
    <figcaption>Tunneling</figcaption>
</div>

* *Idea*. Suppose two IPv6 nodes want to interoperate using IPv6 datagrams, but are connected to each other by intervening IPv4 routers
    
    $\to$ We refer to the intervening set of IPv4 routers between two IPv6 routers as a tunnel
* *Data transfer with tunnels*. 
    1. The IPv6 node on the sending side of the tunnel takes the entire IPv6 datagram and puts it in the payload field of an IPv4 datagram
    2. The IPv4 datagram is then addressed to the IPv6 node on the receiving side of the tunnel
    3. The IPv4 datagram is sent to the first node in the tunnel
    4. The intervening IPv4 routers in the tunnel route this IPv4 datagram among themselves
    5. The IPv6 node on the receiving side of the tunnel eventually receives the IPv4 datagram, determines that the datagram contains an IPv6 datagram

        $\to$ It extracts the IPv6 datagram, then routes the IPv6 datagram

**Lesson from IPv6 experience**. It is enormously difficult to change network-layer protocols

## A brief foray into IP security
**Security services of IPv4**. IPv4 was designed in an era, i.e. the 1970s, when the Internet was primarily used among mutually-trusted networking researchers

$\to$ Creating a computer network integrating a multitude of link-layer technologies was already challenging enough, without having to worry about security
* *Problem*. Security is a major concern today, thus Internet researchers have moved on to design new network-layer protocols providing a variety of security services
    * *Example of network-protocol security service*. IPsec, VPNs, etc.

# Appendix
## Concepts
**How CIDRized addresses facilitate routing**. Consider the figure below

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/g6VEs3o.png">
    <figcaption>ISPs-R-Us has more specific route to organization 1</figcaption>
</div>

* *Address aggregation*. The ability to use a single prefix to advertise multiple networks
    * *Other names*. Route aggregation, or route summarization
    * *Example*. the ISP, which we call fly-by-night-ISP advertises to the outside world that it should be sent any datagrams, whose first 20 address bits match `200.23.16.0/20`

        $\to$ The rest of the world need not know that within the address block `200.23.16.0/20`, there are, in fact, eight other organizations, each with its own subnets
* *Usage*. TheAddress aggregation works extremely well when addresses are allocated in blocks to ISPs, and then from ISPs to client organizations
* *Problem*. When addresses are not allocated in such a hierarchical manner, e.g. when fly-by-night-ISP acquires ISPs-R-Us then has organization 1 connect to the Internet via its subsidiary ISPs-R-Us
    
    $\to$ The subsidiary ISPs-R-Us owns the address block `199.31.0.0/16`, but organization 1's aIP addresses are outsidew of this address block
    * *Solution 1*. Organization renumbers all of its routers and hosts to have addresses within the ISPs-R-Us address block
        * *Drawback*. This is a costly solution, and organization 1 may well be reassigned to another subsidiary in the future
    * *Solution 2*. Organization 1 keeps its IP addresses in `200.23.18.0/23`, and ISPs-R-Us now also advertise the block of addresses for organization 1, i.e. `200.23.18.0/23`
        
        $\to$ When other routers in the larger Internet see the address blocks `200.23.16.0/20` and `200.23.18.0/20`, and want to route to an address in the block, they will use longest prefix matching

**Classful networks**. Let `n` indicates a bit used for network ID, `H` indicates a bit used for host ID, and `X` indicates a bit without a special purpose

```python
Class A
  0.  0.  0.  0 = 00000000.00000000.00000000.00000000
127.255.255.255 = 01111111.11111111.11111111.11111111
                  0nnnnnnn.HHHHHHHH.HHHHHHHH.HHHHHHHH

Class B

191.255.255.255 = 10111111.11111111.11111111.11111111
                  10nnnnnn.nnnnnnnn.HHHHHHHH.HHHHHHHH

Class C

223.255.255.255 = 11011111.11111111.11111111.11111111
                  110nnnnn.nnnnnnnn.nnnnnnnn.HHHHHHHH

Class D # reserved for multicast, and cannot be used for regular unicast traffic
224.  0.  0.  0 = 11100000.00000000.00000000.00000000
239.255.255.255 = 11101111.11111111.11111111.11111111
                  1110XXXX.XXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXX

Class E # reserved and cannot be used on the public Internet
240.  0.  0.  0 = 11110000.00000000.00000000.00000000
255.255.255.255 = 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111
                  1111XXXX.XXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXX
```

**List of reserved address blocks**.
* *History*. Originally IPv4 addresses were broken into classes, with the upper bits of the first octet indicated the network class, which implied how specific address should be split into a network and host portion

    $\to$ These bits dictated how the address should be interpreted by routers
    * *Classes of networks*. A, B, and C, i.e. blocks of addresses to accommodate networks of different sizes
    * *Address exhaustion*. Every IP address has to be globally unique across the whole Internet

        $\to$ Address blocks had to be assigned to end user networks to be locally managed
        * *Consequence*. IP address space for the public Internet gets handed out by the IANA
    * *Special use addresses*.
        * *Loopback interfaces*. 
            * *Purposes*.
                * Created on hosts to assure that there was a place for IP traffic to go, even if all interfaces were down
                * To be able to test IP traffic, without any worries about hardware or driver issues associated with a network interface
                    * *Explain*. Debugging any network requires two end points, i.e. the sender and the receiver
            * *Chosen address*. The last of the class A networks, i.e. `127.0.0.0/8`
                * *Original code of 4.1a BSD UNIX*.

                    ```cpp
                    #define	LONET	127 
                    #define	LOHOST	1	/* can't be 0, that's broadcast */ 
                    #define	LOMTU	(1024+512) 
                    ```
                * *Explain*. At that time, the predecessor to the Internet, i.e. ARPANET, had not even grown enough, even to start using the class B space

                    $\to$ The founders of the Internet had not yet imagined how big the network would be, and assign the last class A block probably seemed logical and convenient
            * *Consequence*. This is a wasteful choice, but who knew at the time?

                $\to$ Since the upper bits were easy to check, convenience ruled the day over long-term vision
        * *`10.0.0.0/8` network*. Originally assigned to MILNET and the Defense data network (DDN)

            $\to$ A lot of early Internet devices had `10.x.x.x` networks hardcoded into the software
            * *Consequence*. In the mid-1990s, those networks were shut down, and moved into other forms, but the `10.x.x.x` space was considered poisoned due to hardcoding

                $\to$ To avoid trouble, the network would never be assigned on the public Internet again
        * *Private networks*. As IPv4 address exhaustion took hold, a need for non-routable addresses for private networks arose
            
            $\to$ At first, people picked random IP address spaces, but then they ran the risk of failing to reach any network, which their chosen space overlapped with
            * *Consequence*. RFC 1597 proposed reserving a number of specific IP networks for use as private networks
                * *Class A*. Use the poisoned `10.x.x.x` space
                * *Class B and C*. The next available unassigned blocks at that time of the RFC authoring were assigned by Jon Postel
        * *`1.x.x.x` and `2.x.x.x` space*. Very problematic, since lots of people had reflexively used that space for testing without coordination

            $\to$ It had been left as a reserved space from nearly the beginning of IPv4

    * *Reference*. https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-history-behind-192-168-1-1-Why-not-192-169-1-1-or-any-other-IP-address-When-did-it-start-being-used-Who-started-it-Why-Why-not-1-1-1-1-What-is-the-relation-to-127-0-0-1-What-about-10-0-0-1-Apple/answer/Phillip-Remaker
* *Private address ranges*.
    * *Classes of addresses*. IANA has assigned several address ranges to be used by private networks
        * *Class A*. `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255`
        * *Class B*. `172.16.0.0` to `172.31.255.255`
        * *Class C*. `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255`
    * *Main difference between classes*. How many hosts and subnets can be supported
    * *Usage*.
        * `192.168.0.0/16` are generally used by ISPs for customer's LANs
        * `10.0.0.0/8` are generally used for infrastructure, including VPN tunnels, and enterprise networks
* *List of other `/8` blocks reserved IPv4 address*. Some large `/8` blocks of IPv4 addresses, i.e. the former class A network blocks, are assigned in whole to single organizations, or related groups of organizations, either by ICANN or IANA, or a regional registry
    * *`0.0.0.0/8`*. For local identification
    * *`127.0.0.0/8`*. For loopback, i.e. any packet sent to any of the addresses in this block is looped back
        * *`127.0.0.1`*. Standard address for IPv4 loopback traffic, i.e. this is actually `localhost`
        * *Other addresses*. Not supported by all OSes, however, they can be used to set up multiple server applications on the host
            * *Explain*. All these addresses are binded to interface `lo`, and depending on the OS, they are the same or not
    * *`224.0.0.0/8` to `239.0.0.0/8`*. For multicast
    * *`240.0.0.0/8` to `255.0.0.0/8`*. For future use
* *Reference*. https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml

**First and last subnet addresses IP address**. In general, the first and last addresses in a subnet are used as the network identifier and broadcast address, respectively

$\to$ All other addresses in the subnet can be assigned to hosts on that subnet
