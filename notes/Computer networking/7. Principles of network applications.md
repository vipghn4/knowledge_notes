# Principles of network applications
**The core of network application development**. Write programs which run on different end systems and communicate with each other over the network

$\to$ When developing a new application, we need to write software which will run on muliple end systems

    <figcaption>Communication for a network application takes place between end systems at the application layer</figcaption>
</div>

>**NOTE**. We do not need to write software which runs on network core devices, e.g. routers or link-layer switches

>**NOTE**. Even if we wanted to write application software for these network-core devices, we wouldn't be able to do so

## Network application architectures
**Network archtiecture and application architecture**.
* *Application developer's perspective about network architecture*. The network architecture is fixed and provides a specific set of services to applications
* *Application architecture*. Designed by the application developer and dictate how the application is structured over the various end systems
    * *Predominant architectural paradigms in modern network*. Client-server architecture and peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture

        <div style="text-align:center">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/i8eGqnz.png">
            <figcaption>Client-server architecture and P2P architecture</figcaption>
        </div>

**Client-server architecture**. An always-on host, i.e. server, which services requests from many other hosts, i.e. clients
* *Idea*. When the server receives a request for an object from a client host, it responds by sending the requested object to the client host
    * *Example*. Web, FTP, Telnet, e-mail
* *Characteristics*.
    * *Client-client communication*. Within this architecture, clients do not directly communicate with each other
    * *Server address*. The server has a fixed, well-known address, i.e. IP address

        $\to$ Client can always contact the server by sending a packet to the server's IP address
* *Server workload*. A single-server host is incapable of keeping up with all the requests from clients
    * *Data center*. For the reason above, a data center, housing a large number of hosts, is often used to create a powerful virtual server
    * *Number of servers in a data center*. Hundreds of thousands of servers, which must be powered and maintained
    * *Pricing*. The service providers must pay recurring interconnection and bandwidth costs for sending data from their data centers

**P2P architecture**. There is minimal (or no) reliance on dedicated servers in data centers

$\to$ The application exploits direct communication between pairs of intermittently connected hosts, i.e. peers
* *Peers*. Not owned by the service provider, but instead desktops and laptops controlled by users, with most of the peers residing in homes, universities, and offices
* *Usage*. In today's most popular and traffic-intensive applications
    * *Example*. File sharing, e.g. BitTorrent, peer-assisted download acceleration, e.g. Xunlei, Internet Telephony, e.g. Skype, etc.

    >**NOTE**. Some applications have hybrid architectures, combining client-server and P2P elements
* *Characteristics*.
    * *Self-scalability*. One of the most compelling features of P2P architectures
    * *Cost efficiency*. P2P architectures are cost effective, since they normally do not require significant server infrastructure and server bandwidth
* *Drawbacks*.
    * *ISP friendly*. Most residential ISPs, including DSL and cable ISPs, have been dimensioned for asymmetrical bandwidth usage
        * *Asymmetrical bandwidth usage*. The downstream traffic is much more than upstream traffic
        * *Problem with P2P*. P2P video streaming and file distribution applications shift upstream traffic from servers to residential ISPs

            $\to$ This puts significant strerss on the ISPs
    * *Security*. Because of their highly distributed and open nature, P2P applications can b e challenge to secure
    * *Incentives*. The success of future P2P applications also depends on convincing users to volunteer bandwidth, storage, and computation resources to the applications

        $\to$ This is the challenge of incentive design

## Processes communicating
**Processes**. A program running within an end system
* *Process communication between end systems*. By exchanging messages across the computer network
    * *Idea*. 
        * A sending process creates and sends messages into the network
        * A receiving process receives the messages and possibly responds by sending messages back

### Client and server processes
**Client and server processes**. For each pair of communication processes, we typically label one or two processes as the client and the other proces as server

>**NOTE**. A process in a P2P network can be both a client and a server

**Client and server processes in the context of a communciation session between a process pair**.
* *Client*. The process initiating the communication
* *Server*. The process waiting to be contacted to begin the session

>**NOTE**. We sometimes also use the terminology "client side and server side of an application"

### The interface between the process and the computer network
**Socket**. A process sends messages into, and receives messages from, the network through a software interface called a *socket*
* *Human analogy*. When a process wants to send a message to another process on another host
    1. It shoves the message out its door (socket)
    2. A transportation infrastructure on the other side of its door will transport the message to the door of the destination process
    3. Once the message arrives at the destination host, the messages passes through the receiving process' door (socket)
    4. The receiving then acts on the message

**Socket communication between two communicating processes**.

    <figcaption>Application processes, sockets, and underlying transport protocol</figcaption>
</div>

* *Application programming interface (API)*. A socket is the interface (API) between the application layer and the transport layer within a host
    * *Explain*. The socket is the programming interface, with which network applications are built

        $\to$ The developer has control of everything on the application-layer side of the socket, but has little control of the transport-layer side of the socket
    * *Developer's control on transport-layer side of a socket*.
        * The choice of transport protocol
        * The ability to fix a few transport-layer parameters, e.g. maximum buffer, maximum segment sizes, etc.

### Addressing processes
**Problem**. For a process running on one host to send packets to process running on another host

$\to$ The receiving process needs to have an address
* *Identifying the receiving process*. Require two types of information
    * The address of the host
    * The identifier which specifies the receiving process in the destination host
* *Host address*. Identified by IP address, i.e. a 32-bit quantity which uniquely identifies the host
* *Port number*. The identification of the receiving socket
    * *Port number for popular applications*. Popular applications have been assigned specific port numbers, e.g. Web server is port 80, mail server is port 25

## Transport services available to applications
**Transport-layer protocols**. There are more than one transport-layer protocol

$\to$ How can we make this choice?
* *Idea*. 
    1. Study the services provided by the available transport-layer protocols
    2. Pick the protocol with the services which best match our application's needs
* *Criterias for choosing transport-layer protocols*.
    * Reliable data transfer
    * Throughput
    * Timing
    * Security

### Reliable data transfer
**Reliable data transfer**. A protocol provides reliable data transfer if it does something to guarantee that the data sent by one end of the application is delivered correctly and completely to the other end of the application
* *Explain*. There can be data loss due to buffer overflow in a router, or corrupted data
* *Process-to-process reliable data transfer*. An important service potentially provided by a transport-layer protocol 
    * *Explain*. The sending process can just pass its data into the socket and know with complete confidence that the data will arrive without errors at the receiving process

**Loss-tolerant applications**. Applications which accept some of the data sent by the sending process may never arrive at the receiving process
* *Example*. Multimedia applications

### Throughput
**Problem**. Other sessions will be sharing the bandwidth along the network path, and these sessions will be coming and going

$\to$ The available throughput can fluctuate with time
* *Consequence*. There should be a natural service provided by a transport-layer protocol, which guaranteed available throughput at some speicfied rate

    $\to$ The application could request a guaranteed throughput of $r$ bits/sec, and the transport protocol would ensure that the available throughput is always at least $r$ bits/src
* *Over-requesting for bandwidth*. If the transport protocol cannot provide the requested throughput

    $\to$ The application would need to encode at a lower rate, or may have to give up

**Bandwidth-sensitive applications**. Applications which may have throughput requirements
* *Example*. Telephony applications, multimedia applications, etc.

**Elastic applications**. Applications which can make use of as much, or as little, throughput as happens to be available
* *Example*. Electronic mail, file transfer, and Web transfers

### Timing
**Timing guarantees**. 
* *Example*. Every bit pumped into the socket by the sender should arrive at the receiver's socket no more than 100 msec later

    $\to$ This requirements are usually from interactive real-time applications, e.g. Internet telephony, virtual environments, teleconferencing, etc.

### Security
**Security**. A transport protocol can provide an application with one or more security services
* *Idea*. 
    * In the sending host, a transport protocol can encrypt all data transmitted by the sending process
    * In the receiving host, the transport-layer protocol can decrypt the data before delivering the data to the receiving process
* *Other security services*. Data integrity, end-point authentication, etc.

## Transport services provided by the Internet
**Transport protocols provided by the Internet to applications**. TCP and UDP

### TCP services
**TCP service model**. Include a connection-oriented service and a reliable data transfer service
* *Connection-oriented service*. 
    * *Handshaking procedure*. TCP has the client and server exchange transport-layer control information with each other, before the application-level messages begin to flow
    * *Purpose*. Allow the client and server to prepare for an onslaught of packets

        $\to$ After the handshaking phase, a TCP connection is said to exist between the sockets of the two processes
    * *Full-duplex connection*. The TCP connection is a full-duplex connection, i.e. two processes can send messages to each other over the connection at the same time
    * *Connection tear-down*. After the application finishes sending messages, it must tear down the connection
* *Reliable data transfer service*. The communicating process can rely on TCP to deliver all data sent without error and in the proper order
    * *Explain*. When one side of the application passes a stream of bytes into a socket

        $\to$ It can count on TCP to deliver the same stream of bytes to the receiving socket, with no missing or duplicate bytes

**Congestion-control mechanism**. A service included in TCP for general welfare of the Internet, rather than for the direct benefit of the communicating processes
* *Idea*. Throttle a sending process when the network is congested between sender and receiver

**Securing TCP**. Neither TCP nor UDP provide an encryption, i..e the data passed into the sender's socket is the same data traveling over the network to the destination process

$\to$ Due to privacy and security issues, the Internet community has developed an enhancement of TCP, called Secure sockets layer (SSL)
* *TCP-enhanced-with-SSL*. Do everything which traditional TCP does, and provide critical process-to-process security services, i.e. encryption, data integrity, and end-point authentication

    >**NOTE**. SSL is not a third Internet transport protocol, but an enhancement of TCP, with the enhancement implemented in the application layer

* *Using SSL in applications*. If an application wants to use the services of SSL, it needs to include SSL code (existing, highly optimized libraries and classes) in both the client and server sides of the application
    * *SSL socket API*. Similar to the traditional TCP socket API
    * *Functionality of SSL*. When an application uses SSL
        1. The sending process passes cleartext data to the SSL socket
        2. The SSL in the sending host encrypts the data and passes the encrypted data to the TCP socket
        3. The encrypted data travels over the Internet to the TCP dsocket in the receiving processes
        4. The receiving socket passes the encryped data to SSL, which decrypts the data
        5. The SSL passes the cleartext data through its SSL socket to the receiving process

### UDP services
**UDP**. A no-frills, lightweight transport protocol, providing minimal services
* *Connectionlessness*. UDP is connectionless, i.e. there is no handshaking before the two processes start to communicate
* *Unreliabe data transfer*. UDP provides an unreliable data transfer serivce, i.e. when a process sends a message into a UDP socket
    
    $\to$ UDP provides no guarantee that the message will ever reach the receiving process
* *Message order*. Messages arriving at the receiving process may arrive out of order

**Congestion-control mechanism**. UDP does not include a congestion-control mechanism

$\to$ The sending side of UDP can pump data into the layer below (the layer layer) at any rate it pleases

### Services not provided by Internet transport protocols
**Services not provided by the Internet transport protocols**. Timing and throughput guarantees
* *Guaranteeing timing requirements*. Applications must be designed to cope, to the greatest extent possible, with the lack of guarantee from the Internet protocols
* *Guaranteeing throughput requirements*. Clever design has its limitations when delay is excessive, i.e. the end-to-end throughput is limited

    $\to$ Today's Internet can often provide satisfactory service to time-sensitive applications, but cannot provide any timing or throughput guarantees

## Application-layer protocols
**Application-layer protocol**. Define how an application's processes, running on different end systems, pass messages to each other
* *Things defined by application-layer protocol*.
    * The types of messages exchanged, e.g. request messages and response messages
    * The syntax of the various message types, e.g. fields in the message and how the fields are delineated
    * The semantics of the fields, i.e. the meaning of the information in the fields
    * Rules for determining when and how a process sends messages and responds to messages
* *Detail references*. RFC documentations

**Network applications and application-layer protocols**. Application-layer protocol is only once piece of a network application

# Appendix
## Case study
### Bitcoin P2P network
**Bitcoin peer nodes**.
* *Full nodes*. Download and verify every blocks and transaction prior to relaying them to other nodes
* *Archival nodes*. Full nodes which store the entire blockchain and can serve historical blocks to other nodes
* *Pruned nodes*. Full nodes which do not store the entire blockchain

**Network and protocols**. Consensus rules do not cover networking, thus Bitcoin programs may use alternative networks and protocols

**Peer discovery**. Joining peers query one or more DNS names, i.e. DNS seeds, hardcoded into Bitcoin Core and BitcoinJ, to discover some IP addresses

$\to$ The response to the lookup should include one or more DNS A record, with the IP addresses of full nodes which may accept new incoming connections
* *DNS seeds*. Maintained by Bitcoin community members
    * *Dynamic seeds*. Some members provide dynmaic DNS seed servers which automatically get IP addresses of active nodes by scanning the network
    * *Static seeds*. Some members provide static DNS seeds which are updated manually and are more likely to provide IP addresses for inactive nodes
* *Security*. DNS seed results are not authenticated and a malicious seed operator, or network main-in-the-middle attacker, can return only IP addresses of nodes controlled by the attacker

    $\to$ Programs should not rely on DNS seeds exclusively

## Concepts
**Incentive-centered design (ICD)**. The science of designing a system according to the alignment of individual and user incentives with the goals of the system

**Finding peers in a P2P network**. Finding a peer in a P2P network is done via the peer routing tables
* *Finding peers procedure*.
    1. Find closest peer (GUID) to target peer (GUID) in our own routing table
    2. If closest peer is not target peer, contact closest peer and ask for closest peer to target peer
    3. If closest peer returned from the contacted peer is not target peer, repeat from 2

**Booting and joining a P2P network**. 
* *P2P network initialization*. The network starts with a single peer, i.e. the boot peer
    * *Booting the network*. When the boot peer is running, joining peer can join the work, so the peers can get connected
    * *Boot process*. Consist of a lot of joining peers which join the network via the boot peer
    * *Join process*.
        1. Joining peer sends a `JOIN` request to the boot peer, and gets a GUID back
        2. Joining peer sends a `COPY_ROUTING_TABLE` to the boot peer
        3. Joining peer finds the correct peers it should have in its own routing table
* *Finding the correct peers for the routing table*. A peer should keep other peers in its routing table, which are closest to certain GUID distances, e.g. 1, 2, 4, 8, etc., from its own GUID

    $\to$ The routing table recevied from the boot peer will thus be correct for the boot peer's GUID, but not the joining peer

    >**NOTE**. If the joininig peer is the first peer in the network after the boot peer
    >$\to$ The routing table it receives from the boot peer will only contain the joining peers GUID, thus finding process is skipped
* *Reference*. http://tutorials.jenkov.com/p2p/peer-routing-table.html

**Leaving a P2P network**. When a peer wants to leave a P2P network, it sends a `LEAVE` request to all peers in its routing table

$\to$ Each of these peers can remove the leaving peer from their routing table
* *Choord and Kademlia*. There is a difference in what peers that a Choord or a Kademlia network would keep in its routing table  
    * *Kademlia network*. Each peer reference in the routing tables goes both ways
        * *Explain*. If A has B in its routing table, then B also has A in its routing table

            $\to$ All peers in A's routing table should be notified of A's leaving
    * *Choord network*. If A has B in its routing table, B does not necessarily have A in its routing table

        $\to$ If A leaves a Choord network, it would have to find peers in the network having it in the routing table
        * *Idea*. Find those peers having distances closest to A

**Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP)**. The set of communication protocols used in the Internet and similar computer networks
* *Foundation protocols in the suit*. Transmission control protocol (TCP) and Internet protocol (IP)
