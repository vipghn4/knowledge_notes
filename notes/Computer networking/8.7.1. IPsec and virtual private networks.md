# Network-layer security - IPsec and virtual private networks
**IP security protocol**. Commonly known as IPsec, provides security at the network layer
* *IPsec*. Secure IP datagrams between two network-layer entities, including hosts and routers
* *IPsec and VPN*. Many institutions use IPsec to create VPNs running over the public Internet domain

**Confidentiality at the network layer**.
* *Idea*. With network-layer confidentiality between a pair of network entities, e.g. two routers
    
    $\to$ The sending entity encrypts the payloads of all the datagrams it sends to the receiving entity
    * *The encrypted payload*. Could be a TCP segment, a UDP segment, an ICMP message, etc.
* *Consequence*. If such a network-layer service were in place, all data sent from one entity to the other would be hidden any third party which might by sniffing the network

    $\to$ Network-security is said to provide blanket coverage

**Other security services provided by a network-layer security protocol**. 
* Source authentication, i.e. the receiving entity can verify the source of the secured datagram
* Data integrity, i.e. the receiving entity can check for any tampering of the datagram, which may have occurred while the datagram was in transit
* Replay-attack prevention, i.e. the receiver could detect any duplicate datagrams which an attacker might insert

## IPsec and virtual private networks
**Problem**. An institution extending over multiple geographical regions often desires its own IP network

$\to$ This allows the hosts and servers of the institution to send data to each other, in a secure and confidential manner
* *Solution 1*. The institution actually deploy a stand-alone physical network, including routers, links, and a DNS infrastructure, which is completely separate from the public Internet
    * *Private network*. Such a disjoint network described above, dedicated to a particular institution
    * *Drawback*. A private network can be very costly, since the institution needs to purchase, install, and maintain its own physical network infrastructure
* *Solution 2*. Create VPNs over the existing public Internet

    $\to$ With a VPN, the institution's inter-office traffic is sent over the public Internet rather than over a physically independent network
    * *Confidentiality*. To provide confidentiality, the inter-office traffic is encrypted before it enters the public Internet

**VPN example**.

* *Data transmission*. When a host in headquarters sends an IP datagram to a salesperson in ahotel
    1. The gateway router in headquarters converts the vanilla IPv4 datagram into an IPsec datagram
    2. The gateway router then forwards this IPsec datagram into the Internet
    3. This IPsec datagram actually has a traditional IPv4 header, thus the routers in the public Internet process the datagram as if it were an ordinary IPv4 datagram
    4. When the IPsec datagram arrives at the salesperson's laptop, the OS in the laptop decrypts the payload, and provides other security services, e.g. verifying data integrity
    5. The OS in the laptop passes en unencrypted payload to the upper-layer protocol, e.g. TCP or UDP

## The AH and ESP protocols
>**NOTE**. IPsec is a very complex entity, which is defined in more than a dozen RFCs

**Principal protocols in IPsec protocol suite**. Authentication header (AH) protocol, and Encapsulation security payload (ESP) protocol

$\to$ When a source IPsec entity, e.g. a host or a router, sends secure datagrams to a destination entity, e.g. a host or a router, it uses either AH or ESP protocols
* *AH protocol*. Provide source authentication and data integrity, but does not provide confidentiality
* *ESP protocol*. Provide source authentication, data integrity, and confidentiality

    $\to$ ESP protocol is much more widely used than the AH protocol, since confidentiality is often critical for VPNs and other IPsec applications

## Security associations
**Security associations (SAs)**. Before sending IPsec datagrams from source entity to destination entity, the source and destination entities create a network-layer logical connection
* *Security association (SA)*. The created logical connection, which is a simplex logical connection
* *Simplex connection*. An unidirectional connection, from source to destination

    $\to$ If both entities want to send secure datagrams to each other, then two SAs need to be established, one in each direction

>**NOTE**. Not all traffic sent to the Internet by the gateway routers, or by the laptops, will be IPsec secured
>* *Example*. A host behind the gateway router may want to access a Web server, e.g. Amazon or Google, in the public Internet

**SA structure**. Suppose that there is an SA from router R1 to router R2

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/uGXtXAB.png">
    <figcaption>Security association (SA) from R1 to R2</figcaption>
</div>

* *SA state*. Maintained by router R1, which include
    * A 32-bit identifier for the SA, i.e. the security parameter index (SPI)
    * The origin interface of the SA, e.g. `200.168.1.100`, and the destination interface of the SA, e.g. `193.68.2.23`
    * The type of encryption to be used, e.g. 3DES with CBC
    * The encryption key
    * The type of integrity check, e.g. HMAC with MD5
    * The authentication key
* *IPsec datagram in R1*. When R1 needs to construct an IPsec datagram for forwarding over the SA

    $\to$ It accesses the SA state information to determine how it should authenticate and encrypt the datagram
* *IPsec datagram in R2*. R2 will maintain the same SA state and will use this information to authenticate and decrypt any IPsec datagram arriving from the SA

**Security association database (SAD)**. An IPsec entity, e.g. router or host, often maintains state information for many SAs

$\to$ An IPsec entity storing the state information for all of its SA in its SAD, which is a data structure in the entity's OS kernel

## The IPsec datagram
**Packet forms of IPsec**.
* *Tunnel mode*. This mode is more appropriate for VPNs, which is more widely deployed than the transport mode
* *Transport mode*

**IPsec datagram format for tunnel mode**. Used to convert the original IPv4 datagram into an IPsec datagram (at a router or host) for transmission purposes

<div style="text-align:center">

    <figcaption>IPsec datagram format for tunnel mode</figcaption>
</div>

* *IPv4-to-IPsec-datagram conversion procedure*.
    1. Append to the back of the original IPv4 datagram, which includes the original header fields, an ESP trailer field
    2. Encrypt the result using the algorithm and key specified by the SA
    3. Append to the front of this encrypted quantity a field called *ESP header*

        $\to$ The resulting package is called the *enchilada*
    4. Create an authentication MAC over the whole enchilada using the algorithm and key specified in the SA
    5. Append the MAC to the back of the enchilada forming the payload
    6. Create a brand new IP header, with all the classic IPv4 header fields, then appends before the payload

        $\to$ The resulting package is called a *bona fide IPv4 datagram*
* *Source and destination IP address*. The IPsec datagram includes the original IP datagram, which includes the original IP addresses for source and destination
    * *Question*. What is the source and destination IP addresses in the new IP header
    * *Answer*. The source and destination IP addresses in the new IP header point to the source and destination router interfaces at the two ends of the tunnels, i.e. R1 and R2's interfaces
* *Protocol number in the new IPv4 header*. Set to 50, i.e. designate that this is an IPsec datagram using the ESP protocol

**IPsec datagram traversal**. After R1 sends the IPsec datagram into the public Internet, it will pass though many routers before reaching R2

$\to$ Each of these routers will process the datagram as if it were an ordinary datagram

**Detail structure of the enchilada**.
* *ESP trailer*. Consist of three fields, i.e. padding, pad length, and next header
    * *Motivation*. Block ciphers require the message to be encrypted to be an integer multiple of the block length
    * *Padding*. Consist of meaningless bytes, which are used to satisfy the requirements of block ciphers
    * *Pad length*. Indicate to the receiving entity how much padding was inserted
    * *Next header*. Identify the type, e.g. UDP, of data contained in the payload-data field
* *ESP header*. Sent in the clear and consist of two fields
    * *SPI*. Indicate to the receiving entity the SA, to which the datagram belongs
        
        $\to$ The receiving entity can index its SAD with the SPI to determine the appropriate authentication/decryption algorithms and keys
    * *Sequence number*. Used to defend against replay attacks
* *Authentication MAC*. Used to check data integrity

**Receiving IPsec at R2**. When R2 receives the IPsec datagram, it observes that the destination IP address of the datagram is R2

$\to$ R2 then processes the datagram
1. Since the protocol field in the left-most IP header is 50, R2 sees that it should apply IPsec ESP processing to the datagram
2. Peering into the enchilada, R2 uses the SPI to determine to which SA the datagram belongs
3. R2 calculates the MAC of the enchilada and verifies that the MAC is consistent with the value in the ESP MAC field
4. If it is, R2 knows that the enchilada comes from R1, and has not been tampered with
5. R2 checks the sequence number field to verify that the datagram is fresh, and not a replayed one
6. R2 decrypts the encrypted unit using the decryption algorithm and key associated with the SA
7. R2 removes padding and extract the original, vanilla IP datagram
8. R2 forwards the original datagram into the destination host

**Security policy database (SPD)**. When R1 receives an unsecured datagram from a host in the headquarters network, and the datagram is destined to some destination IP address outside the headquarters
* *Questions*.
    * How does R1 know whether it should be converted to an IPsec datagram
    * If the datagram is to be processed by IPsec, then which SA should be used
* *SPD*. Along with a SAD, the IPsec entity also maintains a SPD
    * What types of datagrams, as a function of source IP address, destination IP address, and protocol type, are to be IPsec processed
    * For those which are to be IPsec processed, then which SA should be used

## IKE - Key management in IPsec
**Entering SA information**. 
* *Problem*. When a VPN has a small number of end points

    $\to$ The network administrator can manually enter the SA information into the SADs of the endpoints

    >**NOTE**. This is impractical for a large VPN, which may consist of hundreds or even thousands of IPsec routers and hosts

* *Solution*. Use Internet key Exchange (IKE) protocol, as specified in RFC 5996, for automated mechanism for creating the SAs

**IKE and SSL**. IKE has some similarities with the handshake in SSL
* *Explain*. Each IPsec entity has a certificate, which includes the entity's public key

    $\to$ As with SSL, the IDK protocol has the two entities exchange certificates, negotiate authentication and encryption algorithms, and securely exchange key material for creating session keys in the IPsec SAs
* *Difference from SSL*. IKE employes two phases to carry out these tasks

**Two phases of IKE**. Consider the context of two routers R1 and R2
* *First phase*.
    1. The two sides use Diffie-Hellman to create a bi-directional IKE SA between the routers
    2. The IKE SA provides an authenticated and encrypted channel between the routers
        * *Key establishment*. During this first message-pair exchange, keys are established for encryption and authentication for the IKE SA
        * *Master secret establishment*. A master secret used to compute IPsec SA keys for phase 2 is also established
    
    >**NOTE**. RSA public and private keys are not used in this phase
    >$\to$ Neither R1 nor R2 reveals its identity by signing a message with its private key

* *Second phase*. 
    1. Both sides reveal their identity to each other by signing their messages
        
        >**NOTE**. The identities are not revealed to a passive sniffer, since the messages are sent over the secured IKE SA channel

    2. Both sides negotiate the IPsec encryption and authentication algorithms to be employed by the IPsec SAs
    3. Both sides create an SA in each direction
    4. The encryption and authentication session keys are established on both sides for the two SAs

        $\to$ The two sides can then use the SAs to send secured datagrams

**Motivation for two-phases IKE**. Due to computational cost, i.e. the second phase does not involve any public-key cryptography

$\to$ IKE can generate a large number of SAs between the two IPsec entities, with relatively little computational cost

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Payload (networking)**. When a transmission unit is sent from the source to the destination, it contains both a header and the actual data being transmitted

$\to$ The actual data is called the payload

**Network interface**. A point of interconnection between a computer and a private or public network

$\to$ This is generally a network interface card (NIC) without a physical form
* *Example*. `127.0.0.1` for IPv2 and `::1` for IPv6

**Interface (network layer)**.
* *Host interface*. A host typically has only a single link into the networking interface
    
    $\to$ When IP in the host wants to send a datagram, it does so over this link
    * *Interface*. The boundary between the host and the physical link
* *Router interfaces*. A router may have two or more links connected to it
    * *Interface*. The boundary between the router and any of its link

        $\to$ A router thus has multiple interfaces, one for each of its link
