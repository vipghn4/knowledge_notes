# Broadcast and multicast routing
**Brief**. Lately, we focus on routing protocols for unicast, i.e. point-to-point, communication

$\to$ We now turn attention to broadcast and multicast routing protocols
* *Broadcast routing*. The network layer provides a service of delivering a packet sent from a source node to all other nodes in the network
* *Multicast routing*. Enable a single source node to send a copy of a packet to a subset of the other network nodes

## Broadcast routing algorithms
**Most straightforward way to accomplish broadcast communication**. The sending node to send a separate copy of the packet to each destination
* *Idea*. Given $N$ destination nodes
    1. The source node makes $N$ copies of the packet, addressing each copy to a different destination
    2. The source node transmits the $N$ copies to the $N$ destinations using unicast routing
* *Pros and cons*.
    * *Pros*. Simple, i.e. no new network-layer routing protocol, packet-duplication, or forwarding functionality is needed
    * *Cons*. 
        * Inefficiency, i.e. if the source node is connected to the rest of the network via a single link
            
            $\to$ $N$ separate copies of the same packet will traverse this single link
            * *Improvement*. Send only a single copy of a packet over this first hop
                
                $\to$ The node at the other end of the first hop will make and forward any additional needed copies
            * *Conclusion*. It would be more efficient for the network nodes themselves to create duplicate copies of a packet
        * An implicit assumption of $N$-way-unicast is that broadcast recipients, and their addresses, are known to the sender
            
            $\to$ This cannot be easily obtained
            * *Explain*. Most likely, additional protocol mechanisms, e.g. a broadcast membership or destination-registration protocol, would be required
                
                $\to$ This would add more overhead complexity to a protocol, which had initially seemed quite simple
        * The purposes for which broadcast is to be used, i.e. link-state routing protocols use broadcast to disseminate the link-state information used to compute unicast routes
            * *Consequence*. If broadcast is used to create and update unicast routes
                
                $\to$ It would be unwise, at best, to rely on the unicast routing infrastructure to achieve broadcast

**Most recent approaches**. Approaches, in which the network nodes play an active role in packet duplication, packet forwarding, and computation of the broadcast routes
* *Network graph*. The network is modeled as a graph, $G = (N,E)$, where
    * $N$ is a set of nodes and a collection $E$ of edges
    * Each edge is a pair of nodes from $N$

### Uncontrolled flooding
**Uncontrolled flooding**. The most obvious technique for achieving broadcast
* *Idea*.
    1. The source node sends a copy of the packet to all of its neighbors
    2. When a node receives a broadcast packet, it duplicates the packet and forwards it to all of its neighbors, except the neighbor from which it received the packet
* *Correctness*. If the graph is connected, this scheme will eventually deliver a copy of the broadcast packet to all nodes in the graph 
* *Pros*. Simple and elegant
* *Cons*. 
    * If the graph has cycles, then one or more copies of each broadcast packet will cycle indefinitely
    * When a node is connected to more than two other nodes, it will create and forward multiple copies of the broadcast packet
        
        $\to$ Each copy will create multiple copies of itself, at other nodes with more than two neighbors
        * *Consequence*. This broadcast storm, resulting from the endless multiplication of broadcast packets, would eventually result in so many broadcast packets being created that the network would be rendered useless

### Controlled flooding
**Key to avoiding a broadcast storm**. A node must judiciously choose when to flood a packet and when not to flood a packet

$\to$ In practice, this can be done in one of several ways

**Sequence-number-controlled flooding**. Used in the Gnutella protocol to broadcast queries in its overlay network
1. A source node puts its address, or other unique identifier, and a broadcast sequence number into a broadcast packet
2. The source node sends the packet to all of its neighbors
3. Each neighbor node maintains a list of the source address and sequence number of each broadcast packet it already received, duplicated, and forwarded
4. When a node receives a broadcast packet, it checks whether the packet is in this list
    * If so, the packet is dropped
    * If not, the packet is duplicated and forwarded to all the node’s neighbors, except the node, from which the packet has just been received

**Reverse path forwarding (RPF) (or reverse path broadcast (RPB))**. 
* *Idea*. When a router receives a broadcast packet with a given source address
   * If the packet arrived on the link, which is on the router's shortest unicast path back to the source

       $\to$ It transmits the packet on all of its outgoing links, except the one on which it was received
   * Otherwise, the router discards the incoming packet without forwarding it on any of its outgoing links
       * *Explain*. The router knows it either will receive, or has already received, a copy of this packet on the link, which is on its own shortest path back to the sender
* *Requirements for functionality*. RPF need only know the next neighbor on its unicast shortest path to the sender
   
   $\to$ It uses this neighbor’s identity only to determine whether or not to flood a received broadcast packet, i.e.
   * RPF does not use unicast routing to actually deliver a packet to a destination
   * RPF does not require that a router know the complete shortest path from itself to the source

### Spanning-tree broadcast
**Brief**. While sequence-number-controlled flooding and RPF avoid broadcast storms

$\to$ They do not completely avoid the transmission of redundant broadcast packets
* *Example*. Consider the following network

    <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ikwAEpu.png">
        <figcaption>Reverse path forwarding</figcaption>
    </div>

    * *Graph annotation*. Think lines represents the least-cost paths from the recevier to the source A
    * *Message propagation*.
        1. Node A broadcast a source-A packet to nodes B and C
        2. Node B forwards the source-A packet to both C and D, and ignores any source-A packets recevied from any other nodes
        3. C ignores any source-A packet received from B, but after receiving a source-A packet from A

            $\to$ It forwards the packet to B, E, and F
    * *Duplication of messages*. Nodes B, C, D, E, and F receiver either one or two redundant packets
* *Objective*. Every node should receive only one copy of the broadcast packet

**Spanning-tree broadcast**.
* *Idea*. Examining the tree consisting of the nodes connected by thick lines in above figure
    * If broadcast packets were forwarded only along links within this tree
        
        $\to$ Each and every network node would receive exactly one copy of the broadcast packet
    * This is exactly the solution we were looking for
* *Spanning tree*.
    * *Spanning tree*. A tree that containing each and every node in a graph
        * *Formal*. A spanning tree of a graph $G = (N,E)$ is a graph $G' = (N,E')$ such that
            * $E'$ is a subset of $E$
            * $G'$ is connected and contains no cycles
            * $G'$ contains all the original nodes in $G$
    * *Minimum spanning tree*. If each link has an associated cost and the cost of a tree is the sum of the link costs
        
        $\to$ A spanning tree whose cost is the minimum of all of the graph’s spanning trees is a minimum spanning tree
* *Solution to providing broadcast*.
    1. The network nodes construct a spanning tree
    2. When a source node wants to send a broadcast packet
        
        $\to$ It sends the packet out on all of the incident links that belong to the spanning tree
    3. A node receiving a broadcast packet forwards the packet to all its neighbors in the spanning tree, except the neighbor from which it received the packet
* *Pros and cons*.
    * *Pros*.
        * Spanning tree eliminates redundant broadcast packets
        * Spanning tree can be used by any node to begin a broadcast
        * A node need not be aware of the entire tree, i.e. it only needs to know which of its neighbors in $G$ are spanning-tree neighbors
    * *Cons*. The complexity of the creation and maintenance of the spanning tree

**Center-based approach for spanning-tree construction**. A center node, i.e. a rendezvous point or a core, is defined
1. Nodes unicast tree-join messages addressed to the center node
2. A tree-join message is forwarded using unicast routing toward the center until 
    * It arrives at a node, which already belongs to the spanning tree, or
    * It arrives at the center node
3. In either case, the path followed by the tree-join message defines the branch of the spanning tree between the edge, which that initiated the tree-join message and the center
    
    $\to$ One can think of this new path as being grafted onto the existing spanning tree

### Broadcast algorithms in practice
**Brief**. Broadcast protocols are used in practice at both the application and network layers

**Gnutella's approach**. Use application-level broadcast to broadcast queries for content among Gnutella peers
* *Definition of link between two distributed application-level peer processes*. A TCP connection
* *Flooding algorithm*. A form of sequence-number-controlled flooding, in which a 16-bit identifier and a 16-bit payload descriptor are used to detect whether a received broadcast query has been previously received, duplicated, and forwarded
    * *Payload descriptor*. Identify the Gnutella message type 
* *Time-to-live*. Gnutella uses a time-to-live (TTL) field to limit the number of hops, over which a flooded query will be forwarded
    * *Idea*. When a Gnutella process receives and duplicates a query
        
        $\to$ It decrements the TTL field before forwarding the query
    * *Consequence*. A flooded Gnutella query will only reach peers that are within a given number, i.e. the initial value of TTL, of application-level hops from the query initiator
        
        $\to$ Gnutella’s flooding mechanism is sometimes referred to as limited-scope flooding

**OSPF's approach**. A form of sequence-number-controlled flooding is used to broadcast link-state advertisements (LSAs) in the OSPF routing algorithm, and in the Intermediate-System-to-Intermediate-System (IS-IS) routing algorithm
* *OSPF routing algorithm*. Use a 32-bit sequence number and a 16-bit age field to identify LSAs
    * *When to broadcast LSAs (recall)*. An OSPF node broadcasts LSAs for its attached links periodically
        * When a link cost to a neighbor changes, or
        * when a link goes up or down
    * *LSA sequence numbers' usage*. 
        * Used to detect duplicate LSAs
        * With flooding, it is possible for an LSA generated by the source at time $t$ to arrive, after a newer LSA that was generated by the same source at time $t + d$

            $\to$ The sequence numbers used by the source node allow an older LSA to be distinguished from a newer LSA
    * *LSA age field*. Serve a purpose similar to that of a TTL value
        * *Idea*. The initial age field value is set to zero and is incremented at each hop as
            * It is flooded, or
            * It sits in a router’s memory waiting to be flooded

## Multicast
**Multicast**. A multicast packet is delivered to only a subset of network nodes
* *Usage*. A number of emerging network applications require the delivery of packets from one or more senders to a group of receivers, e.g.
    * Bulk data transfer, e.g. the transfer of a software upgrade from the software developer to users needing the upgrade
    * Streaming continuous media, e.g. the transfer of the audio, video, and text of a live lecture to a set of distributed lecture participants
    * Shared data applications, e.g. a whiteboard or teleconferencing application shared among many distributed participants
    * Data feeds, e.g. stock quotes
    * Web cache updating
    * Interactive gaming, e.g. distributed interactive virtual environments or multiplayer games
* *Key problems*. 
    * How to identify the receivers of a multicast packet
    * How to address a packet sent to these receivers
* *Solutions in other communication schemes*. 
    * *Unicast communication*. The IP address of the receiver, i.e. destination, is carried in each IP unicast datagram and identifies the single recipient
    * *Broadcast*. All nodes need to receive the broadcast packet, hence no destination addresses are needed
    * *Multicast*. There are multiple receivers, it may make sense for each multicast packet to carry the IP addresses of all of the multiple recipients
        * *Problems*. 
            * It would not scale well to the case of hundreds or thousands of receivers
                * *Explain*. The amount of addressing information in the datagram would swamp the amount of data actually carried in the packet’s payload field
            * This requires that the sender know the identities and addresses of all of the receivers

**Address indirection**. In the Internet architecture, and other network architectures such as ATM, a multicast packet is addressed using address indirection
* *Idea*. 
    * A single identifier is used for the group of receivers
    * A copy of the packet addressed to the group using this identifier is delivered to all of the multicast receivers associated with that group
* *Internet's implementation*. The identifier representing a group of receivers is a class D multicast IP address

    <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GnRfihu.png">
        <figcaption>The multicast group - A datagram addressed to the group is delivered to all members of the multicast group</figcaption>
    </div>

    * *Multicast group*. The group of receivers associated with a class D address
* *Remaning issues*. Each host has a unique IP unicast address, which is completely independent of the address of the multicast group in which it is participating

**Consequential questions related to multicast groups**.
* How does a group get started and how does it terminate?
* How is the group address chosen?
* How are new hosts added to the group, either as senders or receivers?
* Can anyone join a group, and send to, or receive from, that group, or is group membership restricted and, if so, by whom?
* Do group members know the identities of the other group members as part of the network-layer protocol?
* How do the network nodes interoperate with each other to deliver a multicast datagram to all group members?

### Internet group management protocol
**IGMP protocol version 3**. Operate between a host and its directly attached router
* *Idea*. The directly attached router can be seen as 
    * The firsthop router, which a host would see on a path to any other host outside its own local network, or
    * The last-hop router on any path to that host
* *Network structure*. Consider three first-hop multicast routers, each connected to its attached hosts via one outgoing local interface

    $\to$ This local interface is attached to a LAN

    <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/LrhIcDK.png">
        <figcaption>The two components of the network-layer multicast in the Internet - IGMP and multicast routing protocols</figcaption>
    </div>

    * *Multicast group*. While each LAN has multiple attached hosts, at most a few of these hosts will typically belong to a given multicast group at any given time
* *Host-to-router communication*. IGMP provides the means for a host to inform its attached router that an application running on the host wants to join a specific multicast group
* *Multicast routing protocols*. 
    * *Needs for multicast routing protocols*. Since the scope of IGMP interaction is limited to a host and its attached router
        
        $\to$ Another protocol is required to coordinate the multicast routers, including the attached routers, throughout the Internet
        * *Explain*. This protocol will route multicast datagrams to their final destinations
    * *Network-layer multicast routing algorithms*. This functionality is accomplished by network-layer multicast routing algorithms
* *Conclusion*. Network-layer multicast in the Internet consists of two complementary components, i.e. IGMP and multicast routing protocols

**Message types of IGMP**. IGMP has only three message types

>**NOTE**. Like ICMP, IGMP messages are carried, i.e. encapsulated, within an IP datagram, with an IP protocol number of 2

* *`membership_query` message*. Sent by a router to all hosts on an attached interface to determine the set of all multicast groups, which have been joined by the hosts on that interface
* *`membership_report` message*. 
    * Hosts respond to a `membership_query` message with an IGMP `membership_report` message
    * When an application first joins a multicast group
        
        $\to$ `membership_report` messages is generated by a host, without waiting for a `membership_query` message from the router
* *`leave_group` message*. Interestingly, this message is optional
    * *Leaving host detection by router without `leave_group` message*. The router infers that a host is no longer in the multicast group if it no longer responds to a `membership_query` message with the given group address
        * *Soft-state protocol*. This is an example of soft state in an Internet protocol
            * *Idea*. The state is removed via a timeout event, if it is not explicitly refreshed, e.g.
                * The state, in case of IGMP, is the fact that there are hosts joined to a given multicast group
                * The timeout event, in case of IGMP, is a periodic `membership_query` message from the router
                * The refreshing, in case of IGMP, is a `membership_report` message from an attached host

**Soft-state protocol**. The term "soft state" was coined by Clark in 1988, who described the notion of periodic state refresh messages being sent by an end system
* *Idea*. With refresh messages, state could be lost in a crash and then automatically restored by subsequent refresh messages
    
    $\to$ All of these are done transparently to the end system and without invoking any explicit crash-recovery procedures
* *Benefits*. Soft-state protocols result in simpler control than hardstate protocols, i.e.
    * Hard-state protocols require state to be explicitly added and removed
    * Hard-state protocols require mechanisms to recover from the situation, where the entity responsible for removing state has terminated prematurely or failed

### Multicast routing algorithms
**Multicast routing problem**. Consider the following network

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/j7bg4jt.png">
    <figcaption>Multicast hosts, their attached routers, and other routers</figcaption>
</div>

* *Notation*. 
    * Hosts joined to the multicast group are shaded in color
    * Their immediately attached router is also shaded in color
* *Routers receiving multicast traffic*. Only a subset of routers, i.e. those with attached hosts joined to the multicast group, actually needs to receive the multicast traffic

    $\to$ Only routers A, B, E, and F need to receive the multicast traffic
* *Objective of multicast routing*. Find a tree of links connecting all of the routers, which have attached hosts belonging to the multicast group
    
    $\to$ Multicast packets will then be routed along this tree from the sender to all of the hosts belonging to the multicast tree
    
    >**NOTE**. The tree may contain routers that do not have attached hosts belonging to the multicast group

**Approaches for multicast routing tree**. In practice, two approaches have been adopted for determining the multicast routing tree

>**NOTE**. Both approaches have been introduced in the context of broadcast routing
>
>$\to$ We will only mention them in passing here

* *Differences between two approaches*. The two approaches differ according to 
    * Whether a single group-shared tree is used to distribute the traffic for all senders in the group, or 
    * Whether a source-specific routing tree is constructed for each individual sender.`
* *Multicast routing using a group-shared tree*. Multicast routing over a group-shared tree is based on building a tree including all edge routers with attached hosts belonging to the multicast group
    * *Multicast routing tree construction*. Use a center-based approach
        1.  Edge routers with attached hosts belonging to the multicast group send, via unicast, join messages addressed to the center node
        2.  A join message is forwarded using unicast routing toward the center until it either arrives at 
            * A router that already belongs to the multicast tree, or
            * The center
        3. All routers along the path, which the join message follows, forward received multicast packets to the edge router, which initiated the multicast join
    * *Center selection*. A critical question for center-based tree multicast routing
* *Multicast routing using a source-based tree*. Construct a multicast routing tree for each source in the multicast group
    * *Multicast routing tree construction*. Use an RPF algorithm, with source node `x`, for multicast datagrams originating at source `x`
    * *Modification of RPF broadcast algorithm*. Consider router D in the following network
        
        <div style="text-align:center">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/VOovICu.png">
            <figcaption>Reverse path forwarding for multicast case</figcaption>
        </div>

        * *Problem*. Under broadcast RPF, it would forward packets to router G, yet G has no attached hosts joined to the multicast group
            
            $\to$ If there were thousands of routers downstream from D, the problem is dramatic
        * *Solution*. Use pruning
            * *Idea*. A multicast router receiving multicast packets with no attached hosts joined to that group will send a prune message to its upstream router
                
                $\to$ If a router receives prune messages from each of its downstream routers, it can forward a prune message upstream

### Multicast routing in the Internet
**Distance-Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP)**. The first multicast routing protocol used in the Internet
* *Idea*. Use source-based trees with reverse path forwarding and pruning
    
    $\to$ DVMRP uses an RPF algorithm with pruning

**Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM) routing protocol**. Perhaps the most widely used Internet multicast routing protocol

$\to$ This protocol explicitly recognizes two multicast distribution scenarios
* *Dense mode*. Multicast group members are densely located, i.e. many or most of the routers in the area need to be involved in routing multicast datagrams
    * *Idea*. Use a flood-and-prune reverse path forwarding technique similar in spirit to DVMRP
* *Sparse mode*. The number of routers with attached group members is small w.r.t the total number of routers
    
    $\to$ Group members are widely dispersed
    * *Idea*. Use rendezvous points to set up the multicast distribution tree

**Source-specific multicast (SSM)**. Only one sender is allowed to send traffic into the multicast tree, considerably simplifying tree construction and maintenance

**PIM and DVMP in network domains**.
* *PIM and DVMP used within a domain*. The network operator can configure IP multicast routers within the domain
    
    $\to$ This is similar to intradomain unicast routing protocols, e.g. RIP, IS-IS, and OSPF, configuration
* *PIM and DVMP used within multiple domains*. Is there a multicast equivalent of the inter-domain BGP protocol?
    
    $\to$ The answer is literally yes
    * *Multiprotocol extensions to BGP*. Defined by RFC 4271 to allow it to carry routing information for other protocols, including multicast information
    * *The Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP)*. Can be used to connect together rendezvous points in different PIM sparse mode domains

**Development of IP multicast**. IP multicast has yet to take off in a big way

$\to$ Nonetheless, in spite of the lack of widespread deployment, network-level multicast is far from dead
* *Explain*. Multicast traffic has been carried for many years on Internet 2, and the networks with which it peers, e.g.
    * *Example*. In the U.K., the BBC is engaged in trials of content distribution via IP multicast
* *Multicast in application layer*. At the same time, application-level multicast provides multicast distribution of content among peers using application-layer, rather than network-layer, multicast protocols
    * *Question of interest*. Will future multicast services be primarily implemented in the network layer, in the network core, or in the application layer, at the network’s edge?
