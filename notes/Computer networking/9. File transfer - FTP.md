# File transfer - FTP
**Typical FTP session**. The use is sitting in front of the local host and wants to transfer files to or from a remote host
* *Requirements*. To access the remote account, the user must provide a user identification and a password

    $\to$ After this, the user can transfer files from the local file system to the remote file system and vice versa

**FTP user agent**. The user interacts with FTP via an FTP user agent

1. The user provides the hostname of the remote host, causing the FTP client process in the local host to establish a TCP connection with the FTP server process in the remote host
2. The user then provides the user identification and password, which are sent over the TCP connection as part of FTP commands
3. Once the server has authorized the user, the user copies one or more files stored in the local file system into the remote file system, or vice versa

**FTP and HTTP**.
* *Similarities*. Both are file transfer protocols and have many common characteristics, e.g. they both run on top of TCP
* *The most striking difference*. 
    * FTP uses two parallel TCP connections to transfer a file, i.e. FTP is said its control information out-of-band
        * *Control connection*. Used for sending control information between the two hosts, e.g. user identification, password, commands to change remote directory, and commands to put and get files
        * *Data connection*. Used to actually send a file
    * HTTP sends request and rÃ©ponse header lines into the same TCP connection which carries the transferred file itself

        $\to$ HTTP is said to send its control information in-band

**Detail data flow with FTP**.
1. The user starts an FTP session with a remote host
2. Client side of FTP, i.e. user, initiates a control TCP connection with the server side, i.e. remote host, on server port number 21
3. The client side of FTP sends the user identification and password over this control connection
4. The client sends, over the control connection, a command to change the remote directory
5. When the server receives a command for a file transfer over the control connection, the server side initiates a TCP data connection to the client side
6. FTP sends exactly one file over the data connection then closes the data connection
7. If, during the same session, the user wants to transfer another file, FTP opens another data connection

    $\to$ With FTP, the control connection remains oen throughout the duration of the user session, but a new data connection is created for each file transferred within a session

**User state**. Throughout a session, the FTP server must maintain state about the user
* *Purpose*. 
    * Associate the control connection with a specific user account
    * Keep track of the user's current directory as the user wanders about the remote directory tree
* *Consequence*. Keeping track of user state for each ongoing user session significantly constraints the total number of sessions which FTP can maintain simultaneously

    >**NOTE**. HTTP, on the other hand, is stateless, thus it does not have to keep track of any user state

## FTP commands and replies
**Command formats**. Commands, from client to server, and replies, from server to client, are sent across the control connection in 7-bit ASCII format

$\to$ FTP commands are readable by people
* *Command structure*. Each command consists of four uppercase ASCII characters, some with optional arguments
* *Common commands*.
    * *`USER username`*. Used to send the user identification to the server
    * *`PASS password`*. Used to send the user password to the sever
    * *`LIST`*. Used to ask the server to send back a list of all the files in the current remote directory

        $\to$ The list of files is sent over a new and non-persistent data connection, rather than the control TCP connection
    * *`RETR filename`*. Used to retrieve, i.e. get, a file from the current remote directory

        $\to$ This command causes the remote host to initiate a data connection and to send the requested file over the data connection
    * *`STOR filename`*. Used to store, i.e. put, a file into the current remote directory
* *Correspondence between the command issued by the user and the FTP command sent across the control connection*. Typically a one-to-one correspondence

**Replies format**. The replies are three-digit numbers, with an optional message following the number
* *Common messages*.
    * `331 Username OK, password required`
    * `125 Data connection already open; transfer starting`
    * `425 Can't open data connection`
    * `452 Error writing file`
