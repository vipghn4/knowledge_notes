# Securing TCP connections - SSL
**Key idea**. Cryptographic techniques can provide confidentiality, data integrity, and end-point authentication to a specific application

$\to$ We can enhance TCP with security services, e.g. confidentiality, data integrity and end-point authentication, using cryptography

**Secure sockets layer (SSL)**. An enhancement version of TCP using cryptography

    <figcaption>Although SSL technically resides in the application layer, from the developer's perspective it is a transport-layer protocol</figcaption>
</div>

* *Transport layer security (TLS)*. A modified version of SSL version 3, which has been standardized by the IETF
* *Idea of SSL*. Address security issues by enhancing TCP with confidentiality, data integrity, server authentication, and client authentication
* *Usage*. 
    * Provide security to transactions taking place over HTTP
    * Employed by any application running over TCP, since SSL secures TCP
* *Using SSL*. SSL provides API with sockets, which is similar and analogous to TCP's API

    $\to$ When an application wants to employ SSL, the application includes SSL classes and libraries

**History of SSL**. Originally proposed by Netscape, but the basic ideas behind securing TCP has predated Netscape's work

$\to$ Since its inception, SSL has enjoyed broad deployment, and is supported by all popular Web browsers and Web servers, used by essentially all Internet commerce sites

## The big picture
**Phases of operation in SSL**. Handshake, key derivation, and data transfer

### Handshake
**Handshake procedure**. Assume that a client (Bob) and a server (Alice) are having a communication session, with Alice having a private / public key pair, and a certificate which binds her identity to her public key

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/nWuJnbS.png">
    <figcaption>The almost-SSL handshake, beginning with a TCP connection</figcaption>
</div>

* *Phase A*. Bob establish a TCP connection with Alice
* *Phase B*.
    1. Bob sends a hello message to Alice
    2. Alice responds with her certificate, containing her public key
* *Phase C*.
    1. Bob verifies that Alice is really Alice by verifying the received certificate
    2. Bob then generates a master secret (MS) key, which will only be used for this SSL session
    3. Bob encrypts the MS with Alice's public key to create the Encrypted master secret (EMS)
    4. Bob sends the EMS to Alice
    5. Alice decrypts the EMS with her private key to get the MS
    6. Both Bob and Alice know the master secret for this SSL session

### Key derivation
**Master secret**. The MS shared by Bob and Alice could be used as the symmetric session key for all subsequent encryption and data integrity checking

$\to$ It is, however, generally safer for Alice and Bob to each use different cryptographic keys, and also use different keys for encryption and integrity checking
* *Key derivation*. Both Alice and Bob use the MS to generate four keys, i.e. each of them generate the four keys from the MS
    * $E_B$, i.e. session encryption key for data sent from Bob to Alice
    * $M_B$, i.e. session MAC key for data sent from Bob to Alice
    * $E_A$, i.e. session encryption key for data sent from Alice to Bob
    * $M_A$, i.e. session MAC key for data sent from Alice to Bob
* *Simple key derivation*. Slice the MS into four keys

    >**NOTE**. In real SSL, it is a little more complicated

* *Purposes of keys*.
    * *Encryption keys*. Used to encrypt data
    * *MAC keys*. Used to verify the integrity of the data

### Data transfer
**Data flow for sending data with SSL-enhanced TCP**.
1. Use SSL to encrypt application data on the fly
    1. SSL breaks the data stream into records, appends a MAC to each record for integrity checking
        * *MAC creation*. Bob inputs the record along with the key $M_B$ into a hash function
    2. SSL encrypts the record + MAC
        * *Data encryption*. Bob uses his session encryption key $E_B$ to encrypt record+MAC
2. Pass the encrypted data on the fly to TCP

**Problem**. Although the data flow above goes a long way, it still is not bullet-proof when it comes to providing data integrity for the entire message stream
* *Example*. Suppose a woman-in-the-middle has the ability to insert, delete, and replace segments in the stream of TCP segments between Alice and Bob

    $\to$ She may capture two segments sent by Bob, reverse the order of the segments, adjust the TCP sequence numbers (which are not encrypted), then send the two reversed-ordered segments to Alice
* *Consequence*. Suppose that each TCP segment encapsulates exactly one record

    $\to$ Alice will receive messages in incorrect order compared to what sent by Bob
* *Solution*. Use sequence numbers
    * *Idea*. Bob maintains a sequence number counter beginning at zero and is incremented for each SSL record he sends

        $\to$ Bob does not include a sequence number in the record itself, but when he calculates the MAC, he includes the sequence number in the MAC calculation
    * *Consequence*. The MAC is now a hash of the data, plus the MAC key $M_B$, plus the current sequence number

        $\to$ Alice tracks Bob's sequence numbers, allowing her to verify the data integrity o f a record by including the appropriate sequence number in the MAC calculation

### SSL record
**SSL record format**.

<div style="text-align:center">

    <figcaption>SSL record format</figcaption>
</div>

* *Type field*. Indicate whether the record is a handshake message, or a message containing application data, or used to close the SSL connection
* *Version field*. Self-explanatory
* *Length field*. Used to extract the SSL records out of the incoming TCP byte stream
* *Data field*. Contain data
* *MAC field*. Contain MAC for data integrity checking

## A more complete picture
### SSL handshake
**Key algorithms**. SSL does not mandate that Alice and Bob use a specific key algorithm, a specific public-key algorithm, or a specific MAC

$\to$ SSL allows Alice and Bob to agree on the cryptographic algorithms at the beginning of the SSL session, during the handshake phase
* *Consequence*. During the handshake phase, Alice and Bob send nonces to each other, which are used in the creation of the session's four keys

**Real SSL handshake procedure**.
1. The client sends a list of cryptographic algorithm it supports, along with a client nonce
2. From the list, the server chooses a symmetric algorithm, e.g. AES, a public key algorithm, e.g. RSA, and a MAC algorithm
3. The server sends back to the client its choices, and a certificate and a server nonce
4. The client verifies the certificate, extracts the server's public key, generates a Pre-Master Secret (PMS), encrypts the PMS with the server's public key, and sends the encrypted RMS to the server
5. Using the same key derivation function, as specified by the SSL standard, the client and server independently compute the Master Secret (MS) from the PMS and nonces
6. The MS is then sliced up to generate two encryption and two MAC keys
    
    >**NOTE**. When the chosen symmetric cipher employes CBC, e.g. 3DES or AES, then two Initialization Vectors (IVs), one for each side of the connection, are also obtained from the MS
    >$\to$ All messages sent between client and server are encrypted and authenticated (with the MAC)

7. The client sends a MAC of all handshake messages
8. The server sends a MAC for all the handshake messages

**Protecting handshake from tampering**. The last two steps of the handshake procedure protect it from tampering
* *Explain*. The client typically offers a list of algorithms, some strong and some weak, in cleartext, since the encryption algorithms and keys have not yet been agreed upon

    $\to$ A man-in-the-middle could delete the stronger algorithms from the list, forcing the client to select a weak algorithm
* *Solution*. 
    * The client sends a MAC of concatenation of all the handshake messages it sent and received

        $\to$ The server can compare this MAC with the MAC of the handshake message it received and sent
        * *Consequecne*. If threre is an inconsistency, the server can terminate the connection
    * The server sends a MAC of the handskae messages it has seen, allowing the client to check for inconsistencies

### Conection closure
**Connection closure options**.
* *Option 1*. Let Bob end the SSL session by simply terminating the underlying TCP connection
    * *Truncation attack*. This option sets the stage for truncation attack, where a man-in-the-middle ends the session early with a TCP FIN

        $\to$ Alice would think she received all of Bob's data when actuality she only received a portion of it
* *Option 2*. Indicate in the type field whether the record serves to terminate the SSL session
    * *Explain*. Although the SSL type is sent in the clear, it is authenticated at the receiver using the record's MAC
    * *Consequence*. If Alice were to receive a TCP FIN before receiving a closure SSL record, she would know that something weird is going on

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Cryptographic nonce**. An arbitrary number which can be used just once in a cryptographic communication

$\to$ It is often a random number of pseudo-random number issued in an authentication protocol, to ensure that old communications cannot be reused in replay attacks

**Message authentication code (MAC)**. A short piece of information used to authenticate a message, i.e. to confirm that the message came from the stated sender, and has not been changed
