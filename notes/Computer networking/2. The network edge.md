# The network edge
**Hosts**. End systems are also referred as hosts, since they host, i.e. run, application programs

$\to$ We can say "end systems" and "hosts" exchangably
* *Clients and servers*. Hosts are sometimes further divided into clients, i.e. service requesters, and servers, i.e. service or resource providers

## Access networks
**Access network**. The network which physically connects an end system to the first router, i.e. the edge router, on a path from the end system to any other distant end system

### Home access - DSL, cable, FTTH, dial-up, and satellite
**Two most prevalent types of broadband residential access**. Digital subscriber line (DSL) and cable

**Digital subscriber line (DSL)**. A residence typically obtain DSL Internet access from the same local telephone company (telco) providing its wired local phone access

$\to$ When DSL is used, a customer's telco is also its ISP

<div style="text-align:center">

    <figcaption>DSL internet access</figcaption>
</div>

* *Data exchange*. Via telephone line, with a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) located in the telco's local central office (CO)
    1. The home's DSL modem takes digital data and translate it to high-frequency tones for transmission over telephone writes to the CO
    2. The analog signals from many houses are translated back into digital format at the DSLAM
* *Residential telephone line*. Carry both data and traditional telephone signals simultaneously
    * *Encoded frequencies in residential telephone line*. To make the single DSL link appear as if there were tree seperate links, there are 3 different frequencies
        * *High-speed downstream channel*. 50kHz to 1MHz band
        * *Medium-speed upstream channel*. 4kHz to 50kHz band
        * *Ordinary two-way telephone channel*. 0 to 4kHz band
    * *Consequence*. Telephone call and Internet connection can share the DSK link at the same time
* *Splitter*. 
    1. On the customer side, a splitter seperates the data and telephone signals arriving to the home
    2. Forward the data signal to the DSL modem
* *DSLAM*. Seperate the data and phone signals and send the data into the Internet
* *Assymetric access*. When the downstream and upstream rates are different
    * *Example*. DSL standards
* *Usage*. Engineers have expressly designed DSL for short distances between the home and the CO

    $\to$ Generally, if the residence is not located within 5 or 10 miles of the CO, it must resort to an alternative form of Internet access

**Cable Internet access**. Make use of the cable television company's existing cable television infrastructure

$\to$ A residence obtain cable Internet access from the same company providing its cable television
* *Idea*. Using coaxial cables prevent power losses, which occur in other types of transmission lines, thus allow for longer transmission distance
    * *Hybrid fiber coax (HFC)*. Refer to the fact that both fiber and coaxial cable are employed in signal transmission
* *Network structure*.

    <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/iQZWoh3.png">
        <figcaption>A hybrid fiber-coaxial access network</figcaption>
    </div>

    * Fiber optics connect the cable head end to to neighborhood-level junctions, from which traditional coaxial cable is then used to reach individual homes and apartments
        * *Supported number of homes per neighborhood function*. About 500 to 5000 homes
    * *Modem*. Cable internet access requires special modem, called cable modems, which are typically an external device connecting to the home PC through an Ethernet port
    * *Cable modem termination system (CMTS)*. At the cable head and, the CMTS serves a similar function as the DSL network's DSLAM

        $\to$ It turns the analog signal sent from cable modems in many downstream homes back into digital format
* *Downstream and upsteam signals*. Cable modems divide the HFC network into downstream and upstream channels, with typically asymmetric access
* *Shared broadcast medium*. This is an important characteristics of cable Internet access
    * *Idea*. 
        * Every packet sent by the head end travels downstream on every link to every home
        * Every packet sent by a home travels on the upstream channel to the head end
    * *Example*. If the cable head end is transmitting a packet `ContextX` and suppose 10 homes are connected to it

        $\to$ 10 `ContentX` packets will be sent through the link, and each home will get one
    * *Explain*. The original Ethernet was on coax, a broadcast medium, thus every host could hear everything on the network segment
        * *Downloading data*. The cable ISP only sends a data frame once, and the shared medium may deliver it to all the sites on a segment, as the way cable video is sent once to all the homes on a segment
            
            $\to$ A cable modem only listens to frames destined to its address, ignoring all the others
        * *Uploading data*. When we send something to the ISP, the frame may be received by all the cable modems on the segment

            $\to$ But only the ISP equipment is listening to frames addressed to it
    * *Motivation*. Cable networks were primerally designed for broadcasting TV
    * *Consequence*. 
        * If several users are simultaneously downloading a video file on the downstream channel

            $\to$ The actual rate, at which each user receives its video file will be significantly lower than the aggregate cable downstream rate
        * If there are only a few active users, and they are all Web surfing, then each of the users may actually receive Web pages at the full cable downstream rate
    * *Layer broadcast*. Do not confuse layer-1 broadcast (in this case) to a layer-2 or layer-3 broadcast
        * *Layer-1 broadcast*. A signal is sent everywhere
        * *Layer-2 or layer-3 broadcast*. A frame or packet addressed for every host
    * *Issues with shared broadcast medium*.
        * *Media access control (MAC)*. Ethernet adopted MAC so that an Ethernet host only listen to packets addressed to it

            $\to$ The medium has nothing to do with how the frames are addressed
        * *Transmission coordination and collisions*. The upstream channel is also shared, thus a distributed multiple access protocol is required to coordinate transmissions and avoid collisioins
        * *Security*. Coaxial cables have no physical transmission security and can be easily tapped without interrupting regular transmissions and without detection
* *Usage nowadays*. Coaxial cables are no longer deployed en masse, but they are still adundant in legacy environments

**Fiber to the home (FTTH)**. An up-coming technology which promises even higher speeds
* *Idea*. Provide an optical fiber path from the CO directly to the home
* *CO-to-home optical distribution technology*.
    * *Direct fiber*. The simplest optical distribution network
        * *Idea*. One fiber leaving the CO for each home
        * *Implementation*. Each fiber leaving the CO is shared by many homes

            $\to$ Until the fiber gets relatively close to the homes that it is split into individual customer-specific fibers
        * *Splitting architectures*. Active optical networks (AONs) and passive optical networks (PONs)
* *Internet access rates*. FTTH can potentially provide Internet access rates in the gigabits per second range

**Other access network technologies**.
* *Satelitte link*. Used to connect a residence to the Internet at speeds of more than 1Mps
    * *Usage*. In locations where DSL, cable, and FTTH are not available
* *Dial-up access over traditional phone lines*. Based on the same model as DSL with slower rate

### Access in the enterprise (and the home) - Ethernet and WiFi
**Local area network (LAN)**. Used to connect an end system to the edge router on corporate and university campuses, and increasingly in home settings

**Ethernet**. The most prevalent access technology for LAN currently

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aret5ZL.png">
    <figcaption>FTTH Internet access</figcaption>
</div>

* *Idea*. 
    1. Ethernet users use twisted-pair copper wire to connect to an Ethernet switch
    2. The Ethernet switch, or a network of interconnected switches, is connected to the larger Internet

**Wireless LAN**. Users access the Internet wirelessly from their devices, transmitting and receiving packets to or from an access point connected into the enterprise's network, which is in turn connected to the wired Internet
* *WiFi*. IEEE 802.11 technology
* *Range*. A few tens of meters

### Wide-area wireless access - 3D and LTE
**Cellular network provider**. Devices like smartphones employ the same wireless infrastructure used for cellular telephony to send and receive packets through a base station operated by the cellular network provider
* *Range*. A few tens of kilometers of the base station

**3G and 4G**. 
* *3G*. Provide packet-switched wide-area wireless Internet access at speeds in excess of 1Mbps
* *4G*. Provide higher-speed wide-area access technologies

**LTE (Long-term evolution)**. Rooted in 3G technology, and can potentially achieve rates in excess of 10Mbps

## Physical media
**Brief life of a bit**. Consider a bit traveling from one end system, through a series of links and routers, to another end system
* *Life of a bit*.
    1. The source end system first transmits the bit
    2. Shortly thereafter, the first router in the series receives the bit, then transmits the bit
    3. Shortly thereafter, the second router in the series receives the bit, then transmits the bit, etc.
* *Conclusion*. The bit, when traveling from source to destination, passes through a series of transmitter-receiver pairs

    $\to$ For each of these pair, the bit is sent by propagating electromagnetic waves or optical pulses across a physical medium

**Physical medium**. Can take many shapes and forms and does not have to be of the type for each transmitter-receiver pair along the path
* *Example*. Twisted-pair copper wire, coaxial cable, multimode fiber-optic cable, etc.
* *Types of physical medium*.
    * *Guided emdia*. The waves are guided along a solid medium, e.g. a fiber-optic cable, a twisted-pair copper wire, or a coaxial cable
    * *Unguided media*. The waves propagate in the atmosphere and in outer space, e.g. wireless LAN or digital satellite channel
* *Cost of the physical link*. Often relatively minor compared to other networking costs, e.g. labor cost

    $\to$ Many builders install twisted pair, optical fiber, and coaxial cable in every room in a building

### Twisted-pair copper wire
**Twisted-pair copper wire**. The least expensive and most commonly used guided transmission medium
* *History of twisted-pair copper wire*. Used by telephone networks for over a hundred years

    $\to$ More than 99% of the wired connections from the telephone handset to the local telephone switch use twisted-pair copper wire
* *Medium structure*. Consist of two insulated copper wires, each of 1mm thick, arranged in a regular spiral pattern
    * *Explain*. The wires are twisted together to reduce the electrical interference from similar pair closeby
    * *Implementation*. Typically, a number of pairs are bundled together in a cable by wrapping the pairs in a protective shield
* *Communication link*. A wire pair constitues a single communication link
* *Usage*. Commonly used for high-speed LAN networking access

**Unshielded twisted pair (UTP)**. Commonly used for computer networks within a building, i.e. for LANs
* *Data rate today*. 10Mpbs to 10Gbps
    * *Aspects affecting the data rate*. The thickness of the wire, and the distance between transmitter and receiver

### Coaxial cable
**Coaxial cable**. Consist of two copper concentric conductors, with special insulation and shielding

$\to$ With this structure, i.e. reduced power loss at connection points, coaxial cable can achieve high data transmission rates
* *Usage*. Commonly used in cable television systems, and a guided shared medium

    >**NOTE**. A number of end systems can be connected directly to the cable, each of which receives whatever is sent by other end systems

### Fiber optics
**Optical fiber**. A thin, flexible medium which conducts pulses of light, with each pulse representing a bit
* *Date rate*. A single optical fiber can support tremendous bit rates, up to tens or hundreds of gigabits per second
* *Characteristics*.
    * Immune to electromagnetic interference
    * Very low signal attenuation up to 100 kilometers
    * Very hard to tap
* *Usage*. Long-haul guided transmission media, particularly for overseas links

### Terrestrial radio channels
**Radio channels**. Carry signals in electromagnetic spectrum
* *Characteristics*. Depend significantly on the propagation environment and the distance over which a signal to be carried
    * No physical wire required
    * Can penetrate walls
    * Provide connectivity to a mobile user
    * Potentially carry a signal for long distances
* *Environmental considerations*. Determine 
    * Path loss and shadow fading, i.e. decrement in signal strength as the signal travels over a distance and around / through obstructing objects
    * Multi-path fading, i.e. due to signal reflection off of interfering objects
    * Interference, i.e. due to other transmissions and electromagnetic signals

**Types of terrestrial radio channels**.
* Those operating over very short distance, i.e. one or two meters
* Those operating in local areas, i.e. typically from ten to a few hundred meters
* Those operating in the wide area, i.e. tens of kilometers

### Satellite radio channels
**Communication satellite**. Link two or more Earth-based microwave transmitter or receivers, i.e. ground stations
* *Idea*. The satellite receives transmissions on one frequency band, regenerates the signal using a repeater, and transmits the signal on another frequency

**Types of satellites in communications**.
* *Geostationary satellites*. Permanently remain above the same spot on Earth
    * *Implementation*. The stationary presence is achieved by placing the satellite in orbit at 36000 kilometers above the Earth's surface
    * *Pros*. Speed of hundreds of Mbps
    * *Cons*. Substantial signal propagation delay of 280 milliseconds
    * *Usage*. Used in areas without access to DSL or cable-based Internet access
* *LEO satellites*. Placed much closer to Earth and do not remain permanently above one spot on Earth
    
    $\to$ They rotate around Earth and may communicate with each other, as well as with ground stations
    * *Implementation*. To provide continuous coverage to an area, many satellites need to be placed in orbit
    * *Usage*. Sometime in the future

* *Outside home*.
    1. Each home has an optical network terminator (ONT) connected by dedicated optical fiber to a neighborhood splitted
    2. The splitter combines a number of homes (typically less than 100) onto a single, shared optical fiber connecting to an optical line terminator (OLT) in the telco's CO
    3. The OLT, providing conversion between optical and electrical signals, connects to the Internet via a telco router
* *Inside home*. Users connect a home router (typically a wireless router) to the ONT and access the Internet via this router
* *Packet transmission*. All packets sent from OLT to the splitted are replicated at the splitter

**Optical pulse**. In optics, an ultrashort pulse of light is an electromagnetic pulse, whose time duration is of the order of a picosecond, i.e. $10^{-12}$ second, or less, having a broadband optical spectrum

## Discussion
**Link layer**. Link layer (chapter 5 and 6) is very interesting
