# What is the Internet
## A nuts-and-bolts description
**The Internet**. A computer network interconnecting hundreds of millions of computing devices throughout the world

    <figcaption>Some pieces of the Internet</figcaption>
</div>

* *Host and end systems*. In Internet terminologies, all of the devices are called host or end systems
    * *End systems*. Connected together by a network of communication links and packet switches
* *Communication links*. Made up of different types of physical media, e.g. coaxial cable, copper wire, optical fiber, and radio spectrum
    * *Transmission rate*. Different links can transmit data at different rates
        * *Unit of measurement*. bits/second
    * *Data transmission idea*.
        1. When one end system has data to send to another end system

            $\to$ The sending end system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment
        2. The resulting packages of information, known as packets, are then sent through the network to the destination end system
        3. The packets are reassembled into the original data at the destination end system

**Packet switch**. Take a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links
* *Two most prominent types of packet switch*.  Both types of swithces forward packets towards their ultimate destinations
    * *Routers*. Typically used in the network core
    * *Link-layer switches*. Typically used in access network
* *Route or path through the network*. The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system
* *Abstraction*.
    * Packets are similar to trucks
    * Communication links are similar to highways and roads
    * Packet switches are similar to intersections
    * End systems are similar to buildings

**Internet service providers (ISPs)**. End systems access the Internet through ISPs, each of which is a network of packet switches and communication links
* *Types of ISPs*.
    * *Residential ISPs*. Local cable or telephone companies
    * *Corporate ISPs*
    * *University ISPs*
    * *ISPs providing WiFi access in airports, hotels, coffee shops, and public places*
* *Functionality*.
    * Provide a variety of types of network access to the end systems
        * *Example*. Residential broadband access, e.g. cable modem or DSL, high-speed LAN access, wireless access, or dial-up modem access
    * Provide Internet access to connect providers, connecting Web sites directly to the Internet
* *Connections between ISPs*. The Internet is about connecting end systems to each other

    $\to$ The ISPs providing access to end systems must interconnected
    * *Connection method*. Lower-tier ISPs are interconnected through national and international upper-tier ISPs, e.g. Level 3 Communications, AT&T, Sprint, and NTT
* *Upper-tier ISP*. Consist of high-speed routers interconnected with high-spped fiber-optic links

**Protocols**.
* *ISP protocols*. Each ISP network, whether upper- or lower-tier, is managed independently, runs the IP protocol, and conforms to certain naming and address conventions
* *End systems and packet switches protocols*. End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run protocols controling the sending and receiving of information within the Internet
* *Common protocols*.
    * *Two of the most important protocols in the Internet*. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP)
        * *IP protocol*. Specify the format of the packets sent and received among routers and end systems
    * *The Internet's principal protocols*. Collectively known as TCP/IP
* *Protocol standards*. It is important that everyone agree on what each and every protocol does, so that people can create systems and products which interoperate
    * *Internet standards*. Developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), whose standards documents are called requests for comments (RFCs)

## A services description
**The Internet as an infrastructure providing services to applications**.
* *Distributed applications*. The applications using services provided by the Internet
    * *Explain*. They involve multiple end systems exchanging data with each other

    >**NOTE**. It is very important to be aware that Internet applications run on end systems, rather than in the packet switches in the network core

    >**NOTE**. Packet switches facilitate the exchange of data among end systems, but they are not concerned with the application sending or receiving the data

* *Infrastructure semantics*. The central issue, i.e. the one leading to the alternative way of describing the Internet as a platform for applications, is "How does one program running on one end system instruct the Internet to deliver data to another program running on another end system"
    * *Application programming interface (API)*. End system attached to the Internet provide an API 
        * *Purpose*. Specify how a program running on one end system asks the Internet to deliver data to a specific destination program running aon another end system
    * *Idea*. Support Alice wants to send a letter to Bob using the postal service, she must follow the postal service API, or a set of rules, to have the postal service deliver her letter to Bob
        1. Alice write the letter (data) and put it in an envelope (making data)
        2. Alice write Bob's full name, address, and zip code in the center of the envelope (packing)
        3. Alice seal the envelope (encryption)
        4. Put a stamp int eh upper-right-hand corner of the envelope (acknowledgement)
        5. Drop the envelope into an official postal service mailbox (send data to mail server)
    * *Other services provided by the postal service*. Express delivery, reception confirmation, ordinary use, and many more services

## What is a protocol
### Network protocols
**Network protocol**. A system of rules allowing two or more entities of a communication system to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity

$\to$ All activity in the INternet involving two or more communicating remote entities is governed by a protocol
* *Example*.
    * Hardware-implemented protocols in two physically connected computers control the flow of bits on the "wire" between two network interface cards
    * Congestion-control protocols in end systems control the rate, at which packets are transmitted between sender and receiver (like data buffering in I/O modules)
    * Protocols in routers determine a packet's path from source to destination

**Definition elements of a protocol**. The exchange of messages and the actions taken when these messages are sent and received

$\to$ A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, and the actions taken on the transmission and / or recept of a message or other event

## Concepts
**Access network and network core**.

    <figcaption>Core and access network</figcaption>
</div>

* *Access network*. A type of telecommunications network which connects subscribers to their immediate service provider
* *Core network*. Connect local providers to one anothe

**Switch, modem, and router**.
* *Modem*. Provided by our ISP to enable a network access to the Internet
    * *Mode-router combination*. In some cases, ISPs provide hybrid modem-router combination, this device might the power efficient to some extent, but will limits our network potentials

        $\to$ Having a standalone modem is better
* *Router*. A traffic director of a network, required when connecting more than one device to a modem
    * *Functionality*. 
        1. Take information provided by the modem and routes it to the devices attached to the modem
        2. Create Network address translated (NAT) internal private IP address to the connected devices, so they can be accessed
* *Switch*. Used to provide additional ports, expanding the capability of the router
    * *Idea*. Learn the association between the Media access control (MAC) addresses of connected devices and its switched ports
    * *Data transmission*. A switch only sends data to where it needs to go, reducing the amount of data on the network

        $\to$ This increases the overall performance of the connected devices while improving security

    >**NOTE**. A switch should not provide routing capability and should not be connected directly to the modem, unless a Dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) server is present elsewhere in the network

**Network interface card (NIC)**. Also called network interface card, network adapter, LAN adapter, or physical network interface
* *Definition*. A computer hardware component connecting a computer to a computer network
* *Idea*.
    * *Early network interface controllers*. Commonly implemented on expansion cards plugged into a computer bus
    * *Modern network interface controllers*. Offer advanced features, e.g. interrupt, DMA interfaces, etc. to the host processors
* *Purpose*. Implement a electronic circuitry required to communicate using a specific physical layer and data link layer standard, e.g. Ethernet or Wi-Fi

**Message broker and network protocols**. A message broker is software enabling applications, systems, and services to communicate with each other and exchange information

$\to$ It does this by translating between formal messaging protocols
