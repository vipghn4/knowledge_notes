# Multimedia networking applications
## Properties of video
**High bit rate**. The most salient characteristic of video
* *Typical bit rate*. 100 kbps for low-quality video conferencing to over 3 Mbps for streaming high-definition movies
    * *Practical comparison*. Video streaming consumes by far the most bandwidth, having a bit rate of more than ten times greater than that of Facebook and music-streaming applications

**Video compression**. Another important characteristic of video is that it can be compressed, thereby trading off video quality with bit rate
* *Idea*. A video is a sequence of images, typically being displayed with a constant rate
    * *Uncompressed digitially encoded image*. Consist of an array of pixels, each of which is encoded into a number of bits to represent luminance and color
    * *Types of redundancy in video*. Spatial and temporal redundancy
* *Capacity of video compression*. Today's off-the-shelf compression algorithms can compress a video to essentially any desired bit rate
    * *Bit rate*. The number of bits used per second to represent a continuous medium, e.g. audio or video, after source coding, i.e. data compression

**Different video quality levels**. We can use compression to create multiple versions of the same video, each at a different quality level

$\to$ Users can decide which version they want to watch as a function of their current available bandwidth

## Properties of audio
**Audio versus video**. Digital audio, including digitialized speech and music, has significantly lower bandwidth requirements than video
* *Problem with audio*. Users are generally much more sensitive to audio glitches than video glitches

**Pulse code modulation (PCM)**. The basic encoding technique for analog-audio-to-digital-signal conversion
* *Procedure*.
    1. *Sampling*. The analog audio signal is sampled at some fixed rate, and each sampled value is an arbitrary real number
    2. *Quantization*. Each of the samples is rounded to one of a finite number of values
        * *Quantization values*. The finite values used for quantization
        * *Number of quantization values*. Typically a power of 2, e.g. 256
    3. *Digital representation*. Each of the quantization values is represented by a fixed number of bits

        $\to$ The bit representations of all the samples are then concatenated to form the digital representation of the signal
    4. *Playback*. For playback through audio speakers, the digital signal can be converted back, i.e. decoded, to an analog signal
        * *Playback quality*. The decoded analog signal is only an approximation of the original signal

            $\to$ The sound quality may be noticeably degraded
        * *Consequence*. There is a trade-off between the quality of the decoded signal and the bit-rate and storage requirements of the digital signal
* *Usage*. PCM-encoded speech and music are rarely used in the Internet

    $\to$ Compression techniques are used to reduce the bit rates of the stream instead

**Typical bit rate of recognizable human speech**. Less than 10 kbps

**Popular compression techniques for near CD-quality stereo music**.
* *MPEG 1 layer 3 (MP3)*. Can compress to many different rates, with the most common rate is 128 kbps
* *Advanced audio coding (AAC)*. Popularized by Apple, where support multiple versions of a prerecorded audio stream can be created, each at a different bit rate

## Types of multimedia network applications
**Types of multimedia network applications**.
* Streaming stored audio / video
* Conversational voice / video over IP
* Streaming live audio / video

### Streaming stored audio and video
**Problem of interest**. We focus on streaming stored video, which typically combines video and audio components
* *Explain*. Streaming stored audio, e.g. music, is very similar to streaming stored video, although the bit rates are typically much lower

**Streaming stored audio and video**. 
* *Description*. A prerecorded video, e.g. a movie, placed on servers

    $\to$ Users send requests to the servers to view the videos on demand

>**NOTE**. By some estimates, streaming stored video makes up over 50 percent of the downstream traffic in the Internet access networks today
* *Key features*.
    * *Streaming*. The client typically begins video playout within a few seconds after it begins receiving the video from the server
        * *Explain*. The client will be playing out from one location in the video, while at the same time receiving later parts of the video from the server
        * *Benefits*. The client does not have to download the entire video file before playout begins
    * *Interactivity*. Since the media is prerecorded, the user may pause, reposition forward, reposition backward, fast-forward, etc. through the video content
        * *The time from when the user makes such a request until the action manifests itself at the client*. Less than a few seconds for acceptable responsiveness
    * *Continuous playout*. Once playout of the video begins, it should proceed according to the original timing of the recording
        * *Consequence*. Data must be received from the server in time for its playout at the client

            $\to$ Otherwise, users experience video frame freezing or frame skipping

**Performance measure**. Throughput, i.e. to provide continuous playout, the network must provide an average throughput to the streaming application, which is at least as large the bit rate of the video itself
* *Techniques*. Buffering and prefetching to provide continuous playout, even when the throughput fluctuates

**Video location**. For many streaming video applications, prerecorded video is stored on, and streamed from, a CDN (content delivery network), rather than a single data center
* *Explain*. There are many P2P video streaming applications, for which the video is stored on users' hosts, with different chunks of video arriving from different peers

### Conversational voice / video over IP
**Internet telephony or Voice-over-IP (VoIP)**. Real-time conversational voice over the Internet
* *Explain*. From the user's perspective, it is similar to the traditional circuit switched telephone service
* *Conversational video*. Similar to VoIP, except that it includes the video of the participants as well as their voices
    * *Number of participants*. Most of today's voice and video conversational systems allow users to create conferences with three or more participants

**Classification of applications**. There are two axes to classify VoIP applications
* *Timing considerations*. Timing considerations are important since audio and video conversational applications are highly delay-sensitive
    * *Explain*. For a conversation with two or more interacting speakers

        $\to$ The delay from when a user speaks or moves until the action is manifested at the other end should be less than a few hundred milliseconds
    * *Ranges of time delay*.
        * Delays smaller than 150 milliseconds are not perceived by a human listener
        * Delays between 150 and 400 milliseconds can be acceptable
        * Delays exceeding 400 milliseconds can result in frustrating, if not completely unintelligible, voice conservations
* *Tolerance of data loss*. Occasional loss only causes occasional glitches in audio / video playback, and these losses can often be partially or fully concealed

### Streaming live audio / video
**Streaming live audio / video**. Similar to traditional broadcast radio and television, except that transmission takes place over the Internet
* *Explain*. These applications allow a user to receive a live radio or television transmission transmitted from any corner of the world

**Characteristics**. Broadcast-like applications often have many users who receive the same audio / video program at the same time
* *Idea of implementation*. Multicast distribution is more often implemented via application-layer multicast, e.g. P2P networks or CDNs, or via multiple separate unicast streams, rather than IP multicasting
* *Requirements*. The network must provide each live multimedia flow with an average throughput, which is larger than the video consumption rate
    * *Explain*. The event is live, thus delay can also be an issue
