# Financial assets
## Assets
**Asset**. Some item of value, i.e. valuable item, which is expected to provide the holder some future benefit
* *Examples*. Humans always consider some objects as assets
    * Food, shelter, clothing, water, etc. have value to people since they are necessary to survive
    * Gold or electricity have value since they make lives easier or more productive
    * Stocks and bonds have value since they allow us to share in the creation of further assets and wealth

## Financial assets
**Financial assets**. A liquid asset getting its value from a contractual right or ownership claim
* *Examples*. Cash, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and bank deposits
* *Analysis by Giang*. Financial assets = Liquidity + Ownership (or contractual right)
    * *Ownership and contractual right*. Financial asset represents ownership and contractual right
        * *Explain*. Selling financial assets is transferring ownership of some item and contractual right for cash

            $\to$ The physical item is still held by the seller, only ownership is transferred
    * *Liquid assets*. Include cash and other assets, which can quickly be turned into cash without losing value
        * *Explain*. This is the key of making ownership an asset, i.e.
            * Without liquidity, owning an item without having rights to use it is useless, i.e. we are not actually owning the item 
                * We cannot use the item for our purposes
                * We cannot sell the item for cash
            * With liquidity, the true ownership is guaranteed, i.e. we can eventually exchange the ownership for cash
                * We can take the item for personal use, or
                * We can sell the item for cash
* *Physical worth*. Financial assets do not necessarily have inherent physical worth, or even a physical form
    
    $\to$ Their value reflects 
    * Factors of supply and demand in the marketplace, in which they trade
    * The degree of risk they carry

**Examples**.
* *Example 1*. When an invoice is issued on the sale of goods on credit
    * The entity selling the goods has a financial asset, i.e. the receivable
    * The buyer has to account for a financial liability, i.e. the payable
* *Example 2*. When an entity raises finance by issuing equity shares
    * The entity subscribing to the shares has a financial asset, i.e. an investment
    * The issuer of the shares, who raised finance, has to account for an equity instrument, i.e. equity share capital
* *Example 3*. When an entity raises finance by issuing bonds, i.e. debentures
    * The entity subscribing to the bonds, i.e. lends the money, has a financial asset, i.e. an investment
    * The issuer of the bonds, i.e. the borrower, who has raised the finance, has to account for the bonds as a financial liability

**Understanding financial assets**. Most assets are categorized as either real, financial, or intangible
* *Real assets*. Physical assets drawing their value from substances or properties
    * *Examples*. Precious metals, land, real estate, and commodities like soybeans, wheat, oil, and iron
    * *Definition from Khan academy*. A claim on a tangible object that gives the owner the right to use it as they wish
        * *Reference*. https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/ap-macroeconomics/ap-financial-sector/financial-assets-ap/a/lesson-summary-financial-assets
*  *Intangible assets*. Valuable property, which is not physical in nature
      * *Examples*. They include patents, trademarks, and intellectual property.
* *Financial assets*. In-between the other two assets
    * *Financial assets and intangible assets*. Financial assets may seem intangible with only the stated value on a piece of paper, e.g. a dollar bill or a listing on a computer screen
        * *Representation of financial assets*. What that paper or listing represents is 
            * A claim of ownership of an entity, e.g. a public company (share), or
            * Contractual rights to payments, e.g. the interest income from a bond
        * *Consequence*. Financial assets derive their value from a contractual claim on an underlying asset
    * *Definition from Khan academy*. A contractual claim to something of value
        * *Main types of financial assets*. Bank deposits, stocks, bonds, and loans
    * *Asset underlying financial assets*. May be either real or intangible
        * *Examples*.
            * Commodities are the real, underlying assets pinned to financial assets as commodity futures, contracts, or some exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
            * Real estate is the real asset associated with shares of real estate investment trusts (REITs)
                
                $\to$ REITs are financial assets and are publicly traded entities that own a portfolio of properties

**Financial asset report**. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires businesses to report financial and real assets together as tangible assets for tax purposes

>**NOTE**. The grouping of tangible assets is separate from intangible assets

**Types of financial assets as given by IAS**.
* Cash
* An equity instrument of another entity
* A contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from another entity
* A contractual right to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under particular conditions, or

* *Explain*. An implement, with which to store or transfer value or financial obligations
* *Examples*. 
    * Any asset purchased by an investor can be considered a financial instrument
    * Antique furniture, wheat, and corporate bonds are all equally considered investing instruments
        * *Explain*. They can all be bought and sold as things holding and producing value
    * Debt or equity represent a share of liability, i.e. a future repayment of debt, or ownership
* *Conclusion*. An instrument, in essence, is a type of contract or medium that serves as a vehicle for an exchange of some value between parties
