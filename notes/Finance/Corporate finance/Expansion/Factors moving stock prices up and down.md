# Factors moving stock prices up and down
## EPS and P/E ratio
**Preferred stock**. Shares of a company's stock with dividends paid out to shareholders before common stock dividends are issued

>**NOTE**. If the company enters bankruptcy, preferred stockholders are entitled to be paid from company assets before common stockholders

* *Preferred dividends*. Dividends accrued paid on a company's preferred stock
    * *Dividend rate*. Most preference shares have a fixed dividend, while common stocks generally do not
* *Voting right*. Preferred stock shareholders also typically do not hold any voting rights, but common shareholders usually do

### EPS
**Earning per share (EPS)**. Calculated as a company's profit divided by the outstanding shares of its common stock
* *Interpretation*. An indicator of a company's profitability

    $\to$ The higher a company's EPS, the more profitable it is considered to be

**Formulation**.
* *Basic formulation*.

    $$\text{EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{End-of-period Common Shares Outstanding}}$$

* *Formulation with preferred dividends*.

    $$\text{EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income} - \text{Preferred Dividends}}{\text{End-of-period Common Shares Outstanding}}$$

    * *Explain*.
        * Corporations are not obligated to pay common stock dividends, even if they are doing well
        * Preferred shareholders usually receive quarterly or monthly preferred dividends
* *Weighted average number of common shares*. It is more accurate to use a weighted average number of common shares over the reporting term
    * *Explain*. The number of shares can change over time
    * *Formula*. 

        $$\text{Common Shares Outstanding} = \sum_{i} \text{Duration-Proportion}_i \cdot \text{Outstanding-Share}_i$$

    * *Revised EPS*. The EPS for the year is calculated as earnings divided by the weighted average number of shares

**Usage**.
* One of the most important metrics to determine a firm's profitability on an absolute basis
* A major component of calculating P/E valuation ratio, where the E in P/E refers to EPS
* By dividing a company's share price by its earnings per share
    
    $\to$ We can see the value of a stock, in terms of how much the market is willing to pay for each dollar of earnings
* One of the many indicators you could use to pick stocks

**Comparison of EPS in absolute terms**. May not have much meaning to investors
* *Explain*. Ordinary shareholders do not have direct access to the earnings
* *Proper comparison method*. Compare EPS with the share price of the stock
    * *Purpose*. Determine the value of earnings and how investors feel about future growth

**Reference**. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp

### Price-to-earning (P/E) ratio
**Price-to-earning (P/E) ratio**. The ratio for valuing a company, which measures its current share price relative to its EPS
* *Other names*. Price multiple, or earnings multiple
* *Usage*.
    * Determine the relative value of a company's shares in an apples-to-apples comparison
    * Compare a company against its own historical record
    * Compare aggregate markets against one another or over time
* *Estimation method*. P/E may be estimated on a trailing (backward-looking) or forward (projected) basis
    * *Formula*.

        $$\text{P/E Ratio}=\frac{\text{Market value per share}}{\text{Earnings per share}}$$

**Investor expectations**.
* *High P/E*. Investors are expecting higher earnings growth in the future, compared to companies with a lower P/E
* *Low P/E*. 
    * A company may currently be undervalued, or
    * A company is doing exceptionally well relative to its past trends
* *N/A P/E*. When a company has no earnings or is posting losses, in both cases
    
    $\to$ The P/E will be expressed as N/A

>**NOTE**. Though it is possible to calculate a negative P/E, this is not the common convention

**Median P/E**. The price-to-earnings ratio is a means of standardizing the value of $1 of earnings throughout the stock market
* *Standardized P/E ratio*. By taking the median of P/E ratios over a period of several years
    
    $\to$ One could formulate something of a standardized P/E ratio
* *Usage*. Used as a benchmark and used to indicate whether or not a stock is worth buying

**Reference**. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp

## Factors moving stock price
**Factors moving stock price**.
* *Stock price*. Determined in the marketplace, where seller supply meets buyer demand
    * *Formulation of stock price*. There is no clean equation describing how the price of a stock will behave
* *Fundamental factors*. In an efficient market, stock prices would be determined primarily by fundamentals
    * *Basis factors*.
        * An earning base, e.g. earnings per share (EPS)
        * A valuation multiple, e.g. price-to-earning (P/E) ratio
    * *Explain*. 
        * *EPS*. An owner of common stock has a claim on earnings
            
            $\to$ EPS is the owner's return on their investment
        * *P/E ratio*. Buying a stock means purchasing a proportional share of an entire future stream of earnings
            
            $\to$ P/E ratio is the price we are willing to pay for the future stream of earnings
* *Distribution of earnings*. 
    * Part of these earnings may be distributed as dividends
    * The other part  will be retained by the company, on our behalf, for reinvestment
* *Conclusion*. The future earnings stream is a function of the current level of earnings and the expected growth in this earnings base

**Earnings base**. Despite of using EPS, an accounting measure, to illustrate the concept of earnings base

$\to$ There are other measures of earnings power
* *Cash flow as earnings base measurement*. Free cash flow per share is used as an alternative measure of earnings power
* *Determination of earnings base metric*. The way earnings power is measured may also depend on the type of company being analyzed
    
    $\to$ Many industries have their own tailored metrics
    * *Examples*. 
        * Real estate investment trusts (REITs) use funds from operations (FFO)
        * Relatively mature companies are often measured by dividends per share, i.e. what the shareholder actually receives

**Valuation multiple**. Express expectations about the future, i.e. it is fundamentally based on the discounted present value of the future earnings stream
* *Key factors*.
    * The expected growth in the earnings base
        * *Explain*. A higher growth rate will earn the stock a higher multiple
    * The discount rate, i.e. used to calculate the present value of the future stream of earnings
        * *Explain*. A higher discount rate will earn a lower multiple
* *Discount rate decisive factors*.
    * Perceived risk
        * *Explain*. A riskier stock earns a higher discount rate, which, in turn, earns a lower multiple
    * Inflation, or interest rates
        * *Explain*. Higher inflation earns a higher discount rate, which earns a lower multiple
            
            $\to$ The future earnings are going to be worth less in inflationary environments

**Summary**. The key fundamental factors are as follows:
* The level of the earnings base represented by measures such as EPS, cash flow per share, dividends per share
* The expected growth in the earnings base
* The discount rate, which is itself a function of inflation
* The perceived risk of the stock

**Technical factors**. The mix of external conditions, which alter the supply and demand for a company's stock
* Inflation
* Economic strength of market and peers
* Substitutes, i.e. companies compete for investment dollars with other asset classes on a global stage
* Incidental transactions, i.e. purchases or sales of a stock that are motivated by something other than belief in the intrinsic value of the stock
    * *Examples*. Insider transactions, institution buying or shorting a stock to hedge some other investment, etc.
* Demographics
* Trends
* Liquidity
* News
* Market sentiment

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Free cash flow (FCF)**. The cash a company generates after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and maintain its capital assets
* *Interpretation*. A measure of profitability 
    * Excluding the non-cash expenses of the income statement
    * Including spending on equipment and assets, as well as changes in working capital from the balance sheet
    
    >**NOTE**. Interest payments are excluded from the generally accepted definition of free cash flow
* *References*. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freecashflow.asp

**Free cash flow per share (FCFPS)**.
* *References*. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freecashflowpershare.asp

**Present discounted value (PDV)**. The amount we should be willing to pay in the present for a stream of expected future payments
* *Usage*. Calculate appropriate prices for stocks and bonds

**Discounted cash flow (DCF)**. A valuation method used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows
* *DCF analysis*. Estimate the value of an investment today, based on projections of how much money it will generate in the future
    * *Usage*. For investment decisions, company acquisition, etc.
* *Formula*.
    * *Assumptions*.
        * $\text{CF}_n$ is the cash flow for year $n$
        * $r$ is the discount rate
    * *DCF*.

        $$\text{DCF}=\frac{\text{CF}_1}{1+r} + \frac{\text{CF}_2}{1+r^2} + \frac{\text{CF}_n}{1+r^n}$$

* *Interpretation*. The purpose of DCF analysis is to estimate the money an investor would receive from an investment, adjusted for the time value of money
    * *Time value of money*. A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow, i.e. it can be invested
        
        $\to$ A DCF analysis is appropriate in any situation wherein a person is paying money in the present with expectations of receiving more money in the future
    * *Example*. Consider a 5% annual interest rate
        * $1 in a savings account will be worth $1.05 in a year. 
        * If a $1 payment is delayed for a year, its present value is 95 cents
            * *Explain*. We cannot transfer it to your savings account to earn interest
    * *Conequence*. DCF analysis finds the present value of expected future cash flows using a discount rate $r$

        $\to$ If the value calculated through DCF is higher than the current cost of the investment, the opportunity should be considered
* *Conduction of DCF analysis*.
    1. Estimate the future cash flows and the ending value of the investment, equipment, or other assets
    2. Determine an appropriate discount rate for the DCF model, which will vary depending on the project or investment under consideration, e.g. 
        * The company or investor's risk profile
        * The conditions of the capital markets
    
    >**NOTE**. If the investor cannot access the future cash flows, or the project is very complex
    >
    >$\to$ DCF will not have much value and alternative models should be employed

**Discount rate**. Defined depending upon the context
* *Definition 1*. The interest rate charged to commercial banks and other financial institutions for short-term loans they take from the Federal Reserve Bank
* *Definition 2*. The interest rate used in discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis to determine the present value of future cash flows

**Growth rates**. The percentage of change of a specific variable within a specific time period
* *Growth rates for investor*. The compounded annualized rate of growth of a company's revenues, earnings, dividends, or even macro concepts, e.g. GDP and retails sales
