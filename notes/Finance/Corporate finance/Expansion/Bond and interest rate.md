# Bond and interest rate
## Overnight market
**Overnight loans**. 
* *Overnight loans*. A loan that a bank makes to another bank for a short period of time
    * *Explain*.  Lenders agree to lend borrowers funds only "overnight"
        
        $\to$ The borrower must repay the borrowed funds plus interest at the start of business the next day
    * *Purposes*. Help depository institutions access short-term financing to meet unexpected obligations and overcome their liquidity shortfalls
* *"Overnight"*. Indicate that the cash borrowed is repaid the following day

**Overnight rate**. The interest rate charged in the overnight market

$\to$ Given the short period of the loan, the overnight rate is the lowest rate, at which banks lend money
* *Overseeing the overnight rate*. In most countries, lending rates are overseen by the central bank
    * *Explain*. Commonly, the central bank sets a target rate or a target range for the rate
* *Enforcement of overnight rate*. Central banks cannot force depository institutions operating under their jurisdiction to charge exactly the target rate in their overnight lending activities
    
    $\to$ The rates are set by the banks participating in the overnight market
* *Encouragement of overnight rate*. The central bank may encourage depository institutions to follow the interest rates within the target range through open market operations, e.g.
    * The central bank may start purchasing government bonds from the banks
        
        $\to$ This injects more cash into the economy and lowers the rate
    * If the central bank aims to increase the target rate
        
        $\to$ It may initiate a sale of government-issued securities to artificially create a liquidity shortage

**Motivation**. 
* *Needs for overnight loans*. Banks and financial institutions analyse their cash reserves on a daily basis
    
    $\to$ Banks then assess whether they have an excess or a deficit of cash w.r.t their needs
    * If the forecast is that the institutions' clients will need more money over the course of the day than the institution has on hand
        
        $\to$ The institution will borrow money on the market that day
    * If the analyst projects that the institution will have surplus money on hand beyond that needed by its clients that day
        
        $\to$ It will lend money on the overnight market that day
* *How overnight loans are feasible*. Consider the case where there is a central bank, and only two other banks
    * *Explain*. Suppose that nobody withdraw cash from any bank
        
        $\to$ The bank system is a closed system, i.e. total cash outflows equal to the cash inflows
        * *Consequence*. Overnight loans is just a prior re-distribution of cash, before transactions are verified successfully and cash transfers between banks are finished
* *Requirements for overnight loans*. 
    * Each bank must maintain the reserve requirements set by the central bank
        * *Reserve requirements*. A specified percentage of the bank’s deposits, whichcannot be used in its lending activities
            
            $\to$ The funds must be set aside and kept in cash, or on the account within the central bank
        * *Purposes of reserve requirements*. Ensure that the banking system remains stable and liquid
    * Only the creditworthy banks and institutions can trade, since the interest rates are very low in the overnight market

**Overnight rate and monetary policy**. The overnight rate is one of the most important macroeconomic variables

$\to$ Changes in the overnight lending rate may also influence other macroeconomic factors, e.g. unemployment rate, inflation, and economic growth rate
* *Monetary policies*. Central banks manipulate the overnight lending rate to implement their monetary policies
* *Handling slow economic growth rate*. If evidence of slow economic growth emerges
    
    $\to$ The central bank can implement an expansionary monetary policy by bringing the overnight rate down to stimulate growth
    * *Consequences*. 
        * A lower rate implies that the banks can borrow the funds from each other at a lower rate
        * The banks can charge lower interest rates to their customers, making loans more affordable to businesses and individuals
            * *Consequences*.
                * Businesses are able to obtain additional funds for various investment and expansion activities
                * The purchasing power of consumers also increases
* *Handling high economic growth rate*. If a country’s economy is overheated and there are signs of rising inflation
        
    $\to$ The central bank may enforce a contractionary monetary policy by increasing the rate
    * *Consequence*. 
        * The rate hike discourages banks from excessive overnight lending activities
        * The banks will raise interest rates charged to their customers to compensate for the higher overnight rates
            
            $\to$ This leads to a decrease in money circulation in the economy, preventing inflation
            
            >**NOTE**. This also discourages business activities

## Prevailing interest rate
**Prevailing interest rate (or current market rate)**. The average current interest rate in the economy
* *Prevailing interest rate and types of loans*. Different types of loans often have various prevailing rates
    * *Examples*. Since mortgage and car loans use their underlying property as collateral
        
        $\to$ The going interest rate currently offered for these types of loans may be a couple of percentage points lower than interest on a personal loan without collateral

**History**. Prevailing interest rates in the United States originate with the federal funds rate
* *Explain*. This interest rate, set by the Federal Reserve, is what banks pay for overnight loans
    
    $\to$ Through adjusting this rate up and down, the Fed attempts to control the U.S. money supply
* *Example*. An excess of available funds generally means the interest rate will decline
    
    $\to$ When demand outpaces supply, the funds rate increases

**Effects on consumers**. When a bank needs more reserves than it has on hand

$\to$ It borrows from banks that have more than they need to meet obligations

>**NOTE**. This type of borrowing and lending goes on constantly through the federal funds market

* *Earning to pay loans*. Banks having overnight loans need to make a profit

    $\to$ To recoup what they pay in the federal funds rate and make a profit, the rate is adjusted upward and passed on to consumers
    
    >**NOTE**. This funds rate also affects earnings on investments

## Bond and interest rate
**Bond**. Owning a bond is essentially like possessing a stream of future cash payments
* *Payment method*. Periodic interest payments and the return of principal when the bond matures
* *Value of bonds*. Without credit risk, the value of that stream of future cash payments is a function of our required return based on oue inflation expectations

### Measures of risk
**Interest rate risk**. The risk of changes in a bond's price due to changes in prevailing interest rates

$\to$ Changes in short-term versus long-term interest rates can affect various bonds in different ways

**Credit risk**. The risk that the issuer of a bond will not make scheduled interest or principal payments

$\to$ The probability of a negative credit event or default affects a bond's price

### Calculation of bond's yield and price
**Bond's YTM**. The discount rate, which can be used to make the present value of all of a bond's cash flows equal to its price
* *Explain*. A bond's price is the sum of the present value of each cash flow, wherein the present value of each cash flow is calculated using the same discount factor

    $\to$ This discount factor is the yield
* *Consequence*. 
    * When a bond's yield rises, by definition, its price falls
    * When a bond's yield falls, by definition, its price increases

**Bond's relative yield**. The longer the term to maturity, the higher the yield will be

### Inflation expectations determine the investor's yield requirements
**Inflation as a bond's worst enemy**. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of a bond's future cash flows
* *Consequence*. Since bonds are typically fixed-rate investments
    
    $\to$ If inflation is increasing, the return on a bond is reduced in real terms, i.e. adjusted for inflation
    * *Example*. If a bond pays a 4% yield and inflation is 3%, the bond's real rate of return is 1%.

**Inflation rate and yield**. The higher the current rate of inflation and the higher the expected future rates of inflation

$\to$ The higher the yields will rise across the yield curve
* *Explain*. Investors will demand a higher yield to compensate for inflation risk

### Short-tem, long-tem interest rate, and inflation expectations
**Brief**. Inflation and expectations of future inflation are a function of the dynamics between short-term and long-term interest rates
* *Short-term interest rates*. Administered by nations' central banks
* *Long-term interest rates*. Central banks do not control long-term interest rates
    
    $\to$ Market forces, i.e. supply and demand, determine equilibrium pricing for long-term bonds, which set long-term interest rates
    * If the bond market believes that the interest rate too low
    
        $\to$ Expectations of future inflation increase, i.e. long-term interest rates increase relative to short-term interest rates
        * *Consequence*. The yield curve steepens
    * If the market believes that the interest rate too high
        
        $\to$ The opposite happens, and long-term interest rates decrease relative to short-term interest rates
        * *Consequence*. The yield curve flattens

### Timing of a bond's cash flows and interest rates
**Timing of a bond's cash flows and interest rates**. This includes the bond's term to maturity
* *Idea*. If market participants believe that there is higher inflation on the horizon
    
    $\to$ Interest rates and bond yields will rise, and prices will decrease, to compensate for the loss of the purchasing power of future cash flows
* *Consequence*. Bonds with the longest cash flows will see their yields rise and prices fall the most
