# More shortcuts - Growing perpetuities and annuities
## Growing perpetuities
**Brief**. We often have to value a stream of cash flows growing at a constant rate

**Growing perpetuities**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $g$ is the growth rate in costs
* *Present value of growing perpetuities*.

    $$\begin{aligned}
    \text{PV}&=\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{C}{(1+r)^i}\\
    &=\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{C_1 g^{i-1}}{(1+r)^i}
    \end{aligned}$$

* *Simpler formula*. If $r > g$ holds, then

    $$\text{PV}=\frac{C_1}{r-g}$$

## Growing annuities
**Problem of interest**. Calculate the present value of a stream of growing payments
* *Formula*.

    $$\begin{aligned}
    \text{PV of growing annuity} &= C\times \sum_{i=1}^t \frac{(1+g)^i}{(1+r)^i}\\
    &= C \times \frac{1}{r-g} \bigg[1 - \frac{(1+g)^t}{(1+r)^t}\bigg]
    \end{aligned}$$
