# Looking for shortcuts — Perpetuities and annuities
## How to value perpetuities
**Brief**. Sometimes there are shortcuts that make it easy to calculate present values

**Consols (perpetuitive bonds)**.
* *History*. On occasion, the British and the French have been known to disagree and sometimes even to fight wars
    
    $\to$ At the end of some of these wars the British consolidated the debt they had issued during the war
* *Consols*. The securities issued in such cases, which are perpetuities
    * *Explain*. Consols are bonds that the government is under no obligation to repay but that offer a fixed income for each year to perpetuity
* *Annual rate of return on a perpetuity*. Equal to the promised annual payment divided by the present value

    $$\text{Return} = \frac{\text{cash flow}}{\text{present value}}$$

    or formally

    $$r=C/\text{PV}$$

    * *Proof*. The equation can be derived from the formula

        $$\text{PV}&=\sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{C_i}{(1+r)^i}$$

**Warnings**. Two warnings about the perpetuity formula
* At a quick glance you can easily confuse the formula with the present value of a single payment
    * *Explain*. 
        * A payment of $1 at the end of one year has a present value of $1/(1 + r)$
        * The perpetuity has a value of $1/r$, which is different
* The perpetuity formula tells us the value of a regular stream of payments starting one period from now

**Delayed perpetuity**. Sometimes we may need to calculate the value of a perpetuity, which does not start to make payments for several years

$\to$ The initial value would be proportional to the discounted amount, rather than the amount we lended intially
* *Formal*.

    $$\text{PV} = \frac{C}{r} \cdot \frac{1}{(1+r)^t}$$

    where $t$ denotes the delay times

## How to value annuities
**Annuity**. An asset paying a fixed sum each year for a specified number of years
* *Examples*. Equal-payment house mortgage, installment credit agreement, or interest payments on most bonds
* *Evaluating an annuity*. 
    * *Option 1*. Calculate the value of each cash flow and finding the total
    * *Option 2*. Given an interest rate $r$, the present value of an annuity paying $ $C$ a period for each of $t$ periods is

        $$\text{Present value of t-year annuity} = C \bigg[ \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{r(1+r)^t} \bigg]$$

* *Annuity factor*. $\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{r(1+r)^t}$
    * *Interpretation*. The present value of $1 a year for each of $t$ years

The expression in brackets shows the present value of $1 a year for each of t years. It is
generally known as the t-year annuity factor.
If you are wondering where this formula comes from, look at Figure 2.7. It shows the payments and values of three investments.
Row 1 The investment in the first row provides a perpetual stream of $1 starting at the end
of the first year. We have already seen that this perpetuity has a present value of 1/r.
Row 2 Now look at the investment shown in the second row of Figure 2.7. It also provides
a perpetual stream of $1 payments, but these payments don’t start until year 4. This stream of
payments is identical to the payments in row 1, except that they are delayed for an additional
three years. In year 3, the investment will be an ordinary perpetuity with payments starting in
one year and will therefore be worth 1/r in year 3. To find the value today, we simply multiply
this figure by the three-year discount factor. Thus,
PV = __ 1
r
× _______ 1
(1 + r)3
Row 3 Finally, look at the investment shown in the third row of Figure 2.7. This provides a
level payment of $1 a year for each of three years. In other words, it is a three-year annuity.
You can also see that, taken together, the investments in rows 2 and 3 provide exactly the same
cash payments as the investment in row 1. Thus the value of our annuity (row 3) must be equal
to the value of the row 1 perpetuity less the value of the delayed row 2 perpetuity:
Present value of a 3-year annuity of $1 a year = __ 1
r
–
1
________
r(1 + r)3
Remembering formulas is about as difficult as remembering other people’s birthdays. But as
long as you bear in mind that an annuity is equivalent to the difference between an immediate
and a delayed perpetuity, you shouldn’t have any difficulty.5
