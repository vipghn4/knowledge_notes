# Looking for shortcuts — Perpetuities and annuities
## How to value perpetuities
**Brief**. Sometimes there are shortcuts that make it easy to calculate present values

**Consols (perpetuitive bonds)**.
* *History*. On occasion, the British and the French have been known to disagree and sometimes even to fight wars
    
    $\to$ At the end of some of these wars the British consolidated the debt they had issued during the war
* *Consols*. The securities issued in such cases, which are perpetuities
    * *Explain*. Consols are bonds that the government is under no obligation to repay but that offer a fixed income for each year to perpetuity
* *Annual rate of return on a perpetuity*. Equal to the promised annual payment divided by the present value

    $$\text{Return} = \frac{\text{cash flow}}{\text{present value}}$$

    or formally

    $$r=C/\text{PV}$$

    * *Proof*. The equation can be derived from the formula

        $$\text{PV}&=\sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{C_i}{(1+r)^i}$$

**Warnings**. Two warnings about the perpetuity formula
* At a quick glance you can easily confuse the formula with the present value of a single payment
    * *Explain*. 
        * A payment of $1 at the end of one year has a present value of $1/(1 + r)$
        * The perpetuity has a value of $1/r$, which is different
* The perpetuity formula tells us the value of a regular stream of payments starting one period from now

**Delayed perpetuity**. Sometimes we may need to calculate the value of a perpetuity, which does not start to make payments for several years

$\to$ The initial value would be proportional to the discounted amount, rather than the amount we lended intially
* *Formal*.

    $$\text{PV} = \frac{C}{r} \cdot \frac{1}{(1+r)^t}$$

    where $t$ denotes the delay times

## How to value annuities
**Annuity**. An asset paying a fixed sum each year for a specified number of years
* *Examples*. Equal-payment house mortgage, installment credit agreement, or interest payments on most bonds
* *Evaluating an annuity*. 
    * *Option 1*. Calculate the value of each cash flow and finding the total
    * *Option 2*. Given an interest rate $r$, the present value of an annuity paying $ $C$ a period for each of $t$ periods is

        $$\text{Present value of t-year annuity} = C \bigg[ \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{r(1+r)^t} \bigg]$$

* *Annuity factor*. 

    $$\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{(1+r)^i}=\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{r(1+r)^t}$$
    
    * *Interpretation*. The present value of $1 a year for each of $t$ years

## Valuing annuities due
**Annuity due**. A level stream of payments starting immediately
* *Value of annuity due*. Worth $(1+r)$ times the value of an ordinary annuity

**Example**. Winning big at the lottery
* *Scenario*. In May 2013, an 84-year-old woman invested $10 in five Powerball lottery tickets and won a record $590.5 million
    * The prize was to be paid in 30 equal annual installments of $19.683 million each
    * The first payment occurred at the end of one year
    * The interest rate at the time was about 3.6%.
* *Conclusion*. We could fairly point out that the prize was not really worth $590.5 million
* *Vartion*. If the first of the 30 yearly payments was made immediately. 

    $\to$ We discount each cash flow by one less year, the present value is increased by the multiple $(1 + r)$

## Calculating annual payments
**Brief**. In practice, annuity problems are generally straightforward
* *Example*. We may use the annuity formula to find the amount of the payment given the present value

**Example**. Bank loans are paid off in equal installments
* *Scenario*.
    * We take out a four-year loan of $1,000
    * The bank requires us to repay the loan evenly over the four years
        
        $\to$ It must therefore set the four annual payments to yield a present value of $1,000
* *Formal*.

    $$\begin{aligned}
    \text{PV} = \text{annual loan payment} \times \text{4-year annuity factor} = 1,000\\
    \text{Annual loan payment} = 1,000/\text{4-year annuity factor}
    \end{aligned}$$

**Amortizing loans**. Loans involving a series of level payments
* *"Amortizing"*. 
    * Part of the regular payment is used to pay interest on the loan
    * Part is used to reduce the amount of the loan

## Future value of an annuity
**Brief**. Sometimes we need to calculate the future value of a level stream of payments

**Future value of a level stream of cash flows of $1 a year for $t$ years**.

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Future value of annuity} &= \text{Present value of annuity of \$1 a year} \times (1+r)^t\\
&=\bigg[ \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{r(1+r)^t} \bigg]\times (1+r)^t\\
&=\frac{(1+r)^t - 1}{r}
\end{aligned}$$

* *Consequence*. If we can find the present value of any series of cash flows
    
    $\to$ We can always calculate future value by multiplying by $(1 + r)^t$

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Level payment mortgage**. A type of mortgage requiring the same dollar payment each month or payment period

$\to$ Borrowers know exactly how much they will have to pay on their mortgages each pay period
