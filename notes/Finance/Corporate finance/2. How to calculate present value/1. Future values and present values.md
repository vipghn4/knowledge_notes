# Future values and present values
## Introduction
**Brief**. All financial decisions require comparisons of cash
payments at different dates

$\to$ We need to understand the relationship between the values of dollars today and dollars in the future

## Calculating future values
**Brief**. Money can be invested to earn interest
* *Consequence*. If we are offered the choice between $100 today
and $100 next year

    $\to$ We naturally take the money now to get a year’s interest 
* *Basic principle of finance*. A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow
* *Investment trade-off*. By investing, we give up the opportunity to spend the money today
    
    $\to$ we gain the chance to spend more money next year
    * *Assumptions*.
        * $P$ is the principal cash
        * $i$ is the nominal annual interest rate in percentage terms
        * $n$ is the number of compounding periods
    * *Compound rate*. Our wealth grows at a compound rate, i.e. $(1 + i)^n$
    * *Compound interest*. The interest we earn, i.e. total amount of principal and interest in future, less principal amount at present, i.e.
        
        $$A=P (1 + i)^n - P$$

## Calculating present values
**Brief**. How much we need to invest today to produce a certain amount at a certain point of time

$\to$ What is the present value (PV) of the future amount payoff?

**Present value (PV)**. Consider receiving a cash flow of $C_t$ dollars at the end of year $t$

$\to$ The present value of this future payment is

$$\text{PV} = \frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^t}$$

* *Terminology*.
    * *Discount rate*. $r$
    * *Discount factor*. $\frac{1}{(1+r)^t}$

        $\to$ This measures the present value of one dollar received in year $t$
* *Interpretation*. The present value is the discounted value of the cash flow $C_t$
* *Consequence*. The longer we have to wait for our money
    
    $\to$ The lower its present value

## Valuing an investment opportunity
**Brief**. How do we decide whether an investment opportunity is worth undertaking? 

**Rate of return on an investment decision**. Obtained by dividing the expected profit by the required investment

**Example**. Consider a small company contemplating construction of a suburban office block
* *Scenario*.
    * The cost of buying the land and constructing the building is $700,000
        * Our company has cash in the bank to finance construction
    * Our real-estate adviser predicts that we can to sell next year for $800,000
        
        >**NOTE**. For simplicity, we will assume initially that $800,000 is a sure thing
* *Options for financial manager*. 
    * *Option 1*. Invest in the project
        * *Rate of return on the project*. $14.3\%$
    * *Option 2*. Pay cash out to shareholders, who can invest on their own on
        * *Assumed rate of return of safe assets*. $7\%$, i.e. U.S. Treasury debt securities
        * *Assumed rate of return of the stock market*. $12\%$
* *Opportunity cost of capital*. $7\%$
* *Obvious decision of shareholders*. Vote for the investment project
* *Value of the investment to the corporation's wealth*. The project produces a cash flow at the end of one year

    $$\text{PV} = \frac{C_1}{1 + r} = \frac{800,000}{1.07} = 747,664$$

    * *Evaluate the value of a project at present*. Consider selling our project after buying the land and paying for the construction
        
        $\to$ If the venture will return a surefire $800,000, then our property ought to be worth its PV of $747,664 today
        * If we tried to sell it for more than $747,664, there would be no takers
            * *Explain*. The property would then offer an expected rate of return lower than the 7% available on government securities
        * If we sell our property for less, but why sell for less than the market will bear? 
            
            $\to$ The $747,664 present value is the only feasible price that satisfies both buyer and seller
    * *Conclusion*. The present value of the property is also its market price

## Net present value
**Net present value (NPV)**. Equal present value minus the required investment

$\to$ Our investment makes some net contribution to value and changes our wealth
* *Formula*.

    $$NPV = C_0 + C_1/(1 + r)$$

    * *Explain*. $C_0$ is the cash flow at time 0, i.e. today, is usually a negative number, i.e. the amount to invest
        
        $\to$ $C_0$ is an investment and therefore a cash outflow
* *NPV investigation*. When cash flows occur at different points in time
    
    $\to$ It is often helpful to draw a time line showing the date and value of each cash flow

## Risk and present value
**Risk**. No one can be certain about the profitability of an investment, even the best forecast
* *Observations*. 
    * If the cash flows are uncertain
        
        $\to$ Our calculation of NPV is wrong
    * Investors could achieve an equivalent cash flows with certainty by buying $747,664 worth of U.S. government securities

        $\to$ They would not invest in our project for that amount
* *Consequence*. We have to cut our asking price to attract investors’ interest

**Second basic financial principle**. A safe dollar is worth more than
a risky dollar
* *Explain*. Most investors dislike risky ventures and will not invest in them unless they see the prospect of a higher return

**Present value and opportunity cost of capital for risk**. We have to
think of expected payoffs and the expected rates of return
* *Motivation*. Not all investments are equally risky
* *Decisive factors of present value*. The timing of the cash flows and
their risk

## Present values and rates of return
**Evaluate a project for investment**. To discover how much a project is worth

$\to$ We asked how much you would need to invest directly in securities to achieve the same payoff
* *Consequence*. We discounted the project’s future payoff by the rate of return offered by these equivalent-risk securities
* *Decision rule*. Our project venture is worth undertaking because its rate of return exceeds the opportunity cost of capital

**Rules to justify an investment**.
* *Net present value rule*. Accept investments that have positive net present values
* *Rate of return rule*. Accept investments that offer rates of return in excess of their opportunity costs of capital

## Calculating present values when there are multiple cash flows
**Present values w.r.t multiple cash flows**.
* *Observation*. Present values are all expressed in current dollars

    $\to$ We can add them up
    * *Formal*. The present value of cash flow $(A + B)$ is equal to the present value of cash flow A plus the present value of cash flow B

* *Discounted cash flow (or DCF)*. The total present value over a number of years

    $$\text{PV}=\sum_{i=1}^T \frac{C_i}{(1+r)^i}$$

* *Net present value w.r.t DCF*. 

    $$\text{NPV}=C_0 + \text{PV}=C_o + \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t}$$

## The opportunity cost of capital
**Brief**. By investing in an investment project, we give up the opportunity to earn from the stock market

$\to$ This results in the opportunity cost of capital
* *Question of interest*. When discounting the expected cash flows by the opportunity cost of capital
    
    $\to$ We are asking how much investors in the financial markets are prepared to pay for a security, which produces a similar stream of future cash flows
    * *Explain*. Investors will not pay any more than that for our project

**Loan interest rate and project risk**.
* *Scenario*. Consider a bank lending us the $700,000 that you need for the office block at 8%
    
    $\to$ Does this mean that the cost of capital is 8%
* *Observations*.
    * If the loan interest rate means the cost of capital
        
        $\to$ The project would be even more worthwhile
    * However, that cannot be right, i.e.
        * The interest rate on the loan has nothing to do with the risk of the project
            
            $\to$ It reflects the good health of your existing business
        * Whether we take the loan or not, we still face the choice between the office building and an equally risky investment in the stock market
