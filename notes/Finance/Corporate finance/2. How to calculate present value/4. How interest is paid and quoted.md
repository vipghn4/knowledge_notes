# How interest is paid and quoted
**Effective annual interest rate**.
* *Motivating problem*.
    * In France and Germany the government pays interest on its bonds annually
    * In the United States and Britain government bonds pay interest semiannually
        * *Explain*. If a U.S. government bond promises to pay interest of 10% a year
            
            $\to$ The investor in practice receives interest of 5% every six months
        * *Explain*.
            * Our wealth will grow to 1.05 × $100 = $105 by the end of six months
            * Our wealth will grow to 1.05 × $105 = $110.25 by the end of the year
        * *Consequence*. An interest rate of 10% compounded semiannually is equivalent to 10.25% compounded annually
* *Effective annual interest rate*. The true interest rate we are given after a certain period of time

**Annual percentage rate (APR)**.
* *Motivating eample*. Consider a bank offers you an automobile loan at an APR of 12% with interest to be paid monthly
    * *Explain*. Each month we need to pay one-twelfth of the annual rate
        
        $\to$ The bank is quoting a rate of 12%
    * *Effective annual interest rate on the loan*. $1.0112 – 1 = .1268$
* *Conclusion*. We need to distinguish between the quoted annual interest rate and the effective annual rate
    * *Quoted annual rate*. Usually calculated as the total annual payment divided by the number of payments in the year
    * *Consequence*. 
        * When interest is paid once a year, the quoted and effective rates are the same
        When interest is paid more frequently, the effective interest rate is higher than the quoted rate
* *Principle*. If we invest $1 at a rate of $r$ per year compounded $m$ times a year
    
    $\to$ Our investment at the end of the year will be worth $[1 + (r/m)]^m$ and the effective interest rate is $[1 + (r/m)]^m – 1$

## Continuous compounding
**Frequency of paying interest**. There is no limit to how frequently interest could be paid
* *Continuous compounding* The interest rate is continuously compounded, i.e. $m$ is infinite
    * *Explain*. The payments are spread evenly and continuously thorughout the year
* *Example*. Conside the option pricing models, e.g. Black–Scholes model, which are continuous time models
    
    $\to$ Most computer programs for calculating option values ask for the continuously compounded interest rate

**Calculation of a continuously compounded interest rate**. 
* *Motivation*.
    
    $$\lim_{m\to\infty} [1 + (r/m)]^m \= e^r$
    
* *Consequence*. 
    * $1 invested at a continuously compounded rate of $r$ will grow to $e^r$ by the end of the first year
    * By the end of $t$ years it will grow to $e^{rt}$


**Continuously compound rate for evenly spreaded cash flow**. Consider a cash flows spreading evenly over the year rather

$\to$ We can adapt our previous formulas to handle this
* *Formal problem*. Compute the present value of a perpetuity of $C$ dollars a year
