# Using the present value formula to value bonds
## Introduction
**Investment cost**. Investment in new plant and equipment requires money
* *Financing an investment*. 
    * *Option 1*. Retain and accumulate earnings to cover the cost of investment
    * *Option 2*. Raise extra cash from investors
* *Borrowing cash*. If the firm chooses not to sell additional shares of stock

    $\to$ The cash has to come from borrowing
    * *Short-term borrowing*. If cash is needed for only a short while
        
        $\to$ Firms may borrow from a bank
    * *Long-term borrowing*. If cash is needed for long-term investments
        
        $\to$ Firms generally issue bonds, i.e. long-term loans
* *Examples*. Companies, municipalities, or national governments may raise money by selling bonds

>**NOTE**. Do not confuse government bond interest rate with the cost of capital for a corporation
>
>* *Explain*. The projects undertaken by companies are almost invariably risky and investors demand higher prospective returns from these
projects than from safe government bonds

**Bond trading**. Most bonds can be sold by the initial bondholder to other investors after they have been issued

$\to$ A bond investor does not have to hold a bond all the way through to its maturity date
* *Purchase of bonds by borrower*. It is common for bonds to be repurchased by the borrower if
    * Interest rates decline, or
    * The borrower’s credit has improved, and it can reissue new bonds at a lower cost

**Bond market**. The bond markets are sophisticated
* *Explain*. Bond traders make massive trades motivated by tiny price discrepancies
* *Qualified financial managers and bonds*. 
    * Managers must understand the bond pages in the financial press
    * Managers must know what bond dealers mean when they quote spot rates or yields to maturity
    * Managers must realize why short-term rates are usually lower, but sometimes higher, than long-term rates
    * Managers must realize why the longest-term bond prices are most sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates
    * Managers must be able to distinguish real, i.e. inflation-adjusted, interest rates and nominal, i.e. money, rates
    * Managers must anticipate how future inflation can affect interest rates

**Company bond interest rate**. Companies can’t borrow at the same low interest rates as governments
* *Explain*. Corporate bonds are more complex securities than
government bonds
    * It is more likely that a corporation may be unable to come up with the money to pay its debts

        $\to$ Investors have to worry about default risk
    * Corporate bonds are less liquid than government bonds
        * *Explain*. They are not as easy to buy or sell, particularly in large quantities or on short notice
    * These complications affect the “spread” of corporate bond rates over interest rates on government bonds of similar maturities
* *Government interest rates as a benchmark*. The interest rates on government bonds are benchmarks for all interest rates
    * *Explain*. When government interest rates go up or down
        
        $\to$ Corporate rates follow more or less proportionally
* *Consequence*. Financial managers had better understand how the government rates are determined and what happens when they change

## A short trip to Paris to value a government bond
**Brief**. This section considers once-a-year bond interest payments

**Bond basics**.
* *Bond issuance*. When a bond is issued, the issuing entity determines 
    * Its duration
    * Face value, i.e. par value
    * The rate of interest it pays, i.e. its coupon rate
    
    >**NOTE**. These characteristics are fixed, remaining unaffected by changes in the bond's market

* *Bond interest payoff*. If we own a bond, we are entitled to a fixed set of cash payoffs, i.e.
    * Every year until the bond matures
        
        $\to$ We collect regular interest payments
    * At maturity, when we get the final interest payment
        
        $\to$ We also get back the face value of the bond, i.e. the bond’s principal

**Bond's coupon**. Bonds used to come with coupons attached, which had to be clipped off and presented to the issuer to obtain the interest payments

>**NOTE**. This is still the case with bearer bonds, where the only evidence of indebtedness is the bond itself

* *Anonymous and registered bonds*.
    * *Anonymous*. In many parts of the world, bearer bonds are still issued and are popular with investors who would rather remain anonymous

        $\to$ Bond holder uses coupons to receive interest payment
    * *Registered bonds*. The identity of the bond’s owner is recorded 
        
        $\to$ The coupon payments are sent automatically
* *Example*. Consider French government bonds, known as OATs
    * *Scenario*. In October 2014 we buy €100 face value of the 4.25% OAT maturing in October 2018
        
        $\to$ Each year until the bond matures, we are entitled to an interest payment of .0425 × 100 = €4.25
    * *Bond's coupon*. The annual interest  payment of €4.25

**Present value of bond payments**. 
* *Present value of bond payments*. Depend on the opportunity cost of capital

    $\to$ Opportunity cost of capital is the rate of return offered by other government debt issues
    * *Explain*. Such rate of return is what we are giving up when buying the 4.25% OATs
* *Example*. Suppose other medium-term French government bonds offered a
return of just .15%

    $$\text{PV}=\sum_{i=1}^3 \frac{4.25}{1.0015^i} + \frac{104.25}{1.0015^4}=116.34$$

* *Bond prices expression*. Bond prices are usually expressed as a percentage of face value
    * *Example*. The price of some 4.25% OAT was quoted as 116.34%
* *Conclusion*. The bond can be valued as a package of an annuity, i.e. the coupon payments, and a single, final payment, i.e. the repayment of principal

**Bond's yield to maturity (YTM)**. How much money one would make by buying a bond and holding it for one year
* *Motivation*.
    * *Profits from holding a bond until maturity*. The investor can earn additional interest by reinvesting annual coupon payments
    * *Questions of interest*. If the price of the OAT is 116.34%
        * What is the interest rate?
        * What return do investors get if they buy the bond and hold it to maturity?
* *Bond's YTM*. Determined by solving the PV equation
    * *Example*. In case of French government bond above
        * *Equation to solve*. We need to solve the following equation for the YTM $y$

            $$116.34 = \sum_{i=1}^3 \frac{4.25}{(1+y)^i} + \frac{104.25}{(1+y)^4}$$

        * *Conclusion*. YTM is the rate of return of the offered by other government debt issues, given the present value of the bond
* *Interpretation*. By buying the OAT, we are paying for a €116.34 for a bond with a face value of only €100, hence
    * We lose the difference of €16.34 if you hold the bond to maturity
    * We get four annual cash payments of €4.25

        $\to$ The immediate, current yield on the investment is 4.25/116.34 = .0365, or 3.65%
* *Conclusion*. The yield to maturity blends the return from the coupon payments with the declining value of the bond over its remaining life

**Premium and dicount sales of bonds**.
* *Premium sale*. A bond priced above its face value is said to sell at a premium
    
    $\to$ Investors buying a bond at a premium face a capital loss over the life of the bond
    * *Consequence*. The yield to maturity on these bonds is always less than the current yield
* *Discount sale*. A bond priced below face value sells at a discount

    $\to$ Investors in discount bonds look forward to a capital gain over the life of the bond
    * *Consequence*. The yield to maturity on a discount bond is greater than the current yield

**General procedure for calculating the YTM**. Use trial and error
* *Procedure*.
    1. Guess at an interest rate and calculate the present value of the bond’s payments
    2. If the present value is greater than the actual price
        
        $\to$ Our discount rate must have been too low
        * *Consequence*. We need to try a higher rate
* *More practical solution*. Use a spreadsheet program or a specially
programmed calculator to calculate the yield

## Back to the U.S. - Semiannual coupons and bond prices
**US governmental bonds**.
* *Types of US governmental bonds*. the U.S. Treasury raises money by regular auctions of new bond issues
    * *Treasury bonds*. Bonds, which do not mature for 20 or 30 years
    * *Notes*. Bonds, which mature in 10 years or less
    * *Treasury bills*. Short-term debt maturing in a year or less
* *Governmental bond market*. Treasury bonds, notes, and bills traded in the fixed-income market
* *Bond purchase in stock exchange*. We cannot buy Treasury bonds, notes, or bills on the stock exchange
    
    $\to$ They are traded by a network of bond dealers, who quote prices at which they are prepared to buy and sell
    * *Example*. Suppose that in 2014 we decide to buy the some notes of 2017
        1. We phone a broker, who checks the current price on her screen
        2. If we are happy to go ahead with the purchase
        
            $\to$ Our broker contacts a bond dealer and the trade is done

**Present value of US governmental bonds**. We can now repeat the present value calculations that we did for the French government
bond
