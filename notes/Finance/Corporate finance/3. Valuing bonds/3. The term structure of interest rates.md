# The term structure of interest rates
**Brief**.  For many purposes, using a single discount rate $y$ to compute the PV of an asset is a perfectly acceptable approximation

$\to$ However, there are also occasions when short-term interest rates are different from long-term rates

**Term structure of interest rates**. The relationship between short- and long-term interest rates
* *Problems of interest*.
    * How to measure the term structure
    * Why long- and short-term rates differ

**Spot rate**. 
* *Spot rate*. The spot interest rate is the rate of return earned when the investor buys and sells the bond without collecting coupon payments
    
    $\to$ This is extremely common for short-term traders and market makers
* *Spot interest rate for a zero-coupon bond*.

    $$\text{Spot rate} = \bigg(\frac{\text{Face value}}{\text{Current bond price}}\bigg)^\frac{1}{\text{Years to maturity}} - 1$$

    * *Example*. Consider a $1000 zero-coupon bond with two years until maturity, and current price of $925

        $\to$ The spot rate is $(1000/925)^{1/2}-1=0.03975$

* *Interpretation*. Even though a zero-coupon bond does not receive interest payments, it still earns implicit interest
    * *Explain*. The bond price will move toward face value as it approaches maturity
    * *Consequence*. When a bond is bought and sold without making interest payments
        
        $\to$ This price change is the spot interest rate earned by the bondholder
* *Intuition*. Given the face value and the current price of the bond, as well as the years to maturity, we have

    $$\text{Current bond price}\cdot (1 + \text{Spot rate})^{\text{Years to maturity}} = \text{Face value}$$

**Spot rate and yield to maturity (YTM)**.
* *Brief*.
    * *Yield to maturity*. The total rate of return, which will have been earned by a bond when it makes all interest payments and repays the original principal
    * *Spot rate*. The rate of return earned by a bond, when it is bought and sold on the secondary market without collecting interest payments
* *Motivation*. Bonds are fixed-income products that, in most cases, return a regular coupon or interest payment to the investor
    * When an investor buys a bond intending to keep it until its maturity date
        
        $\to$ YTM is the rate that matters
    * If the investor wants to sell the bond on the secondary market
        
        $\to $the spot rate is the crucial number
* *YTM*. A bond's yield to maturity is based on the interest rate the investor would earn from reinvesting every coupon payment
    * *Explain*. The coupons would be reinvested at an average interest rate until the bond reaches its maturity
    * *COnsequence*. 
        * Discount bonds have a yield to maturity higher than the actual coupon rate
        * Premium bonds have a yield to maturity lower than the actual coupon rate
* *Spot rate*. Calculated by finding the discount rate, which makes the PV of a zero-coupon bond equal to its price
    
    $\to$ These are based on future interest rate assumptions
    * *Consequence*. 
        * Spot rates can use different interest rates for different years until maturity
        * Meanwhile, YTM uses an average rate throughout
* *Conclusion*. Spot rates use a more dynamic and potentially more accurate discount factor in a bond's present valuation
