# How bond prices vary with interest rates
**Bond prices and interest rates**. Bond prices and interest rates must move in opposite directions
* *Bond's yield to maturity (YTM)*. Our measure of the interest rate on a bond is defined as the discount rate explaining the bond price
* *Conclusion*.
    * When bond prices fall, interest rates, i.e. YTM, must rise
    * When interest rates rise, bond prices must fall

**Rate of return of a bond**.

$$\text{Rate of return} = \frac{\text{Coupon income} + \text{Price change}}{\text{Investment}}$$

**Effects of interest rate on cash flows**. A change in interest rates has only a modest impact on the value of near-term cash flows but a much greater impact on the value of distant cash flows

$\to$ The price of long-term bonds is affected more by changing interest rates than the price of short-term bonds

## Duration and volatility
**Brief**. What do we mean by “long-term” and “short-term”?

**Motivating example**. Consider two seven-year bonds with face value of $1000 and annual coupon payments, as well as a YTM of 4% per year
* *Scenario*. Annual coupon payments of the two bonds are 3% and 9% respectively
* *Question of interest*. Which bond is the longer-term investment?
* *Observation*. The bonds both have the same final maturity, but the timing of the bonds’ cash payments is not the same
    * *Explain*. The average time to each cash flow is longer in the case of 3s
        * *Explain*. A higher proportion of the cash flows occurs at maturity, when the face value is paid off
    * *Conclusion*. If the YTM on each bond falls to 3%
        
        $\to$ We should invest in the 3s, i.e. due to the longer effective maturity
* *Consequence*. We need a precise measure of the average maturity
    
    $\to$ Such measure could be used to predict the exposure of each bond’s price to fluctuations in interest rates

**Duration (Macaulay duration)**. A measure of the average maturity

**Calculation of duration**. The weighted average of the times to each of the cash payments

* *Times*. The future years 1, 2, 3, etc., extending to the final maturity date, which we call $T$
* *Weight for each year*. The present value of the cash flow received at that time divided by the total present value of the bond
* *Formulation*.

    $$\text{Duration} = \sum_{i=1}^T \frac{i\times \text{PV}(C_i)}{\text{PV}}$$

    * *Explain*. This is a weighted average maturity of cash flows, where 
        * The time of receipt of each payment is weighted by the PV of that payment
        * The denominator is the sum of the weights, which is precisely the price of the bond
    * *Unit of duration*. Year
* *Interpretation*. The weighted average number of years that an investor must maintain a position in the bond until the present value of the bond’s cash flows equals the amount paid for the bond
    * *Explain*. The bond maturity for a zero-coupon bond with the same present value

**Modified duration (or volatility)**. Investors and financial managers track duration since it measures how bond prices change when interest rates change

$\to$ It is best to use modified duration or volatility, i.e. duration divided by one plus the YTM

$$\text{Modified duration} = \text{Volatility (\%)} = \frac{\text{duration}}{1 + \text{yield}}$$

* *Interpretation*. Consider fixing the time-to-maturity of the bond

    $\to$ Modified duration measures the percentage change in bond price for a 1 percentage-point change in yield
* *Modified duration as derivative of bond price w.r.t a change in YTM*. The derivative of the bond price w.r.t a change in YTM is

    $$\frac{d\text{PV}}{dy} = − \frac{\text{duration}}{1 + y} = − \text{modified duration}$$

    * *Consequence*. Modified duration is a good predictor of the effect of interest rate changes only for small moves in interest rates

**Duration and modified duration as a measure of interest risk**. Duration and modified duration is a handy measure of interest-rate risk

$\to$ Financial managers use the measure to protect the pension plan against unexpected changes in interest rates
