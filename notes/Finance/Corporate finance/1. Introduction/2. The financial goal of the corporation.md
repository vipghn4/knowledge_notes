# The financial goal of the corporation
## Shareholders want managers to maximize market value
**Ownership and management**.
* *Problem with too many shareholders*. There is no way that all shareholders can be actively involved in management
    
    $\to$ It is like trying to run New York City by town meetings
    * *Consequence*. Authority has to be delegated to professional managers
* *Making satisfying decisions for shareholders*.
    * *Requirements for operation delegation of a firm*. Shareholders must have a common objective
    * *Natural common objective of shareholders*. Maximize the current market value of shareholders’ investment in the firm
    * *Consequence*. A smart and effective manager makes decisions to 
        * Increas the current value of the company’s shares
        * Increase the wealth of its stockholders

**Financial market and shareholder wealth**. Maximizing shareholder wealth is a sensible goal given well-functioning financial markets
* *Benefits of financial markets*. 
    * Allow shareholders to share risks and transport savings across time
    * Give shareholders the flexibility to manage their own savings and investment plans
* *Consequence*. The corporation’s financial managers only need to increase market value

**Risk tolerance of shareholders**. There are risk-averse and risk-tolerant investors
* *Risk-averse investors*. If the firm is too risky for them
    
    $\to$ They will sell shares of the risky firm and buy shares in a safer one

## A fundamental result
**Brief**. The goal of maximizing shareholder value is widely accepted in both theory and practice

$\to$ It is important to understand why

**Motivation for maximizing shareholder value**.
* *Assumption*. The financial manager acts in the interests of the firm’s owners, its stockholders
* *Desired points of each stockholder*.
    * To be as rich as possible, i.e. to maximize his current wealth
    * To transform his wealth into the most desirable time pattern of consumption
        * *Explain*. Either by borrowing to spend now or investing to spend later
    * To manage the risk characteristics of that consumption plan
* *Shareholders' approach to the best time pattern of consumption*. Stockholders do not need the financial manager’s help to achieve the best time pattern of consumption
    * *Explain*. 
        * They can do that on their own, provided they have free access to competitive financial markets
        * They can choose the risk characteristics of their consumption plan by investing in more- or less-risky securities
* *Helping shareholders to yield their objectives*. There is only one way, i.e. by increasing their wealth
    * *Explain*. Increase the market value of the firm and the current price of its shares
