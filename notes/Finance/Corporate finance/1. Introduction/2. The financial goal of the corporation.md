# The financial goal of the corporation
## Shareholders want managers to maximize market value
**Ownership and management**.
* *Problem with too many shareholders*. There is no way that all shareholders can be actively involved in management
    
    $\to$ It is like trying to run New York City by town meetings
    * *Consequence*. Authority has to be delegated to professional managers
* *Making satisfying decisions for shareholders*.
    * *Requirements for operation delegation of a firm*. Shareholders must have a common objective
    * *Natural common objective of shareholders*. Maximize the current market value of shareholders’ investment in the firm
    * *Consequence*. A smart and effective manager makes decisions to 
        * Increas the current value of the company’s shares
        * Increase the wealth of its stockholders

**Financial market and shareholder wealth**. Maximizing shareholder wealth is a sensible goal given well-functioning financial markets
* *Benefits of financial markets*. 
    * Allow shareholders to share risks and transport savings across time
    * Give shareholders the flexibility to manage their own savings and investment plans
* *Consequence*. The corporation’s financial managers only need to increase market value

**Risk tolerance of shareholders**. There are risk-averse and risk-tolerant investors
* *Risk-averse investors*. If the firm is too risky for them
    
    $\to$ They will sell shares of the risky firm and buy shares in a safer one

## A fundamental result
**Brief**. The goal of maximizing shareholder value is widely accepted in both theory and practice

$\to$ It is important to understand why

**Motivation for maximizing shareholder value**.
* *Assumption*. The financial manager acts in the interests of the firm’s owners, its stockholders
* *Desired points of each stockholder*.
    * To be as rich as possible, i.e. to maximize his current wealth
    * To transform his wealth into the most desirable time pattern of consumption
        * *Explain*. Either by borrowing to spend now or investing to spend later
    * To manage the risk characteristics of that consumption plan
* *Shareholders' approach to the best time pattern of consumption*. Stockholders do not need the financial manager’s help to achieve the best time pattern of consumption
    * *Explain*. 
        * They can do that on their own, provided they have free access to competitive financial markets
        * They can choose the risk characteristics of their consumption plan by investing in more- or less-risky securities
* *Helping shareholders to yield their objectives*. There is only one way, i.e. by increasing their wealth
    * *Explain*. Increase the market value of the firm and the current price of its shares

## Investment trade-off

    <figcaption>Fundamental trade-off for corporate investment decisions</figcaption>
</div>

**Brief**. Consider maximizing market value, why do some investments increase market value, while others reduce it? 

**Fundamental trade-off for corporate investment decisions**. If cash is reinvested, the opportunity cost is the expected rate of return, which shareholders could have obtained by investing in financial assets
* *Scenario*. 
    * The corporation has a proposed investment project, i.e. a real asset
    * The corporation has cash on hand sufficient to finance the project
* *Problem*. The financial manager is trying to decide whether to invest in the project
    * *Explain*. If the financial manager decides not to invest
        
        $\to$ The corporation can pay out the cash to shareholders, as an extra dividend
* *Desiderata of shareholders*. Consider the financial manager acting in the interests of the corporation’s stockholders
    * *Decisive factors*. The desiradata of stockholders depends on
        * The rate of return on the investment project
        * The rate of return that the stockholders can earn by investing in financial markets
    * *Preferrence of shareholders*. 
        * If the investment project offers a higher return than shareholders can achieve on their own
            
            $\to$ The shareholders would vote for the investment project
        * If the investment project offers a lower return than shareholders can achieve on their own
            
            $\to$ The shareholders would vote to cancel the project and take the cash
* *Conclusion*. 
    * If a corporation’s proposed investments offer higher rates of return than its shareholders can earn for themselves in the stock market, or in other financial markets
        
        $\to$ The shareholders will applaud the investments and its stock price will increase
    * If the company earns an inferior return
        
        $\to$ Shareholders boo, stock price falls, and stockholders demand their money back for other investment

**Hurdle rate (or cost of capital)**. The minimum rate of return on a project or investment required by a manager or investor

$\to$ It allows companies to make important decisions
* *Hurdle rate as opportunity cost of capital to investors*. The hurdle rate depends on the investment opportunities available to investors in financial markets
    * *Explain*. Whenever a corporation invests cash in a new project
        
        $\to$ Its shareholders lose the opportunity to invest the cash on their own
* *Maximizing coroporation values*. Corporations increase value by accepting all investment projects that earn more than the opportunity cost of capital
* *Decisive factors*. The opportunity cost of capital depends on the risk of the proposed investment project
    * *Explain*. 
        * Shareholders are risk-averse
        * Shareholders have to trade off risk against return when they invest on their own
    * *Trade-off between risk and return*. 
        * The safest investments offer low rates of return
        * Investments with higher expected rates of return—the stock market
* *Hurdle rate and loan interest rate*. The opportunity cost of capital is generally not the interest rate that the company pays on a loan from a bank
    * *Explain*. 
        * If the company is making a risky investment
            
            $\to$ The opportunity cost is the expected return that investors can achieve in financial markets at the same level of risk
        * The expected return on risky securities is normally well above the interest rate on a bank loan

**Opportunity cost measurement**. Managers look to the financial markets to measure the opportunity cost of capital for the firm’s investment projects
* *Explain*. They can observe the opportunity cost of capital for safe investments by looking up current interest rates on safe debt securities 

>**NOTE**. For risky investments, the opportunity cost of capital has to be estimated

## Should managers look after the interest of their shareholders
**Questions of interest**. 
* Is it desirable for managers to act in the selfish interests of their shareholders? 
* Does a focus on enriching the shareholders mean that managers must act as greedy mercenaries riding roughshod over the weak and helpless?

**Doing well versus doing good**. In most instances, little conflict arises between doing well, i.e. maximizing value, and doing good
* *Doing well and doing good*.
    * *Doing well*. Act in a way to maximize profit
    * *Doing good*. Act in a moral way especially helping out with a charity
* *Explain*.
    * Profitable firms are those with satisfied customers and loyal employees
    * Firms with dissatisfied customers and a disgruntled workforce will probably end up with declining profits and a low stock price
* *Adding values to corporation*. Most established corporations can add value by 
    * Building long-term relationships with their customers
    * Establishing a reputation for fair dealing and financial integrity
        
        >**NOTE**. When something happens to undermine that reputation, the costs can be enormous

**Clarification of corporation objective**. When saying that the objective of the firm is to maximize shareholder wealth

$\to$ We do not mean that anything goes
* *Explain*.
    * The law deters managers from making blatantly dishonest decisions
        
        $\to$ However, most managers are not simply concerned with observing the letter of the law or with keeping to written contracts
    * There are unwritten rules making routine financial transactions feasible, i.e.
        * Each party to the transaction has to trust the other to keep to his or her side of the bargain
        * An individual’s lack of trust is a significant impediment to participation in the stock market
            * *"Lack of trust"*. A subjective fear of being cheated

**Misplaced trust**. Trust is sometimes misplaced
* *Explain*. Charlatans and swindlers are often able to hide behind booming markets
* *Source of unethical business behavior*.
    * Sometimes it is simply because an employee is dishonest
    * Frequently the behavior stems from a culture in the firm, which encourages high-pressure selling or unscrupulous dealing
        
        $\to$ The problem lies with top management, which promotes such values

### Ethical disputes in finance
**Short selling**.
* *Short selling*. Investors who take short positions are betting that securities will fall in price
    * *Procedure*. Borrow the security, selling it for cash, and then waiting in the hope that they will be able to buy it back cheaply
* *Short sellers under unethical view*. 
    * *Brief*. Short selling is unethical since
        * The seller was not only profiting from the misery resulting from the crash in mortgage-backed securities
        * The short trades accentuated the collapse
    * *Usual short sale*. 
        * Short sellers sell all the shares they may have previously owned
        * Short sellers also borrow more shares and sell them too
            
            $\to$ They hope to buy them back for less when the stock price falls
    * *Target companies of short sellers*. Poorly performing companies are natural targets for shortsellers
        * *Consequences*. The companies’ incumbent managers naturally complain, often bitterly
            
            $\to$ Governments sometimes listen to such complaints
* *Short sellers from defensive view*. Selling securities overpriced is no less legitimate than buying those underpriced
    * *Object of a well-functioning market*. Set the correct stock prices, not always higher prices

**Corporate raiders**.
* *Examples*.
    * Edward Lewis in Pretty Woman buys companies, takes them apart, and sells the bits for more than he paid for the total package
    * Gordon Gekko in Wall Street buys a failing company in order to break it up and sell the bits
* *Corporate raiders*. Target companies whose assets can be profitably split up and redeployed
    * *Complain about corporate raiders*. Raiders seek to carve up established companies, often leaving them with heavy debt burdens
        
        $\to$ This is basically in order to get rich quick
    * *Support for corporate raiders*. Sometimes raids can enhance shareholder value
        * *Example*. Timken Co. is forced to split into two separate companies, one for its steel business and one for its industrial bearings business
            * *Motivation*. It is believed that Timken’s combination of unrelated businesses was unfocused and inefficient
            * *Consequence*. 
                * Timken’s stock price rose at the prospect of a breakup
                * A nonbinding shareholder vote on Relational’s proposal attracted a 53% majority
* *Other side effects of corporation raiders*. 
    * Breaking up a portfolio of businesses can create difficult adjustments and job losses
    * Some stakeholders, such as the company’s employees, may lose, however
        
        $\to$ Shareholders and the overall economy can gain if businesses are managed more efficiently

**Tax avoidance**. Multinational companies can reduce their tax bills using legal techniques with exotic, e.g. Dutch Sandwich, Double Irish, and Check-the-Box
* *Problem with tax avoidance techniques*. The public outcry over these revelations suggested that many believed that their use, though legal, was unethical
* *Resulting questions*. 
    * How do companies decide which tax schemes are ethical and which are not?
    * Can a company act in its shareholders’ interest if it voluntarily pays more taxes than it is legally obligated to pay?

## Agency problems and corporate governance
**Drawback of separation of ownership and control**.
* Managers may be tempted to spend cash on unreasonable purposes
* Managers may shy away from attractive but risky projects
    * *Explain*. They are worried more about the safety of their jobs than about maximizing shareholder value
* Managers may work just to maximize their own bonuses, and redouble their efforts to make and resell flawed subprime mortgages

**Agency problem**. Created by conflicts between shareholders’ and managers’ objectives
* *Agents and principals*. When agents work for principals
    * The shareholders are the principals
    * The managers are their agents
* *Agency costs*. The costs associated with the relationship between a "principal", and an "agent", which is incurred when
    * Managers do not attempt to maximize firm value
    * Shareholders incur costs to monitor the managers and constrain their actions

**Consequences of agency problems**. 
* *Extreme example*. Agency problems can sometimes lead to outrageous behavior
    * *Example*. Dennis Kozlowski, the CEO of Tyco, threw a $2 million 40th birthday bash for his wife
        
        $\to$ He charged half of the cost to the company
* *Subtle and moderate agency problems*. Arise whenever managers think just a little less hard about spending money when it is not their own

**Avoidance of agency problem**. We want to ensure that shareholders’ pockets are close to the managers’ hearts
* *Example*. 
    * Have well-designed incentives for managers
    * Have a well-designed standards for accounting and disclosure to investors
    * Requirements for boards of directors
    * Legal sanctions for self-dealing by management

**Risk in government bond**. Government bonds are usually viewed as low-risk investments
* *Explain*. the likelihood of a government defaulting on its loan payment tends to be low
    
    >**NOTE**. Defaults can still happen
