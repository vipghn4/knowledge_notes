# Corporate investment and financing decisions
**Assets**. To carry on business, a corporation needs an almost endless variety of real assets

$\to$ They need to be paid for
* *Paying for assets*. The corporation pays for the real assets by selling claims on them, and on the cash flow generated by them
    * *Financial assets (securities)*. The claims on the assets
    * *Example*. When we want to buy a car, we exchange claims on the car, i.e. partial ownership of the car, for money to buy the car

        $\to$ If the car generates some cash flow, e.g. we use it to earn money, we can also sell claims on the cash flow as well
* *Examples*. 
    * *Bank loan*. The bank provides the corporation with cash in exchange for a financial asset
        
        $\to$ The asset is the corporation’s promise to repay the loan with interest
        * *Bank loan and security*. An ordinary bank loan is not a security
            * *Explain*. It is held by the bank and not sold or traded in financial markets
    * *Corporate bond*. The corporation sells the bond to investors in exchange for the promise to pay interest on the bond and to pay off the bond at its maturity
        
        $\to$ The bond is a financial asset, and also a security
        * *Explain*. It can be held and traded by many investors in financial markets
* *Securities*. Include bonds, shares of stock, and a dizzying variety of specialized instrument

**Investment and financing decision**. We sell financial assets, i.e. make financing decision, to purchase real assets, i.e. make investment decision 
* *Investment decision*. Purchase of real assets
    * *Related problems*.
        * Manage assets already in place
        * Decide when to shut down and dispose of assets if profits decline
        * Manage and control the risks of the investments
* *Financing decision*. Sale of financial assets
    * *Related problems*.
        * Meet obligations to banks, bondholders, and stockholders contributing financing in the past
            * *Example*. The corporation has to repay its debts when they become due
                
                $\to$ Otherwise, it ends up insolvent and bankrupt
        * Pay out cash to the shareholders
* *Examples*.

## Investment decisions
**Capital budgeting (capital expenditure or CAPEX) decisions**. Most large corporations prepare an annual capital budget listing the major projects approved for investment
* *Capital budgeting decision*. Typically a go or no-go decision on a product, service, facility, or activity of the firm
    * *Explain*. We either accept the business proposal or we reject it

        $\to$ This requires sound estimates of the timing and amount of cash flow for the proposal
* *CAPEX decision*. The process of making decisions regarding investments in fixed assets, which are not meant for sale
    * *Examples*. Invest in land, building, plant, machinery, etc.

**Investment**. Today’s capital investments generate future cash returns
* *Cash inflow timing*. The longer we have to wait for cash to flow back in, after an investment
    
    $\to$ The greater the cash inflow required to justify the investment
    * *Consequence*. We need to pay attention to the timing of cash inflows, not only to their cumulative amount
* *Guarantee of cash returns*. Cash returns are not guaranteed
    * *Explain*. An investment could be a smashing success or a dismal failure

**Common pitfalls**. 
* Financial managers do not make major investment decisions in solitary confinement
    
    $\to$ They work as part of a team of engineers and managers from other business functions
* Financial managers are not making billion-dollar investments on a daily basis
    * *Explain*. Most investment decisions are smaller and simpler

        $\to$ Corporations make tons of these smaller investment decisions every year
        * *Examples*. The purchase of a truck, machine tool, or computer system
        * *Consequence*. The cumulative amount of small investments can be as large as that of the occasional big investments

## Financing decisions
**Lenders and shareholders**. A corporation can raise money from lenders or from shareholders
* *Lender*. If the corporation borrows, the lenders contribute the cash
    
    $\to$ The corporation promises to pay back the debt, plus a fixed rate of interest
* *Shareholder*. If the shareholders put up the cash, they do not get a fixed return
    
    $\to$ They hold shares of stock, hence get a fraction of future profits and cash flow
    * *Equity investors*. The shareholders are equity investors, who contribute equity financing
* *Capital structure decision*. The choice between debt and equity financing
    * *Capital*. Refer to the firm’s sources of long-term financing

### Types of financing decision
**Concerns about financing decisions**.
* *Financing choice*. The financing choices available to large corporations seem almost endless
* *Borrowing choice**. We need to consider the following issues
    * Borrowing method, i.e. borrowing from a bank or issuing bonds
    * Borrowing duration
    * Early payment, i.e. reserve the right to pay off the debt early if interest rates fall
    * Payment method, e.g. USD, Euro, etc.

**Methods to raise equity financing**.
* *Option 1*. Issue new shares of stock
    * *Explain*. The investors, who buy the new shares, put up cash
        
        $\to$ They then get a fraction of the corporation’s future cash flow and profits
* *Option 2*. Take the cash flow generated by the existing assets and reinvest the cash in new assets
    
    $\to$ The corporation is reinvesting on behalf of existing stockholders
    * *Consequence*. No new shares are issued

**Distribution of unused cash flow**. When a corporation does not reinvest all of the cash flow generated by its existing assets
* *Option 1*. The corporation hold the cash in reserve for future investment
* *Option 2*. The corporation pay the cash back to its shareholders

**Payout decision**. The decision to pay dividends or repurchase shares

### Financing decision and investment decisions
**Financing decisions versus investment decisions**. Financing decisions are less important than investment decisions
* *Explain*. Value comes mainly from the asset side of the balance sheet
    
    $\to$ The most successful corporations sometimes have the simplest financing strategies
* *Microsoft example*.
    * *Microsoft overall market value (market capitalization) in 2014*.
        * Microsoft shares traded for $47.50 each
        * There were about 8.2 billion shares outstanding
    * *Origins of large market cap*. The market cap came from
        * Microsoft’s product development
        * Its brand name and worldwide customer base
        * Its research and development
        * Its ability to make profitable future investments
    * *Conclusion*. The value did not come from sophisticated financing
        * *Explain*. Microsoft’s financing strategy is very simple
            * It carries no debt to speak of
            * It finances almost all investment by retaining and reinvesting cash flow
* *Conclusion*. Financing decisions may not add much value, compared with good investment decisions

**Importance of finance decisions**. Financing decisions can destroy value if they are stupid, or if they are ambushed by bad news
* *Consequence*. Business is inherently risky
    
    $\to$ We need to identify the risks and make sure they are managed properly
* *Examples*. 
    * Debt has its advantages, but too much debt can land the company in bankruptcy
    * Companies can be knocked off course by recessions, by changes in commodity prices, interest rates and exchange rates, or by adverse political developments

>**NOTE**. Some of the risks can be hedged or insured

## What is a corporation
**Corporations**. A legal entity
* *Corporation in the view of the law*. A legal person, which is owned
by the corporation's shareholders
    * *Operations of corporation as a legal person*.
        * Make contracts
        * Carry on a business
        * Borrow or lend money
        * Sue or be sued
* *Corporation merge*. One corporation can make a takeover bid for
another and then merge the two businesses
* *Paying tax and voting rights*. Corporations pay taxes but cannot vote

**Corporation formation in the U.S.**. Corporations are formed under state law, based on articles of incorporation
* *Articles of incorporation*. Set out the purpose of the business and how it is to be governed and operated
    * *Examples*. Specify the composition and role of the board of directors
* *Corporation’s directors*. Elected by the shareholders
    * *Responsibility*. 
        * Choose and advise top management
        * Sign off on important corporate actions, e.g. mergers and the payment of dividends to shareholders

**Corporation and shareholders**. A corporation is owned by its shareholders but is legally distinct from them
* *Liability of shareholders*. The shareholders have limited liability
    
    $\to$ They cannot be held personally responsible for the corporation’s debts
    * *Consequence*. Shareholders can lose their entire investment in a corporation, but no more
* *Shares distribution*. 
    * *Private shares*. When a corporation is first established
        
        $\to$ Its shares may be privately held by a small group of investors, e.g. the company’s managers and a few backers
        * *Consequence*. The shares are not publicly traded and the company is closely held
    * *Public shares*. When the firm grows and new shares are issued to raise additional capital
        
        $\to$ Its shares are traded in public markets, e.g. NYSE
        * *Public companies*. Companies with publicly traded shares
* *Ownership and control*. A large public corporation may have hundreds of thousands of shareholders owning the business without direct control over it
    
    $\to$ This separation of ownership and control gives corporations permanence
    * *Benefits*. Corporations can, in principle, live forever, and in practice they may survive many human lifetimes
        * Even if managers quit or are dismissed and replaced, the corporation survives
        * Stockholders can sell all their shares to new investors without disrupting the operations of the business
    * *Drawbacks*.
        * Managers and directors can act in their own interests, rather than in the stockholders’ interest
        * The cost, in both time and money, of managing the corporation’s legal machinery
            * *Explain*. These costs are particularly burdensome for small businesses
        * Because the corporation is a separate legal entity
            
            $\to$ It is taxed separately, i.e.
            * Corporations pay tax on their profits
            * Shareholders are taxed again when they receive dividends from the company or sell their shares at a profit

## Other forms of business organization
**Corporations**.
* *Smaller corporations*. Corporations do not have to be prominent, multinational businesses

    $\to$ We can organize a local business as a corporation if desired
* *Common corporation size*. Most corporations are larger businesses or businesses aspiring to grow

**Sole proprietorships**. Small businesses are usually organized as sole proprietorships

**Partnerships**. If businesses growing too large for sole proprietorships do not want to reorganize as corporations

$\to$ They can form a partnership and enter into a partnership agreement
* *Partnership agreement*. Set out 
    * How decisions are to be made
    * How profits are to be split
* *Partners' liability*. Face unlimited liability, just as sole proprietors
    * *Explain*. If the business runs into difficulties
        
        $\to$ Each partner can be held responsible for all the business’s debts
* *Paying tax*. Partnerships have a tax advantage
    * *Explain*. Partnerships, unlike corporations, do not have to pay income taxes
        
        $\to$ The partners simply pay personal income taxes on their shares of the profits
* *Variattions*.
    * *Limited partnership*. A combination of the tax advantage of a partnership with the limited liability advantage of a corporation
        * *Idea*. Partners are classified as general or limited
            * *General partners*. Manage the business and have unlimited personal liability for its debts
            * *Limited partners*. Liable only for the money they invest and do not participate in management
    * *LLPs and LLCs*. Many states allow limited liability partnerships (LLPs) or, equivalently, limited liability companies (LLCs)
        * *Idea*. These are partnerships, in which all partners have limited liability
    * *Professional corporation (PC)*. Commonly used by doctors, lawyers, and accountants
        * *Idea*. The business has limited liability, but the professionals can still be sued personally, e.g. for malpractice
* *Evolution from partnerships to corporations*. The partnership form of organization does not work well when 
    * Ownership is widespread, and
    * Separation of ownership and management is essential

## The role of the financial manager
