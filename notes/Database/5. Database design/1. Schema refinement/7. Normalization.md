# Normalization
**Brief**. This chapter considers algorithms for converting relations to BCNF or 3NF
* *Lossless decomposition*. If a relation schema is not in BCNF

    $\to$ It is possible to obtain a lossless-join decomposition into a collection of BCNF relation schemas
* *Dependency-preserving decomposition*. 
    * *BCNF schemas*. There may not be any dependency-preserving decomposition into a collection of BCNF relation schemas
    * *3NF schemas*. There is always a dependency-preserving, lossless-join decomposition into a collection of 3NF relation schemas

## Decomposition into BCNF
**Lossless decomposition of a relation schema into a collection of BCNF relation schemas**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $R$ is a relation schema, which is not in BCNF
    * $X \subset R$ is a set of attributes
    * $A$ is an attribute in $R$
    * $X\to A$ be an FD causing a violation of BCNF
    * $R − A$ denotes the set of attributes other than $A$ in $R$
    * $XA$ denotes the union of attributes in $X$ and $A$
* *Decomposition method*. 
    1. Decompose $R$ into $R − A$ and $XA$
    2. If either $R − A$ or $XA$ is not in BCNF
    
        $\to$ Decompose them further by a recursive application of the algorithm

**Proof of correctness**.
* *FDs violating BCNF*. An FD $X\to A$ violates BCNF if $A\notin X$, and $X$ is not a superkey

    $\to$ We can always decompose $R$ into smaller relation schemas $R-A$ and $XA$
* *Proof of losslessness*. Since $(R-A)\cap XA=X$ and $X\to A\in F$

    $\to$ The decomposition of $R$ into $R-A$ and $XA$ is lossless
* *Proof of BCNF*. 
    * Decomposing $R$ into $R-A$ and $XA$ will
        * Eliminate the FD $X\to A$, as well as all FDs relating exclusive attributes from both relation schemas
        * Result in two strictly smaller relation schemas $R-A$ and $XA$
    * Hence, by infinitely repeat the algorithm, we will finally come up with
        * Single-attribute relation schemas, which is obviously in BCNF, or
        * Relation schemas, which is in BCNF

**Visualization**. The steps in this decomposition process can be visualized as a tree

$\to$ The root is the original relation, and the leaves are the resulting BCNF relations that
* *Interpretation*. Each internal node is replaced by its children through a single decomposition step, which is guided by the FD shown just below the node

### Redundancy in BCNF revisited
**Brief**. Redundancy can still occur across relations, even though there is no redundancy within a relation

### Alternatives in decomposing to BCNF
**Brief**. If several dependencies violate BCNF, depending on which of these dependencies we choose to guide the next decomposition step

$\to$ We may arrive at quite different collections of BCNF relations
* *Conclusion*. The theory of dependencies can tell us when there is redundancy and give us clues about possible decompositions to address the problem
    
    $\to$ However, it cannot discriminate between decomposition alternatives
    * *Consequence*. A designer has to consider the alternatives and choose one based on the semantics of the application

### BCNF and dependency-preservation
**Existence of dependency-preserving decomposition**. Sometimes, there is no dependency-preserving decomposition into BCNF
* *Example*. Consider the relation schema `SBD`, i.e. sailor `S` has reserved boat `B` on date `D`
    * *Assumptions*. The following FDs hold
        * $SB \to D$, i.e. a sailor can reserve a given boat for at most one day
        * $D \to B$, i.e. on any given day at most one boat can be reserved
    * *Conclusion*. 
        * `SBD` is not in BCNF since `D` is not a key
        * If we try to decompose it, we cannot preserve the dependency $SB \to D$

## Decomposition into 3NF
**BCNF normalization for 3NF**. The approach outlined for lossless-join decomposition into BCNF will also give us a lossless-join decomposition into 3NF

>**NOTE**. Typically, we can stop a little earlier if we are satisfied with a collection of 3NF relations

* *Drawback*. The approach does not ensure dependency-preservation

**Introduction to 3NF normalization**. A simple modification yields a decomposition into 3NF relations, which is lossless-join and dependency-preserving

### Minimal cover for a set of FDs
**Minimal cover for a set $F$ of FDs**. 
* *Definition*. A set $G$ of FDs satisfying
    * Every dependency in $G$ is of the form $X \to A$, where $A$ is a single attribute.
    * The closure $F^+$ is equal to the closure $G^+$
    * If we obtain a set $H$ of dependencies from $G$ by deleting one or more dependencies, or by deleting attributes from a dependency in $G$
        
        $\to$ $F^+ \neq H^+$
* *Interpretation*. A minimal cover for a set $F$ of FDs is an equivalent set of dependencies that is minimal in two respects
    * Every dependency is as small as possible, i.e. 
        * Each attribute on the left side is necessary, and
        * The right side is a single attribute
    * Every dependency in it is required for the closure to be equal to $F^+$

**General algorithm for obtaining a minimal cover of a set $F$ of FDs**.
* *Procedure*.
    1. Put the FDs in a standard form
        * *Explain*. Obtain a collection $G$ of equivalent FDs with a single attribute on the right side, i.e. using the decomposition axiom
    2. Minimize the left side of each FD
        * *Explain*. For each FD in $G$, check each attribute in the left side to see if it can be deleted while preserving equivalence to $F^+$
    3. Delete redundant FDs
        * *Explain*. Check each remaining FD in $G$ to see if it can be deleted while preserving equivalence to $F^+$
* *Alternatives in finding a minimal cover*. The order in which we consider FDs while applying these steps could produce different minimal covers
    
    $\to$ There could be several minimal covers for a given set of FDs
* *Minimizing FDs' left sides prior to redundant FDs checking*. It is necessary to minimize the left sides of FDs before checking for redundant FDs
    * *Explain*. Otherwise, the final set of FDs could still contain some redundant FDs, i.e., not be a minimal cover

### Dependency-preserving decomposition into 3NF
**Dependency-preserving decomposition into 3NF**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $R$ is a relation with a set $F$ of FDs, which is a minimal cover
    * $R_1,R_2,\dots,R_n$ is a lossless-join decomposition of $R$
    * For $1 \leq i \leq n$, each $R_i$ is in 3NF and $F_i$ is the projection of $F$ onto the attributes of $R_i$
* *Decomposition method*.
    1. Identify the set $N$ of dependencies in $F$, which are not preserved, i.e. not included in $(\bigcup_{i=1}^n F_i)^+$
    2. For each FD $X\to A$ in $N$, create a relation schema $XA$ and add it to the decomposition of $R$
* *Proof of correctness*.
    * Every dependency in $F$ is preserved if we replace $R$ by the $R_i$s plus the schemas of the form $XA$
    * The $R_i$s are given to be in 3NF
    * Each of the schemas $XA$ is in 3NF
        * *Explain*. Consider any FD $Y\to B$ in $XA$, we have that
            * If $B=A$, then $Y=X$ must hold, since $X\to A$ is minimal

                $\to$ This does not violate 3NF
            * If $B\neq A$, then $B\in X$, i.e. $B$ is a prime attribute

                $\to$ $Y$ can be any set of attributes without violating 3NF

**Optimization for special cases**. If $N$ contains several FDs with the same left side, e.g. $X \to A_1,X \to A_2, \dots, X \to A_n$

$\to$ We can replace them with a single equivalent FD

$$X t\o A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n$$

* *Consequence*. We produce one relation schema $XA_1\dots A_n$, instead of
several schemas $XA_1,\dots,XA_n$, which is generally preferable

### 3NF synthesis
**Synthesis**. An alternative approach for normalization
* *Idea*. 
    1. Take all the attributes over the original relation $R$ and a minimal cover $F$ for the FDs holding over it
    2. Add a relation schema $XA$ to the decomposition of $R$ for each FD $X \to A$ in $F$
        
        $\to$ The resulting collection of relation schemas is in 3NF and preserves all FDs
    3. If it is not a lossless-join decomposition of $R$
        
        $\to$ Add a relation schema containing just attributes appearing in some key
* *Benefits*. 
    * This algorithm gives us a lossless-join, dependency-preserving decomposition into 3NF
    * This algorithm has polynomial complexity

>**NOTE**. The existence of a polynomial algorithm for obtaining a lossless-join, dependency-preserving decomposition into 3NF is surprising
>
>* *Explain*. Testing whether a given schema is in 3NF is NP-complete

**Database design procedure**. Database designers typically
1. Use a conceptual design methodology, e.g. ER design, to arrive at an initial database design
2. Use normalization techniques to revise the design
