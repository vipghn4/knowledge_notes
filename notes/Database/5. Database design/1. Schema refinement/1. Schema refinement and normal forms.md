# Schema refinement and normal forms
**Schema refinement**. 
* *Initial schema design*. Conceptual database design gives us a set of relation schemas and ICs

    $\to$ These can be regarded as a good starting point for the final database design
* *Schema refinement*. The initial design must be refined by
    * Taking the ICs into account more fully than is possible with just the ER model constructs
    * Considering performance criteria and typical workloads

**Important classes of constraints**. The following classes of constraints can reveal redundancies that cannot be detected easily
* Functional dependencies
* Multivalued dependencies
* Join dependencies

## Introduction
### Problems caused by redundancy
**Bad effects of data redundancy**. Storing the same information redundantly can lead to several problems
* *Redundant storage*. Some information is stored repeatedly
* *Update anomalies*. If one copy of such repeated data is updated
    
    $\to$ An inconsistency is created unless all copies are similarly updated
* *Insertion anomalies*. Unless some other information is stored as well
    
    $\to$ It may not be possible to store some information
* *Deletion anomalies*. Without losing some other information
    
    $\to$ It may not be possible to delete some information

**Example**. Consider a relation

```sql
Hourly_Emps(ssn, name, lot, rating, hourly_wages, hours_worked)
```

* *Functional dependency*. For a given `rating` value, there is only one permissible `hourly_wages` value

    $\to$ It leads to possible redundancy in the relation
    * *Explain*. If the same value appears in the `rating` column of two tuples
        
        $\to$ The same value must appear in the `hourly_wages` column
* *Consequences*.
    * *Redundant storage*. Some information is stored multiple times
    * *Update anomaly*. Potential inconsistency
        * *Example*. The `hourly_wages` in the first tuple could be updated without making a similar change in the second tuple
    * *Insertion anomaly*. We cannot insert a tuple for an employee, unless we know the hourly wage for the employeeâ€™s `rating` value
    * *Deletion anomaly*. If we delete all tuples with a given `rating` value
        
        $\to$ We lose the association between that `rating` value and its `hourly_wage` value
* *Solution*. Use `null`
    * *Drawback*. `null` values cannot help eliminate redundant storage or update anomalies
        
        $\to$ It can address insertion and deletion anomalies
    * *Addressing insertion anomaly*. We can insert an employee tuple with `null` values in `hourly_wage` field
        * *Drawback*. `null` values cannot address all insertion anomalies
            * *Example*. We cannot record `hourly_wage` for a `rating`, unless there is an employee with that `rating`
                * *Explain*. We cannot store a `null` value in `ssn` field, which is a primary key field
    * *Addressing deletion anomaly*. If the last tuple with a given rating would be deleted
        
        $\to$ We store a tuple with `null` values in all fields, except `rating` and `hourly_wages`
        * *Drawback*. This will not work since it requires `the` ssn value to be null, and primary key fields cannot be `null`
    * *Conclusion*. `null` do not provide a general solution to the redundancy problems 

**Ideal schema**. Schemas without redundancy

$\to$ At least, we want to be able to identify schemas, which allow redundancy
* *Explain*. If we choose to accept a schema with some of these drawbacks
    
    $\to$ We want to make an informed decision

### Use of decompositions
**Origin of redundancy problem**. When a relational schema forces an association between attributes, which is not natural
* *Addressing redundancy problem*. Functional dependencies can be used to identify such situations
    
    $\to$ It can hence suggest refinements to the schema
* *Essential idea of solution in many problems*. Replace a relation with a collection of smaller relations
    
    $\to$ Each of the smaller relations contains a strict subset of the attributes of the original relation
    * *Decomposition*. The process above is referred as the decomposition of the larger relation into the smaller relations
* *Example*. The redundancy in `Hourly_Emps` can be addressed by decomposing it into two relations

    ```sql
    Hourly_Emps2(ssn, name, lot, rating, hours_worked)
    Wages(rating, hourly_wages)
    ```

    * *Redundant anomaly*. Even if no employee with that rating appears in the current instance
        
        $\to$ We can easily record `hourly_wage` for any `rating` by adding a tuple to `Wages` of `Hourly_Emps`
    * *Update anomaly*. Changing the wage associated with a rating involves updating a single `Wages` tuple
        * *Benefits*.
            * This is more efficient than updating several tuples, as in the original design
            * The potential for inconsistency is eliminated . Notice that the
    * *Insertion and deletion anomalies*. Eliminated

### Problems related to decompositions
**Brief**. Unless we are careful, decomposing a relation schema can create more problems than it solves

**Questions of interest**.
* Do we need to decompose a relation?
* What problems, if any, does a given decomposition cause?

**Needs for decomposition**. 
* *Normal forms*. To answer the question, several normal forms have been proposed for relations
    * *Explain*. If a relation schema is in one of these normal forms
        
        $\to$ We know that certain kinds of problems cannot arise
* *Answering the question*. 
    1. Consider the normal form of a given relation schema to decide whether or not to decompose it further
    2. If we decide to decompose the relation schema further
        
        $\to$ We must choose a particular decomposition
        
**Problems caused by decomposition**. To answer the question, we consider two properties of decompositions
* *Lossless-join property*. Enable us to recover any instance of the decomposed relation from corresponding instances of the smaller relations
* *Dependency preservation property*. Enable us to enforce any constraint on the original relation by enforcing some contraints on each smaller relations
    * *Explain*. We need not perform joins of the smaller relations to check whether a constraint on the original relation is violated

**Drawback of decompositions**. Queries over the original relation may require us to join the decomposed relations
* *Consequences*. If such queries are common, the performance penalty of decomposing the relation may not be acceptable
    
    $\to$ We may choose to live with some of the problems of redundancy

>**NOTE**. The potential problems caused by residual redundancy should be taken into account in the design and they should be avoided

Our goal in this chapter is to explain some powerful concepts and design guidelines
based on the theory of functional dependencies. 

**Good database designer**. Should have a firm grasp of 
* Normal forms
* What problems they do or do not alleviate
* The decomposition techniques
* Potential problems with decompositions
