# Functional dependencies
**Functional dependency (FD)**. A kind of IC generalizing the concept of a key
* *Assumptions*.
    * $R$ is a relation schema
    * $X$ and $Y$ are nonempty sets of attributes in $R$
* *Functional dependency*. An instance $r$ of $R$ satisfies the FD $X \to Y$ if
    
    $$\forall t_1, t_2 \in r, t_1.X = t_2.X\implies t_1.Y = t_2.Y$$

* *Projection of $t_1$ onto the attributes in $X$*. $t_1.X$
* *Interpretation*. $X \to Y$ means if two tuples agree on the values in attributes $X$
    
    $\to$ They must also agree on the values in attributes $Y$

**Indication of FDs**. ICs must be identified and specified based on the semantics of the real-world enterprise being modeled
* *Consequence*. 
    * By looking at an instance of a relation
        
        $\to$ We might be able to tell that a certain FD does not hold
    * We can never deduce that an FD does hold by looking at one or more instances of the relation
        * *Explain*. An FD, like other ICs, is a statement about all possible legal instances of the relation

**Primary key constraint as a special case of FD**. The attributes in the key play the role of $X$, and the set of all attributes in the relation plays the role of $Y$
* *Difference between FD and primary key constraint*. 
    * An FD does not require that $X$ is minimal
    * The minimality condition must be met for $X$ to be a key
* *Superkey*. 
    * If $X \to Y$ holds, where $Y$ is the set of all attributes, and there is some subset $V \subseteq X$ such that $V \to Y$ holds
        
        $\to$ $X$ is a superkey
    * If $V$ is a strict subset of $X$, then $X$ is not a key
