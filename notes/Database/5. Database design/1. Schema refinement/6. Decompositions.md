# Decompositions
**Brief**. A relation in BCNF is free of redundancy, which can be detected using FD information, and a relation schema in 3NF comes close
* *Consequence*. If a relation schema is not in one of these normal forms
    
    $\to$ The FDs causing a violation can give us insight into the potential problems
* *Main technique for addressing redundancy-related problems*. Decomposing a relation schema into relation schemas with fewer attributes

**Decomposition of a relation schema $R$**. Replace the relation schema by two or more relation schemas

$\to$ Each schema contain a subset of the attributes of $R$ and collectively include all attributes in $R$
* *Intuition*. We want to store the information in any given instance of $R$ by storing projections of the instance

## Lossless-join decomposition
**Lossless-join decomposition**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $R$ is a relation schema
    * $F$ is a set of FDs over $R$
* *Lossless-join decomposition*. A decomposition of $R$ into two schemas with attribute sets $X$ and $Y$ is said to be a lossless-join decomposition w.r.t $F$ if for every instance $r$ of $R$ satisfying the dependencies in $F$

    $$\pi_X(r)\bowtie\pi_Y(r)=r$$

    >**NOTE**. This can easily be extended to decompositions of $R$ into more than two relations

* *Caution*. $r \subseteq \pi_X(r) \bowtie \pi_Y(r)$ always holds, while the other direction does not hold

    * *Explain*. If we take projections of a relation and recombine them using natural join
    
        $\to$ We typically obtain some tuples that were not in the original relation
    * *Consequence*. We lose some information after decomposition
* *Requirement for redundancy eliminating decompositions*. All decompositions used to eliminate redundancy must be lossless

**Test for lossless decompositions**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $R$ is a relation
    * $F$ be a set of FDs holding over R
* *Conclusion*. The decomposition of $R$ into relations with attribute sets $R_1$ and $R_2$ is lossless if and only if
    * $F^+$ contains the FD $R_1 \cap R_2 \to R_1$, or
    * $F^+$ contains the FD $R_1 \cap R_2 \to R_2$
* *Interpretation*. The common attributes of $R_1$ and $R_2$ must contain a key for either $R_1$ or $R_2$
* *Neccessarity and sufficiency of the test*. 
    * If a relation is decomposed into two relations
        
        $\to$ This test is a necessary and sufficient condition for the decomposition to be lossless-join
    * If a relation is decomposed into more than two relations
    
        $\to$ An efficient, i.e. time polynomial in $|F|$, algorithm is available to test whether or not the decomposition is lossless
* *General observations*. 
    * If an FD $X \to Y$ holds over a relation $R$ and $X\cap Y = \emptyset$

        $\to$ The decomposition of $R$ into $R âˆ’ Y$ and $XY$ is lossless

**Repeated decompositions**
* *Assumptions*.
    * A relation $R$ is decomposed into $R_1$ and $R_2$ through a lossless-join decomposition
    * $R_1$ is decomposed into $R_{11}$ and $R_{12}$ through another lossless-join decomposition
* *Conclusion*. The decomposition of $R$ into $R_{11}$, $R_{12}$, and $R_2$ is lossless-join
* *Explain*. 
    * By joining $R_{11}$ and $R_{12}$ we can recover $R_1$
    * By joining $R_1$ and $R_2$, we can recover $R$

## Dependency-preserving decomposition
**Projection of a set of FDs on an attribute set**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $R$ is a relation schema, which is decomposed into two schemas with attribute sets $X$ and $Y$
    * $F$ is a set of FDs over $R$
* *Projection of $F$ on $X$*. The set of FDs $F_X$ in the closure $F^+$, which that involve only attributes in $X$
* *Consequence*. A dependency $U \to V$ in $F^+$ is in $F_X$ only if all the attributes in $U$ and $V$ are in $X$

**Dependency-preserving decomposition**. The decomposition of relation schema $R$ with FDs $F$ into schemas with attribute sets $X$ and $Y$ is dependency-preserving if

$$(F_X \cup F_Y )^+ = F^+$$

* *Explain*. If we take the dependencies in $F_X$ and $F_Y$ and compute the closure of their union

    $\to$ We get back all dependencies in the closure of $F$
* *Consequence*. We need to enforce only the dependencies in $F_X$ and $F_Y$
    
    $\to$ All FDs in $F^+$ are then sure to be satisfied
    * To enforce $F_X$, we need to examine only relation $X$, i.e. on inserts to that relation
    * To enforce $F_Y$, we need to examine only relation $Y$
* *Conclusion*. Intuitively, a dependency-preserving decomposition allows us to enforce all FDs by examining a single relation instance on each insertion or modification of a tuple

    >**NOTE**. Deletions cannot cause violation of FDs

**Testing for dependency preservation**. A direct application of the definition gives us a straightforward algorithm for testing whether a decomposition is dependency-preserving
* *Complexity*. This algorithm is exponential in the size of the dependency set

    >**NOTE**. A polynomial algorithm is available
