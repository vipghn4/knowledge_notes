# Other kinds of dependencies
**Brief**. There is a well-developed theory for database design using multivalued dependencies and join dependencies

$\to$ By taking such dependencies into account, we can identify potential redundancy problems undetectable using FDs alone

## Multivalued dependencies
**Motivating example**. Consider a relation `CTB` with attributes course, teacher, and book
* *Relation interpretation*. Teacher `T` can teach course `C`, and book
`B` is a recommended text for the course
* *Assumptions*.
    * There are no FDs, i.e. the key is `CTB`
    * The recommended texts for a course are independent of the instructor
* *Example*.

    | course | teacher | book |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Physics101 | Green | Mechanics |
    | Physics101 | Green | Optics |
    | Physics101 | Brown | Mechanics |
    | Physics101 | Brown | Optics |
    | Math301 | Green | Mechanics |
    | Math301 | Green | Vectors |
    | Math301 | Green | Geometry |

* *Observations*.
    * The relation schema `CTB` is in BCNF
    
        $\to$ We would not consider decomposing it further if we looked only at the FDs that hold over CTB
    * There is redundancy, e.g. 
        * Green can teach Physics101 is recorded once per recommended text for the course
        * Optics is a text for Physics101 is recorded once per potential teacher
    *  The redundancy can be eliminated by decomposing `CTB` into `CT` and `CB`
* *Redundancy in `CTB`*. Due to the constraint that `T` for a `C` are independent of the instructors, which cannot be expressed in terms of FDs

    $\to$ This constraint is an example of a multivalued dependency
* *Ideal solution*. Use two binary relationship sets, i.e. `Instructors` with attributes `CT` and `Text` with attributes `CB`
    * *Explain*. These are two essentially independent relationships
        
        $\to$ Modeling them with a single ternary relationship set with attributes `CTB` is inappropriate
* *Conclusion*. Given the subjectivity of ER design, however, we might create a ternary relationship
    
    $\to$ A careful analysis of the MVD information would then reveal the problem

**Multivalued dependency (MVD)**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $R$ is a relation schema
    * $X$ and $Y$ are subsets of the attributes of $R$
* *Multivalued dependency*. Multivalued dependency $X \twoheadrightarrow Y$ is said to hold over $R$ if, in every legal instance $r$ of $R$
    
    $\to$ Each $X$ value is associated with a set of $Y$ values, which is independent of the values in the other attributes
* *Formal definition*. If the MVD $X \twoheadrightarrow Y$ holds over $R$, then for each pair of tuples $t,u\in R$ agreeing on $X$, i.e. $t.X = u.X$

    $\to$ We can find another tuple $v\in R$ satisfying
    * $v$ agrees with both $t$ and $u$ on $X$, i.e. $v.X=t.X=u.X$
    * $v$ agrees with $t$ on $Y$, i.e. $t.XY=v.XY$
    * $v$ agrees with $u$ on $R-XY$, i.e. attributes not $X$'s or $Y$'s, or

        $$u.(R-XY)=v.(R-XY)$$

* *Interpretation*. Multivalued dependency occurs when two attributes in a table are independent of each other but, both depend on a third attribute

**Orignial definition**.
* *Assumption*.
    * $R(X_1,\dots,X_m,Y_1,\dots,Y_n,Z_1,\dots,Z_r)$ is a relation with $m+n+r$ columns
    * $\mathbf{X}=\{X_1,\dots,X_m\}$, $\mathbf{Y}$ and $\mathbf{Z}$ are defined similarly
    * $\mathbf{x}=(x_1,\dots,x_m)$ are entries appearing under columns $X_1,\dots,X_m$, $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{z}$ are defined similarly
    * $\mathbf{Y}_{\mathbf{x}\mathbf{z}}=\{\mathbf{y}:(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{z}) \in R\}$
* *Multivalued dependency*. $\mathbf{X}\twoheadrightarrow\mathbf{Y}$ holds for $R(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Y},\mathbf{Z})$ if $\mathbf{Y}_{\mathbf{x}\mathbf{z}}$ depends only on $\mathbf{x}$
    * *Explain*. $\mathbf{Y}_{\mathbf{x}\mathbf{z}}=\mathbf{Y}_{\mathbf{x}\mathbf{z}'}$ for each $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z},\mathbf{z}'$ satisfying $\mathbf{Y}_{\mathbf{x}\mathbf{z}},\mathbf{Y}_{\mathbf{x}\mathbf{z}'}$ are nonempty
* *Example*. Consider the relation `T(Employee, Child, Salary, Year)`

    $\to$ `Employee ->-> Child` holds for `T`
* *Reference*. http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/people/fagin/tods77.pdf

**Formal example**. Consider the following instance of some relation $R$

| X | Y | Z |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $a$ | $b_1$ | $c_1$ | tuple $t_1$ |
| $a$ | $b_2$ | $c_2$ | tuple $t_2$ |
| $a$ | $b_1$ | $c_2$ | tuple $t_3$ |
| $a$ | $b_2$ | $c_1$ | tuple $t_4$ |

* *Observations*. If we are given the first two tuples and told that the MVD $X \twoheadrightarrow Y$ holds over this relation
    
    $\to$ We can infer that the relation instance must also contain the third tuple
    * *Example*. By interchanging the roles of the first two tuples, treating the first tuple as $t_2$ and the second tuple as $t_1$
        
        $\to$ We can deduce that the tuple $t_4$ must also be in the relation instance

**MVDs in `CTB` example**. The constraint that course texts are independent of instructors can be expressed as $C\twoheadrightarrow T$
* *Interpretation in terms of MVD's definition*.

    ```
    If there is a tuple showing that C is taught by teacher T,
    and there is a tuple showing that C has book B as text,
    then there is a tuple showing that C is taught by T and has text B 
    ```

**Another way to think about MVDs**. If $X \twoheadrightarrow Y$ holds over $R$, then

$$\pi_{YZ}[\sigma_{X=x}(R)] = \pi_Y [\sigma_{X=x}(R)] \times \pi_Z[\sigma_{X=x}(R)]$$

in every legal instance of $R$, for any value $x$ that appears in the $X$ column of $R$
* *Interpretation*.
    * Consider groups of tuples in R with the same $X$-value, for each $X$-value
    * In each such group consider the projection onto the attributes $YZ$
        
        $\to$ This projection must be equal to the cross-product of the projections onto $Y$ and $Z$
* *Explain*. For a given $X$-value, the $Y$-values and $Z$-values are independent
* *Consequence*. $X \twoheadrightarrow Y$ must hold whenever $X \to Y$ holds
    * *Explain*. If the FD $X \to Y$ holds, there is exactly one $Y$-value for a given $X$-value
        
        $\to$ The conditions in the MVD definition hold trivially
    
    >**NOTE**. The converse does not hold

**Inference of FDs and MVDs given a set of FDs and MVDs**. Given a set of FDs and MVDs

$\to$ In general we can infer that several additional FDs and MVDs hold
* *Inference rules*. A sound and complete set of inference rules consists of the three Armstrong Axioms plus five additional rules
* *Rules involving only MVDs*. Three of the additional rules involve only MVDs
    * *MVD complementation*. If $X \twoheadrightarrow Y$, then $X \twoheadrightarrow R − XY$
    * *MVD augmentation*. If $X \twoheadrightarrow Y$ and $W \supseteq Z$, then $WX \twoheadrightarrow YZ$
        * *Explain*.
            * $W\supseteq Z$ implies $W\to Z$, which further implies $W\twoheadrightarrow Z$
            * Hence, $YZ$ collectively depends on $WX$ while being independent of other attributes
    * *MVD transitivity*. If $X \twoheadrightarrow Y$ and $Y \twoheadrightarrow Z$, then $X \twoheadrightarrow (Z − Y)$
        * *Explain*. Since $Z-Y\subseteq Z$, which satisfies $X\twoheadrightarrow Z$
* *Rules involving FDs and MVDs*. The remaining two additional rules relate FDs and MVDs
    * *Replication*. If $X \to Y$, then $X \twoheadrightarrow Y$

        $\to$ Every FD is also an MVD
    * *Coalescence*. If $X \twoheadrightarrow Y$ and there is a $W$ such that 
        
        $$W \cap Y = \emptyset,\quad W \to Z,\quad Y \supseteq Z$$
        
        then $X \to Z$

**Proof of coalescence rule**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $R$ is the relation of interest
    * $x,y,z$ four tuples of $R$ with the same value of $X$, i.e.

        $$x.X=y.X=z.X=t.X$$

    * $x.Y\neq y.Y$, i.e. for simplicity, we consequentially assume that

        $$z.Y=x.Y,\quad z.(R-XY)=y.(R-XY)$$

    * For simplicity, we assume that $W\cap X=\emptyset$
* *Observations*.
    * Since $W\cap Y=\emptyset$, we have that $z.W=y.W$

        $\to$ $z.Z=y.Z$ must hold, since $W\to Z$
    * Since $z.Y=x.Y$ and $Y\supseteq Z$, we have that $x.Z=z.Z$
    
        $\to$ Consequentially, we have that $x.Z=y.Z=z.Z$
    * The observations hold for any values of $X,Y$
* *Conclusion*. $X\to Z$ must hold

## Fourth normal form
**Fourth normal form**. A direct generalization of BCNF
* *Assumptions*.
    * $R$ is a relation schema
    * $X$ and $Y$ are nonempty subsets of the attributes of $R$
    * $F$ is a set of dependencies, including both FDs and MVDs
* *Fourth normal form*. $R$ is said to be in fourth normal form, i.e. 4NF, if for every MVD $X \twoheadrightarrow Y$ holding over $R$, one of the following statements is true
    * $Y \subseteq X$ or $XY = R$, or
    * $X$ is a superkey
* *Interpretation*. $X \twoheadrightarrow Y$ is a trivial MVD if $Y \subseteq X \subseteq R$ or $XY = R$
    
    $\to$ For every one of its non-trivial multivalued dependencies $X \twoheadrightarrow Y$, $X$ is a superkey
* *Definition of key in 4NF*. The definition of a key has not changed
    
    $\to$ The key must uniquely determine all attributes through FDs alone

**Normalizing a relation schema to 4NF**. Consider the relation `CTB` in the previous section

$\to$ This is not in 4NF since `C ->-> T` is a nontrivial MVD and `C` is not a key
* *Redundancy elimination*. Decompose `CTB` into `CT` and `CB`
    
    $\to$ Each of these relations is then in 4NF

**Date and Fagin's conditions for safely ignoring MVD information**. These conditions can be detected using only FD information
* *Idea*. Under these conditions, using MVD information in addition to the FD information will not reveal any redundancy
    
    $\to$ If these conditions hold, we do not even need to identify all MVDs
* *Date and Fagin's conditions*. If a relation schema is in BCNF, and at least one of its keys consists of a single attribute
    
    $\to$ It is also in 4NF
    * *Implicit assumption*. The set of FDs identified is indeed the set of all FDs holding over the relation
        
        >**NOTE**. This assumption is important because the result relies on the relation being in BCNF
        >
        >$\to$ The result depends on the set of FDs holding over the relation

* *Proof*. Consider any MVD $X\twoheadrightarrow Y$ in a relation $R$ satisfying the Date and Fagin's condition
    * *Case 1*. If $X$ is a superkey, then $X\twoheadrightarrow Y$ does not violate 4NF
    * *Case 2*. If $X$ is not a superkey and $Y\subseteq X$, then $X\twoheadrightarrow Y$ does not violate 4NF
    * *Case 3*. If $X$ is not a superkey and $Y\not\subseteq X$, then we need to prove that $XY=R$
        * If $XY\neq R$, then there must exists a $W=R-XY\neq\emptyset$
            
            $\to$ Consider tuples $x,y,z$ of $R$, with $x.X=y.X=z.X$
        * We have that

            $$x.Y=z.Y,\quad y.W=z.W$$

            hence $x.W=z.W=y.W$, which further implies that $X\to W$
            * *Explain*. By the Date and Fagin's condition, we have that $Y$ is a superkey
        * By the definition of BCNF and the assumption that $X$ is not a superkey, $X\to W$ only happens when $W\subseteq X$

            $\to$ $XY=R$ must hold, indicating that $X\twoheadrightarrow Y$ does not violate 4NF
* *Conclusion*. The Date-Fagin result offers a convenient way to check if a relation is in 4NF, without reasoning about MVDs

## Join dependencies
**Join dependency (JD)**. A further generalization of MVDs
* *Definition*. If $R_1,\dots,R_n$ is a lossless-join decomposition of $R$
    
    $\to$ A JD $\bowtie \{R_1,\dots,R_n\}$ is said to hold over a relation $R$

**MVD as a specificataion of JD**. An MVD $X \twoheadrightarrow Y$ over a relation $R$ can be expressed as the join dependency $\bowtie \{XY, X(R-Y)\}$
* *Example*. Consider the `CTB` relation, the MVD `C ->-> T` can be expressed as the join dependency $\bowtie\{\text{CT},\text{CB}\}$
* *Interpretation*. $Y$ depends on $X$ without depending on $R-XY$
* *Proof*. We need to prove that any MVD is a JD, i.e. $X\twoheadrightarrow Y$ implies $\bowtie\{XY,X(R-Y)\}$

    $\to$ This is easily proven using the definition of MVD

>**NOTE**. Unlike FDs and MVDs, there is no set of sound and complete inference rules for JDs

## Fifth normal form
**Fifth normal form (5NF)**. 
* *Definition*. A relation schema $R$ is in 5NF if for every JD $\bowtie\{R_1,\dots,R_n\}$ holding over R
    
    $\to$ One of the following statements is true
    * $R_i = R$ for some $i$, or
    * The JD is implied by the set of those FDs over $R$, in which the left side is a key for $R$
* *Declarification of the second condition*. Intuitively, we must be able to show that the decomposition of $R$ into $\{R_1,\dots,R_n\}$ is lossless-join whenever the key dependencies hold
    * *Key dependencies*. FDs in which the left side is a key for $R$
* *Interpretation*. $\bowtie \{R_1,\dots,R_n\}$ is a trivial JD if $R_i = R$ for some $i$

**Date and Fagin's conditions for safely ignoring JD information**. These conditions can be detected using only FD information
* *Date and Fagin's condition*. If a relation schema is in 3NF and each of its keys consists of a single attribute
    
    $\to$ It is also in 5NF

    >**NOTE**. The conditions identified in this result are sufficient for a relation to be in 5NF, but not necessary

* *Conclusion*. The result can be very useful in practice
    * *Explain*. It allows us to conclude that a relation is in 5NF without identifying the MVDs and JDs holding over the relation

## Inclusion dependencies
**Brief**. MVDs and JDs can be used to guide database design, although they are less common than FDs and harder to recognize and reason about

$\to$ In contrast, inclusion dependencies are very intuitive and quite common

>**NOTE**. Inclusion dependencies typically have little influence on database design, beyond the ER design stage

**Inclusion dependency**. Some columns of a relation are contained in other columns, usually of a second relation
* *Examples*. 
    * A foreign key constraint
    * If $R$ and $S$ are two relations obtained by translating two entity sets
        * *Explain*. Every $R$ entity is also an $S$ entity

**Handle inclusion dependencies**. We should not split groups of attributes participating in an inclusion dependency
* *Example*. Consider an inclusion dependency $\text{AB} \subseteq \text{CD}$
    * *Decomposition rule*. While decomposing the relation schema containing `AB`
        
        $\to$ We should ensure that at least one of the schemas obtained in the decomposition contains both `A` and `B`
    * *Explain*. Otherwise, we cannot check the inclusion dependency $\text{AB} \subseteq \text{CD}$ without reconstructing the relation containing `AB`

**Key-based inclusion dependencies**. Most common type of inclusion dependencies in practice
* *Key-based inclusion dependencies*. IDs involving only keys
    * *Example*. Foreign key constraints
* *Handle key-based IDs*. If all inclusion dependencies are key-based
    
    $\to$ We rarely have to worry about splitting attribute groups participating in inclusions
    * *Explain*. Decompositions usually do not split the primary key

>**NOTE**. Going from 3NF to BCNF always involves splitting some key, hopefully not the primary key
>
>* *Explain*. The dependency guiding the split is of the form $X \to A$ where $A$ is part of a key
