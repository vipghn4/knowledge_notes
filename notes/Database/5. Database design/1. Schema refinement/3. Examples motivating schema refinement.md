# Examples motivating schema refinement
**Brief**.
* *Questions of interest*. 
    * Do we need to decompose relations produced by translating an ER diagram?
    * Should not a good ER design lead to a collection of good relations?
* *Answer*. ER design can generate some schemas with redundancy problems
    * *Explain*. 
        * It is a complex, subjective process
        * Certain constraints are not expressible in terms of ER diagrams

## Constraints on an entity set
**Expressive limitation of ER model**. Only FDs determining all attributes of a relation, i.e., key constraints, can be expressed in the ER model
* *Example*. Consider the rating-wage association in `Hourly_Emps` in section 5.1

    $\to$ This association cannot be expressed with an ER model

**Non-key-constraint FD**. We could argue that the problem with the original design of `Hourly_Emps` was an artifact of a poor ER design

$\to$ This could have been avoided via decomposition
* *Problem*. We could easily arrive at the original design given the subjective nature of ER modeling
* *Consequence*. Having formal techniques to identify the design problem, and to guide us to a better design, is very
useful

>**NOTE**. The value of such techniques cannot be underestimated when designing large schemas with more than a hundred tables are not uncommon

## Constraints on a relationship set
**Brief**. The previous example illustrated how FDs can help to refine the subjective decisions during ER design
* *Conclusion*.
    * The best possible ER diagram would have led to the same final set of relations
    * FD information can lead to a set of relations without some redundancy problems, and is unlikely to be arrived at solely through ER design

**Example**. 
* *Scenario*. Consider entity sets `Parts`, `Suppliers`, `Departments`, AND a relationship set `Contracts` between them
    * *Contract schema formulation*. `CQPSD`
        * *Interpretation*.  Contract id `C`* specifies that a supplier `S` will supply some quantity `Q` of a part `P` to a department `D`
    * *Business policy*. A department purchases at most one part from any given supplier
        * *Consequence*. If there are several contracts between the same supplier and department
            
            $\to$ The same part must be involved in all of them
        * *Conclusion*. This constraint is an FD, i.e. $DS \to P$
* *Problem*. We have redundancy and its associated problems
* *Solution*. Decompose `Contracts` into two relations with attributes `CQSD` and `SDP`
    * `SDP` records the part supplied to a department by a supplier
    * `CQSD` records additional information about a contract
* *Conclusion*. It is unlikely that we would arrive at such a design solely through ER modeling
    * *Explain*. It is hard to formulate an entity or relationship corresponding naturally to `CQSD`

## Identifying attributes of entities
**Brief**. This section illustrates how a careful examination of FDs can lead to a better understanding of the entities and relationships underlying the relational tables
* *Explain*. Attributes can easily be associated with the wrong entity set during ER design

**Example**.
* *Scenario*. Consider the relationship set `Works_In` with a key constraint, i.e. an employee can work in at most one department

    <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BfABmS9.png">
        <figcaption>Works_In relationship set</figcaption>
    </div>

    * *Relations translated from the ER diagram*.

        ```sql
        Workers(ssn, name, lot, did, since)
        Departments(did, dname, budget)
        ```

    * *Additional constraint*. The constraint $\text{did}\to\text{lot}$ is not expressible w.r.t the ER diagram, i.e.
        * Employees are assigned parking lots based on their department
        * All employees in a given department are assigned the same lot
* *Solution*. Decompose the `Workers` relation into two relations

    ```sql
    Workers2(ssn, name, did, since)
    Dept_Lots(did, lot)
    ```

* *Revised solution*. A `Departments` tuple and a `Dept_Lots` tuple with the same key value describe the same entity

    $\to$ We can revise the solution as

    ```sql
    Workers2(ssn, name, did, since)
    Departments(did, dname, budget, lot)
    ```

* *Conclusion*. It seems intuitive to associate lots with employees, however, lots are really associated with departments

    $\to$ The subjective process of ER modeling could miss this point

## Identifying entity sets
**Brief**. This section concerns how FD information can help to decide whether a concept should be modeled as an entity or as an attribute

**Example**.
* *Scenario*. Consider a schema `Reserves`
    * *Schema attributes*.
        * `S`, `B`, and `D`, indicating that sailor `S` has a reservation for boat `B` on day `D`
        * Attribute `C` denoting the credit card, to which the reservation is charged
    * *Constraints*.
        * Every sailor uses a unique credit card for reservations, i.e. $S \to C$
* *Subjective solution*. Store the `C` for a sailor, as often as we have reservations for that
sailor in `Reserves`
    
    $\to$ We have redundancy and potential update anomalies
* *Solution*. Decompose `Reserves` into two relations with attributes `SBD` and `SC`
    * *Explain*. 
        * One holds information about reservations
        * The other holds information about credit cards
