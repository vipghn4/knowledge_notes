# Reasoning about functional dependencies
**Brief**. FDs in more detail because they play such a central role in schema analysis and refinement

**FDs implied by FDs**. Given a set of FDs over a relation schema $R$

$\to$ There are typically several additional FDs holding over R whenever all of the given FDs hold
* *Example*. Consider the following schema

    ```sql
    Workers(ssn, name, lot, did, since)
    ```

  * *Observation*. If $\text{ssn} \to \text{did}$ holds, and since $\text{ssn}$ is the key, and FD $\text{did} \to \text{lot}$ is given to hold
      
      $\to$ the FD $\text{ssn} \to \text{lot}$ also holds on `Workers`
* *Terminology*. An FD $f$ is implied by a given set $F$ of FDs if $f$ holds whenever all FDs in $F$ hold

## Closure of a set of FDs
**Close of a set of FDs**. The set $F^+$ of all FDs implied by the given set $F$ of FDs
* *Important question*. How we can infer, or compute, the closure
of a given set F of FDs

**Armstrong’s axioms**. Used to apply repeatedly to infer all FDs implied by a set $F$ of FDs
* *Assumptions*.
    * $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are sets of attributes over a relation schema $R$
* *Armstrong's axioms*.
    * *Reflexivity*. If $X \supseteq Y$, then $X \to Y$
    * *Augmentation*. If $X \to Y$, then $XZ \to YZ$ for any $Z$
    * *Transitivity*. If $X \to Y$ and $Y \to Z$, then $X \to Z$
* *Soundness of Armstrong’s axioms*. The axioms generate only FDs in $F^+$ when applied to a set $F$ of FDs
* *Completeness of Armstrong’s axioms*. Repeated application of the axioms will generate all FDs in the closure $F^+$
* *Additional rules to reason about $F^+$.
    * *Union*. If $X \to Y$ and $X \to Z$, then $X \to YZ$
    * *Decomposition*. If $X \to YZ$, then $X \to Y$ and $X \to Z$

**Trivial FD**. A FD, in which the RHS contains only attribute, which also appear on the LHS, i.e. such dependencies always hold due
to reflexivity

## Attribute closure
**Attribute closure of a set $X$ of attributes w.r.t a set $F$ of FDs**. The set of attributes $A$ such that $X \to A$ can be inferred from $F$ using the Armstrong axioms

**Problem of interest**. Check if a given dependency $X \to Y$ is in the closure of a set $F$ of FDs efficiently without computing $F^+$
* *Solution*. Compute the attribute closure $X^+$ w.r.t $F$

**Computing the attribute closure of a set $X$ of attributes**.

```python
closure = X;
while (there is some change):
    if there is an FD (U => V) in F such that U is a subset of closure:
        closure = closure union V
```

* *Usage*. 
    * This algorithm can be modified to find keys, i.e.
        1. Start with set $X$ containing a single attribute
        2. Stop as soon as closure contains all attributes in the relation schema
    * By varying the starting attribute and the order, in which the algorithm considers FDs
        
        $\to$ We can obtain all candidate keys
