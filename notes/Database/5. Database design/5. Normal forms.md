# Normal forms
**Brief**. Given a relation schema, we need to decide whether it is a good design or whether we need to decompose it into smaller relations

$\to$ Such a decision must be guided by an understanding of what problems, if any, arise from the current schema

**Normal forms**.
* *Normal forms*. Proposed to provide the guidance above
    * *Explain*. If a relation schema is in one of these normal forms
        
        $\to$ We know that certain kinds of problems cannot arise
* *Normal forms based on FDs*.
    * First normal form (1NF)
    * Second normal form (2NF)
    * Third normal form (3NF)
    * Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)
* *Increasing restrictive requirements of normal forms*.
    * Every relation in BCNF is also in 3NF
    * Every relation in 3NF is also in 2NF
    * Every relation in 2NF is in 1NF
* *Brief introduction about normal forms*.
    * A relation is in first normal form if every field contains only atomic values, i.e. not lists or sets
    * 2NF is mainly of historical interest
    * 3NF and BCNF are important from a database design standpoint

**FDs' role**. If more detailed ICs are specified, we may be able to detect more subtle redundancies as well

## Boyce-Codd normal form
**Boyce-Codd normal form**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $R$ is a relation schema
    * $X$ is a subset of the attributes of $R$
    * $A$ is an attribute of $R$
* *Conclusion*. R is in Boyce-Codd normal form if for every FD $X \to A$ holding over $R$, one of the following statements is true
    * $A \in X$, i.e. it is a trivial FD, or
    * $X$ is a superkey
* *Interpretation*. The only nontrivial dependencies are those in which a key determines some attribute(s)

    $\to$ Each tuple can be seen as an entity or relationship, identified by a key and described by the remaining attributes
    * *Kent's quote*. Each attribute must describe the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key

**Checking if a relation is in BCNF**. Consider a set $F$ of FDs, to check if $R$ is in Boyce-Codd normal form

$\to$ It suffices to check whether the left side of each dependency in $F$ is a superkey
* *Explain*. Due to the interpretation of BCNF

**BCNF and redundancy detection**. BCNF ensures that no redundancy can be detected using FD information alone

$\to$ BCNF is the most desirable normal form, from the point of view of redundancy, if we take into account only FD information
* *Explain*. Since we take into account only FD information, and no redundancy can be detected given them

    $\to$ The relation turns out to have the least redundancy conditionally on the FD information
* *Data in a BCNF relation*. If a relation is in BCNF
    
    $\to$ Every field of every tuple records a piece of information that cannot be inferred, using only FDs, from the values in all other fields in all tuples of the relation instance

## Third normal form
**Third normal form**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $R$ is a relation schema
    * $X$ is a subset of the attributes of $R$
    * $A$ is an attribute of $R$
* *Conclusion*. $R$ is in third normal form if for every FD $X \to A$ holding over R, one of the following statements is true
    * $A \in X$, i.e. it is a trivial FD, or
    * $X$ is a superkey, or
    * $A$ is part of some key for $R$
* *3NF versus BCNF*. 
    * 3NF is similar to BCNF, with the only difference being the third condition, i.e.
        
        $\to$ Every BCNF relation is also in 3NF
    * In BCNF, every partial key, i.e. prime attribute, can only depend on a superkey

        $\to$ In 3NF, a partial key can also depend on an attribute, which is not a superkey
* *Interpretation of the last condition*. 
    * *Interpretaion 1*. Recall that a key for a relation is a minimal set of attributes uniquely determining all other attributes
        
        >**NOTE**. $A$ must be part of a key, i.e. any key, if there are several
        >
        >$\to$ It is not enough for $A$ to be part of a superkey
    
    * *Interpretation 2*. All data in a table must depend on that table's primary key, and not on any other field in the table, i.e.
        * Any data field, which belongs to no key, must depend on some key
        * Any data field, which is part of some key, may depend on anything

**Checking if a relation is in 3NF**. Finding all keys of a relation schema is known to be an NP-complete problem, 

$\to$ Determining whether a relation schema is in 3NF is NP-complete as well

**Violation of 3NF**. There are two cases a dependency $X \to A$ can violate 3NF

    <figcaption>Partial dependencies and transitive dependencies</figcaption>
</div>

* *Partial dependency*. $X$ is a proper subset of some key $K$
    
    $\to$ $(X, A)$ pairs are stored redundantly
    * *Example*. Consider the `Reserves` relation with attributes `SBDC`
        * *Assumptions*.
            * The only key is `SBD`
            * There is a FD $S \to C$
        * *Consequence*. `C` for a sailor as many times as there are reservations for that sailor
* *Transitive dependency*. $X$ is not a proper subset of any key

    $\to$ There is a chain of dependencies $K \to X \to A$
    * *Consequence*. We cannot associate an $X$ value with a $K$ value, unless we also associate an $A$ value with an $X$ value
* *Reference*. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48012245/are-all-relational-schemas-with-partial-dependencies-not-in-3nf

**Motivation for 3NF**. The motivation is rather technical
* *Explain*. By making an exception for certain dependencies involving key attributes
    
    $\to$ Every relation schema can be decomposed into a collection of 3NF relations using only decompositions with certain desirable properties
    
    >**NOTE**. Such a guarantee does not exist for BCNF relations

* *Conclusion*. The 3NF definition weakens the BCNF requirements just enough to make the guarantee possible
    
    $\to$ We compromise by settling for a 3NF design

**Redundancy with 3NF**. Unlike BCNF, some redundancy is possible with 3NF
* *Redundancy with 3NF*. If there is a nontrivial dependency $X \to A$ and $X$ is not a superkey
    
    $\to$ The problems associated with partial and transitive dependencies persist
    
    >**NOTE**. The problems persist even if the relation is in 3NF because A is part of a key

* *Example*. Consider the `Reserves` relation with attributes `SBDC` and the FD $S \to C$
    * `S` is not a key, and `C` is not part of a key
        * *Explain*. The only key is `SBD`
        * *Consequence*. The relation is not in 3NF, and `(S, C)` pairs are stored redundantly
    * If we also know that credit cards uniquely identify the owner
        
        $\to$ We have the FD $C \to S$, i.e. `CBD` is also a key for `Reserves`
        * *Consequence*. 
            * The dependency $S \to C$ does not violate 3NF, and `Reserves` is in 3NF
            * In all tuples containing the same `S` value, the same `(S, C)` pair is redundantly recorded

**Second normal form (2NF)**. 3NF with no partial dependency
* *Consequence*. If a relation is in 3NF, i.e. precluding both partial and transitive dependencies
    
    $\to$ It is also in 2NF
