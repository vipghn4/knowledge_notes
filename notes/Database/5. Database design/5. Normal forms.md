# Normal forms
**Brief**. Given a relation schema, we need to decide whether it is a good design or whether we need to decompose it into smaller relations

$\to$ Such a decision must be guided by an understanding of what problems, if any, arise from the current schema

**Normal forms**.
* *Normal forms*. Proposed to provide the guidance above
    * *Explain*. If a relation schema is in one of these normal forms
        
        $\to$ We know that certain kinds of problems cannot arise
* *Normal forms based on FDs*.
    * First normal form (1NF)
    * Second normal form (2NF)
    * Third normal form (3NF)
    * Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)
* *Increasing restrictive requirements of normal forms*.
    * Every relation in BCNF is also in 3NF
    * Every relation in 3NF is also in 2NF
    * Every relation in 2NF is in 1NF
* *Brief introduction about normal forms*.
    * A relation is in first normal form if every field contains only atomic values, i.e. not lists or sets
    * 2NF is mainly of historical interest
    * 3NF and BCNF are important from a database design standpoint

**FDs' role**. If more detailed ICs are specified, we may be able to detect more subtle redundancies as well

## Boyce-Codd normal form
Let R be a relation schema, X be a subset of the attributes of R, and let A be an
attribute of R. R is in Boyce-Codd normal form if for every FD X ! A that holds
over R, one of the following statements is true:
A 2 X; that is, it is a trivial FD, or
X is a superkey

## Third normal form
