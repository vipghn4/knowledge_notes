# Introduction to database systems
**Motivation**. 
* *Observations*.
    * The success of an organization depends on its ability to 
        * Acquire accurate and timely data about its operations
        * Manage this data effectively
        * Use it to analyze and guide its activities
    * The amount of information available to us is literally exploding, and the value of data as an organizational asset is widely recognized
* *Problem*. Without the ability to manage this data, and to quickly find the queried information

    $\to$ It tends to become a distraction and a liability, rather than an asset

**Database**. A collection of data typically describing the activities of one or more related organizations
* *Entity*. For example, students, faculty, courses, and classrooms in a university database
* *Relationships between entities*. For example, students' enrollment in courses, faculty teaching courses, etc.

**Database management system (DBMS)**. A software designed to assist in maintaining and utilizing large collections of data

$\to$ The need for such systems, as well as their use, is growing rapidly
* *Alternative to using a DBMS*. Use ad hoc approaches which do not carry over from one application to another

## Overview
**Objective of this book**. How to design a database and use a DBMS effectively

$\to$ Many decisions about how to use a DBMS for a given application depend on what capabilities the DBMS supports efficiently
* *Consequence*. To use a DBMS well, it is necessary to also understand how a DBMS works

**Questions of interest**.
* *Database Design*. 
    * How can a user describe a real-world enterprise, e.g., a university, in terms of the data stored in a DBMS? 
    * What factors must be considered in deciding how to organize the stored data?
* *Data Analysis*. How can a user answer questions about the enterprise by posing queries over the data in the DBMS?
* *Concurrency and Robustness*. 
    * How does a DBMS allow many users to access data concurrently
    * How does it protect the data in the event of system failures
* *Efficiency and Scalability*. How does a DBMS store large datasets and answer questions against this data efficiently?
* *Advanced topics*. 
    * Parallel and distributed database management
    * Internet databases
    * Data warehousing and complex queries for decision support
    * Data mining
    * Object databases
    * Spatial data management
    * Rule-oriented DBMS extensions

## File systems versus a DBMS
**Scenario**. A company has a large collection of data on employees, departments, products, sales, and so on

$\to$ This data is accessed concurrently by several employees
* *Requirements*. 
    * Questions about the data must be answered quickly
    * Changes made to the data by different users must be applied consistently
    * Access to certain parts of the data, e.g., salaries, must be restricted

**File system approach**. Store the data in a collection of OS files
* *Memory space problem*. We may not have enough space of main memory to hold all the data
    
    $\to$ We must store data in a storage device, e.g. a disk or tape, and bring relevant parts into main memory for processing as needed
* *Indexing problem*. Even if we have enough main memory, on computer systems with 32-bit addressing, we cannot refer directly to more than about 4 GB of data
    
    $\to$ We have to program some method of identifying all data items
* *Data query problem*. We have to write special programs to answer each question that users may want to ask about the data
    
    $\to$ These programs are likely to be complex because of the large volume of data to be searched
* *Data consistency problem*. We must protect the data from inconsistent changes made by concurrent accesses to the data
    
    $\to$ If programs accessing the data are designed to cope with concurrent access, their complexity may increase greatly
* *System failure problem*. Data must be restored to a consistent state if the system crashes while changes are being made
* *Security problem*. Operating systems provide only a password mechanism for security
    
    $\to$ This is not sufficiently flexible to enforce security policies, in which different users have permission to access different subsets of the data

**DBMS**. A piece of software that is designed to make the above tasks easier
* *Explain*. By storing data in a DBMS, we can use the DBMS’s features to manage the data in a robust and efficient manner

    $\to$ As the volume of data and the number of users grow, DBMS support becomes indispensable

## Advantages of a DBMS
**Advantages of a DBMS**. In most situations for large-scale data management, DBMSs have become an indispensable tool
* *Data independence*. Application programs should be as independent as possible from details of data representation and storage
    
    $\to$ The DBMS can provide an abstract view of the data to insulate application code from such details
* *Efficient data access*. A DBMS utilizes a variety of sophisticated techniques to
store and retrieve data efficiently
    
    $\to$ This feature is especially important if the data is stored on external storage devices
* *Data integrity and security*. 
    * *Data integrity*. If data is always accessed through the DBMS
        
        $\to$ The DBMS can enforce integrity constraints on the data
        * *Example*. Before inserting salary information for an employee, the DBMS can check that the department budget is not exceeded
    * *Security*. The DBMS can enforce access controls governing what data is visible to different classes of users
* *Data administration*. When several users share the data, centralizing the administration of data can offer significant improvements
    * *Explain*. Experienced professionals, who understand the nature of the data being managed, and how different groups of users use it, can be responsible for
        * Organizing the data representation to minimize redundancy
        * Fine-tuning the storage of the data to make retrieval efficient
* *Concurrent access and crash recovery*. 
    * *Concurrent access*. A DBMS schedules concurrent accesses to the data
        
        $\to$ Hence users can think of the data as being accessed by only one user at a time
    * *Crash recovery*. The DBMS protects users from the effects of system failures
* *Reduced application development time*. 
    * *Development time*. Quick development of applications is facilitated, due to
        * The DBMS supports many important functions common to many applications accessing data
        * The DBMS provides high-level interface to the data
    * *Application robustness*. Such applications are also likely to be more robust than applications developed from scratch
        * *Explain*. Many important tasks are handled by the DBMS instead of being implemented by the application

**Drawback of DBMS**. 
* A DBMS is a complex piece of software, optimized for certain kinds of workloads, e.g., answering complex queries or handling many concurrent requests

    $\to$ Its performance may not be adequate for certain specialized applications
    * *Examples*.
        * Applications with tight real-time constraints
        * Applications with just a few well-defined critical operations, for which efficient custom code must be written
* An application may need to manipulate the data in ways not supported
by the query language

    $\to$ The abstract view of the data presented by the DBMS does not match the application’s needs
    * *Example*. Relational databases do not support flexible analysis of text data
* If specialized performance or data manipulation requirements are central to an application
    
    $\to$ The application may choose not to use a DBMS, especially if the added benefits of a DBMS are not required

## Describing and storing data in a DBMS
**Data model**. A collection of high-level data description constructs, which hide many low-level storage details

$\to$ A DBMS allows a user to define the data to be stored in terms of a data model
* *Construct*. Refer to an in-memory structure, like a C struct, which ideally allows the database to manage user requests better, e.g. like a plan for an already executed query
    * *Explain*. Having a plan, i.e. construct, in memory will improve the server's response time, since there is no need to read disks and recheck indexes
* *Common data models*. Different data models contain a wide variety of constructs that help describe a real application scenario
    * *Relational data model*. Most DBMS today are based on relational data model
    * *Semantic data model*. A more abstract, high-level data model, which makes it easier for a user to come up with a good initial description of the data in an enterprise
        * *Motivation*. The data model of the DBMS is close to how the DBMS stores data, than to how a user thinks about the underlying enterprise
        * *Entity-relationship (ER) model*. A widely used semantic data model allowing users to pictorially denote entities and the relationships among them

**Database design**. DBMS is not intended to support all these constructs directly

$\to$ It is typically built around a data model with just a few basic constructs, e.g. the relational model
* *Design procedure*.
    1. A database design in terms of a semantic model serves as a useful starting point
    2. The database design is subsequently translated into a database design in terms of the data model the DBMS actually supports

### The relational model
**Schema**. A description of data, in terms of a data model

**The relational model**. The central data description construct in relational model is relation
* *Relation*. A set of records having the same attributes
* *Schema for a relation*. Specify the relation name, the name of each field, i.e. or attribute or column, and the type of each field
    * *Example*. The following schema

        ```
        Students(sid: string, name: string, login: string, age: integer, gpa: real)
        ```

        will result in a relation, with an example instance given below

        <div style="text-align:center">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/GOBvJMs.png">
            <figcaption>An instance of the Students relation</figcaption>
        </div>

* *Record*. Each row in a relation is a record describing a student, and every row follows the schema of the Students relation

    $\to$ The schema can be regarded as a template for describing a student    

**Ingerity constraints**. Used to make the description of a collection of records more precise
* *Ingerity constraints*. Conditions that the records in a relation must satisfy
    * *Example*. Every student must have a unique `sid` value

#### Other data models
**Other data models**.
* The hierarchical model, i.e. used by IBM's IMS DBMS
* The network model, i.e. used in IDS and IDMS
* The object-oriented model, i.e. used in Objectstore and Versant
* The object-relational model, i.e. used in DBMS products from IBM, Informix, Objectstore, Oracle, Versant, etc.

### Levels of abstraction in a DBMS
**Levels of abstraction in a DBMS**. The database description consists of a schema at each of these three levels of abstraction: the conceptual, physical, and external schemas

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/VPpCXdg.png">
    <figcaption>Levels of abstraction in a DBMS</figcaption>
</div>
* *Data definition language (DDL)*. Used to define the external and conceptual schemas
    * *Example*. SQL
* *System catalogs*. Store information about the conceptual, external, and physical schemas

#### Conceptual schema
**Conceptual schema (or logical schema)**. Describe the stored data in terms of the data model of the DBMS
* *Conceptual schema in relational DBMS*. Describe all relations stored in the database
    * *Example*. In the sample university database, these relations contain information about 
        * Entities, e.g. students and faculty
        * Relationships, e.g. students’ enrollment in courses
* *Representation of entities and relationships in conceptual schema*. Each collection of entities and each collection of relationships can be described as a relation, e.g.

    ```
    Students(sid: string, name: string, login: string, age: integer, gpa: real)
    Faculty(fid: string, fname: string, sal: real)
    Courses(cid: string, cname: string, credits: integer)
    Rooms(rno:L integer, address: string, capacity: integer)
    Enrolled(sid: string, cid: string, grade: string)
    Teaches(fid: string, cid: string)
    Meets_In(cid: string, rno: integer, time: string)
    ```

**Conceptual database design**. The process of arriving at a good conceptual schema
* *Explain*. The choice of relations, and the choice of fields for each relation, is not always obvious

#### Physical schema
**Physical schema**. Specify additional storage details

$\to$ Essentially, the physical schema summarizes how the relations in the conceptual schema are actually stored on secondary storage devices, e.g. disks and tapes
* *Problems of interest*.
    * What file organizations to use to store the relations
    * Create auxiliary data structures, i.e. indexes, to speed up data retrieval operations
* *Example*.
    * Store all relations as unsorted files of records
    * Create indexes on 
        * The first column of the Students, Faculty, and Courses relations
        * The `sal` column of Faculty
        * The `capacity` column of Rooms.

**Physical schema design**. The process of arriving at a good physical schema

>**NOTE**. Decisions about the physical schema are based on an understanding of how the data is typically accessed

#### External schema
**External schemas**. Allow data access to be customized, and authorized, at the level of individual users or groups of users
* *Number of external schemas*.  There may be several external schemas, each tailored to a particular group of users
    * *Number of conceptual and physical schemas*. Any given database has exactly one conceptual schema and one physical schema
        * *Explain*. it has just one set of stored relations
* *External schema structure*. Each external schema consists of a collection of one or more views and relations from the conceptual schema
    * *View*. Conceptually a relation, but the records in a view are not stored in the DBMS

        $\to$ They are computed using a definition for the view, in terms of relations stored in the DBMS

**External schema design**. Guided by end user requirements
* *Example*. We might want to allow students to find out the names of faculty members teaching courses, as well as course enrollments
    
    $\to$ This can be done by defining the following view

    ```
    Courseinfo(cid: string, fname: string, enrollment: integer)
    ```

* *User and view*. A user can treat a view just like a relation and ask questions about the records in the view
* *View storage and computation*. Even though the records in the view are not stored explicitly, they are computed as needed
    * *Explain*. Some relation can be computed from the relations in the conceptual schema, and to store it in addition would be redundant
        
        $\to$ Such redundancy, in addition to the wasted space, could lead to inconsistencies

### Data independence
**Data independence**. Application programs are insulated from changes in the way the data is structured and stored
* *Implementation*. Implemented through use of the three levels of data abstraction
    
    $\to$ The conceptual schema and the external schema provide distinct benefits in this area

**Logical data independence**. Relations in the external schema, i.e. view relations, are in principle generated on demand from the relations in the conceptual schema
* *Consequence*. If the underlying data is reorganized, i.e. the conceptual schema is changed
    
    $\to$ The definition of a view relation can be modified so that the same relation is computed as before
* *Logical data independence*. Users can be shielded from changes in the logical structure of the data, or changes in the choice of relations to be stored

**Physical data independence**. The conceptual schema insulates users from changes in the physical storage of the data
* *Explain*. The conceptual schema hides details, e.g. how the data is actually laid out on disk, the file structure, and the choice of indexes
    
    $\to$ If the conceptual schema remains unchanged, we can change these storage details without altering applications
    
    >**NOTE**. Performance might be affected by such changes

## Queries in a DBMS
**Brief**. The ease with which information can be obtained from a database often determines its value to a user

$\to$ Relational database systems allow a rich class of questions to be posed easily

**Queries**. Questions involving the data stored in a DBMS
* *Query language*. A specialized language provided by the DBMS provides, in which queries can be posed
    
    $\to$ A very attractive feature of the relational model is that it supports powerful
query languages
    * *Relational calculus*. A formal query language based on mathematical logic, and queries in this language have an intuitive, precise meaning
    * *Relational algebra*. Another formal query language, based on a collection of operators for manipulating relations, which is equivalent in power to the calculus
* *Query optimization*. A DBMS takes great care to evaluate queries as efficiently as possible
    * *Indexing*. The efficiency of query evaluation is determined to a large extent by how the data is stored physically

        $\to$ Indexes can be used to speed up many queries
        * *Explain*. A good choice of indexes for the underlying relations can speed up queries

**Data manipulation language (DML)**. A tool, through which the DBMS enables users to create, modify, and query data

$\to$ The query language is only one part of the DML, which also provides constructs to insert, delete, and modify data
* *Data sublanguage*. The DML and DDL are collectively referred to as the data sublanguage when embedded within a host language, e.g. C or COBOL

## Transaction management
**Transaction management problems**. 
* *Concurrent access management*. When several users accessm, and possibly modify, a database concurrently

    $\to$ The DBMS must order their requests carefully to avoid conflicts
* *System failure protection*. The DBMS must protect users from the effects of system failures
    
    $\to$ The DMBS must ensure that all data, and the status of active applications, is restored to a consistent state when the system is restarted after a crash
    * *Examples*. Consider a system admin asking for a reservation to be made
        * If the DBMS responds saying that the reservation has been made
            
            $\to$ The reservation should not be lost if the system crashes
        * If the DBMS has not yet responded to the request, but is in the process of making the necessary changes to the data while the crash occurs
            
            $\to$ The partial changes should be undone when the system comes back up

**Transaction**. Any one execution of a user program in a DBMS

>**NOTE**. Executing the same program several times will generate several transactions

* *Atomicity*. This is the basic unit of change as seen by the DBMS, i.e. 
    * Partial transactions are not allowed
    * The effect of a group of transactions is equivalent to some serial execution of all transactions

### Concurrent execution of transactions
**Concurrent access management**. Schedule concurrent accesses to data so that each
user can safely ignore other concurrent data accesses
* *Importance of concurrent access management*. Cannot be underestimated
    * *Explain*. A database is typically shared by a large number of users, who 
        * Submit their requests to the DBMS independently, and 
        * Cannot be expected to deal with arbitrary changes being made concurrently by other users
* *Objective*. Allow users to think of their programs as if they were executing
in isolation, one after the other in some order chosen by the DBMS

**Locking protocol**. A set of rules to be followed by each transaction, and enforced
by the DBMS, to ensure that, even though actions of several transactions might be interleaved

$\to$ The net effect is identical to executing all transactions in some serial order
* *Lock*. A mechanism used to control access to database objects
    * *Types of locks*.
        * *Shared lock on an object*. Can be held by two different transactions at the same time
        * *Exclusive lock on an object*. No other transactions can hold any lock on the locked object
* *Locking protocol idea*. 
    1. Every transaction begins by obtaining 
        * A shared lock on each data object that it needs to read, and
        * An exclusive lock on each data object that it needs to modify
    2. The transaction then then releases all its locks after completing all actions 

### Incomplete transactions and system crashes
**Problem**. Transactions can be interrupted before running to completion

$\to$ A DBMS must ensure that the changes made by such incomplete transactions are removed from the database

**Write-ahead log (WAL)**. The DBMS maintains a log of all writes to the database
* *Idea*. Each write action must be recorded in the log, i.e. on disk, before the change is reflected in the database
    * *Explain*. Otherwise, if the system crashes just after making the change in the database, but before the change is recorded in the log
        
        $\to$ The DBMS would be unable to detect and undo this change
* *Requirement to enforce WAL*. The DBMS must be able to selectively force a collection of pages in main memory to disk
* *Commiting transactions*. The log is also used to ensure that the changes made by a successfully completed transaction are not lost due to a system crash

**Restoration after system crash**. Bringing the database to a consistent state after a system crash can be a slow process
* *Explain*.
    * The DBMS must ensure that the effects of all transactions that completed prior to the crash are restored
    * The effects of incomplete transactions are undone
* *Checkpoint*. The time required to recover from a crash can be reduced by periodically forcing some information to disk, i.e. create checkpoint

    >**NOTE**. This must be balanced against the fact that checkpointing too often slows down normal execution

## Structure of a DBMS
**Simplified typical DBMS based on the relational data model**.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZTK7Hfl.png">
    <figcaption>Architecture of a DBMS</figcaption>
</div>

* *Transaction execution*. 
    1. The DBMS accepts SQL commands generated from a variety of user interfaces
    2. The DBMS produces query evaluation plans
    3. The DBMS executes these plans against the database
    4. The DBMS returns the answers
    
    >**NOTE**. This is a simplification, i.e. SQL commands can be embedded in hostlanguage application programs, e.g., Java or COBOL programs

**Main components**.
* *Query optimizer*. When a user issues a query, the parsed query is handed to a query optimizer
    * *Responsibility*. Use information about how the data is stored to produce an efficient execution plan for evaluating the query
    * *Execution plan*. A blueprint for evaluating a query
        * *Representation*. A tree of relational operators, with annotations containing additional detailed information about which access methods to use, etc.
    * *Relational operators*. The building blocks for evaluating queries posed against the data

        $\to$ The implementation code of relational operators sits on top of the file and access methods layer
* *File and access methods layer*. Include a variety of software for supporting the concept of a file
    * *File in DBMS*. A collection of pages or a collection of records
        * *Heap file*. This layer typically supports a heap file, i.e. file of unordered pages, and indexes
    * *Responsibility*.
        * Keep track of the pages in a file
        * Organize the information within a page
* *Buffer manager*. Bring pages in from disk to main memory as needed in response to read requests
* *Disk space manager*. Deal with management of space on disk, where the data is stored
    
    $\to$ Higher layers allocate, deallocate, read, and write pages through routines provided by this layer

**Concurrency and crash recovery components**. The DBMS supports concurrency and crash recovery by carefully scheduling user requests and maintaining a log of all changes to the database

$\to$ The disk space manager, buffer manager, and file and access method layers must interact with the following components
* *Transaction manager*. 
    * Ensure that transactions request and release locks according to a suitable locking protocol 
    * Schedule the execution transactions
* *Lock manager*. Keep track of requests for locks and grants locks on database objects when they become available
* *Recovery manager*. Responsible for maintaining a log, and restoring the system to a consistent state after a crash

## People who deal with databases
**Database implementators**. Build DBMS software

$\to$ Database implementors work for vendors such as IBM or Oracle

**End users**. Wish to store and use data in a DBMS

$\to$ End users come from a diverse and increasing number of fields

**Database application programmers**. Develop packages that facilitate data access
for end users  using the host or data languages and software tools provided by DBMS vendors

>**NOTE**. Tools provided by DBMS vendors include report writers, spreadsheets, statistical packages, etc.

* *Consequence*. Application programs should ideally access data through the external schema

    >**NOTE**. It is possible to write applications that access data at a lower level, but such applications would compromise data independence

**Database administrator**. Design and maintain the database, i.e.
* *Design of the conceptual and physical schemas*. 
    1. Interact with the users of the system to understand 
        * What data is to be stored in the DBMS
        * How data is likely to be used
    2. Based on this knowledge, design the conceptual schema and the physical schema
    3. Possibly also design widely used portions of the external schema
        
        >**NOTE**. Users will probably augment this schema by creating additional views

* *Security and authorization*. Ensure that unauthorized data access is not permitted
    
    $\to$ In general, not everyone should be able to access all the data
    * *Idea*. Users can be granted permission to access only certain views and relations
* *Data availability and recovery from failures*.
    * *Responsibility*. 
        * Ensure that if the system fails, users can continue to access as much of the uncorrupted data as possible
        * Restore the data to a consistent state after system failure
    * *DBMS tools*. The DBMS provides software support for these functions
        
        $\to$ The DBA is responsible for implementing procedures to back up the data periodically, and to maintain logs of system activity
* *Database tuning*. The needs of users are likely to evolve with time
    
    $\to$ The DBA is responsible for modifying the database, in particular the conceptual and physical schemas, to ensure adequate performance as user requirements change

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Relation and table**. In a relational database, the table is a relation because it stores the relation between data in its column-row format
* *Relation in mathematics*. A relation is an association between, or property of, various objects
    * *Representation*. Relations can be represented by sets of ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a$ bears a relation to $b$
        * *Example*. Sets of ordered pairs are commonly used to represent relations depicted on charts and graphs, e.g. 
            * Calendar years may be paired with automobile production figures
            * Weeks with stock market averages
            * Days with average temperatures
    * *Example*. A function $f$ can be regarded as a relation between each $x\in\mathbf{dom} f$ and $f(x)$
* *Relation in relational model*. Consider the following schema

    ```
    Citizen(Social_Security_Number, Name, Home_Address)
    ```

    then the relation in the sense of set theory, is `xRy` where the relation `R` is defined as `x` is a citizen living in `y`, where we define `y` as a city

>**NOTE**. A query can also return a new relation, i.e. it returns a set of data defined by a new relation

**Mathematical formulation of relation**.
* *Domain*. The original sets of atomic values used to model data

    $\to$ A domain is a set of acceptable values that a column is allowed to contain
    * *Atomic value*. Refer to the fact that each value in the domain is indivisible as far as the relational model is concerned
    * *Examples*.
        * The domain of Marital Status has a set of possibilities: Married, Single, Divorced
        * The domain of Salary is the set of all floating-point numbers greater than 0 and less than 200,000
* *Relation (or table or file)*. A subset of the Cartesian product of a list of domains characterized by a name
    * *Table*. A database is composed of multiple tables and each table holds the data 
        
        $\to$ Within a table, each row represents a group of related data values
        * *Tuple*. A row, or record, is also known as a tuple
        * *Attribute*. The columns in a table is a field and is referred to as an attribute
    * *Logic between relation and domains*. Given $n$ domains $D_1,\dots,D_n$, then a relation $r$ defined on these domains are given as

        $$r\subseteq D_1\times \dots \times D_n$$

**File in a DBMS**. Either a collection of records or a collection of pages, rather than a string of characters as in an operating system
