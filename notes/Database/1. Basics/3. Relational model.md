# Relational model
**Benefits of relational model**. The relational model is very simple and elegant, i.e.
* A database is a collection of one or more relations, where each relation is a table with rows and columns
    * *Consequences*. 
        * Enable novice users to understand the contents of a database,
        * Permit the use of simple, high-level languages to query the data
* Simple data representation and the ease, with which even complex queries can be expressed

## Introduction to relational model
**Relation**. The main construct for representing data in the relational model
* *Relation*. Consist of a relation schema and a relation instance
    * *Degree (or arity) of a relation*. The number of fields
    * *Cardinality of a relation instance*. The number of tuples in it
* *Relation instance*. A set of tuples, or record
    * *Tuple*. Each tuple has the same number of fields as the relation schema
    * *Relation instance and table*. A relation instance is similar to a table, i.e. 
        * Each tuple is a row
        * All rows have the same number of fields
    * *Requirements*. 
        * *Uniqueness*. No two rows are identical, i.e. each relation is a set of unique tuples or rows
        * *Row order*. The row order is not important, however, a convention is to list fields in a specific order, and to refer to a field by its position

            $\to$ If this convention is used, the field order is significant
            * *Common practice*. Use a combination of the two conventions, e.g. named fields in GET statements, and ordered fields for UPDATE statements
* *Relation schema*. Describe the column heads for the table. We first
    
    $\to$ The schema specifies the relation’s name, the name of each field, and the domain of each field
    * *Domain*. Referred to, in a relation schema, by the domain name and have a set of associated values

**Domain**.
* *Domain constraint*. The values that appear in a column must be drawn from the associated domain

    $\to$ The domain of a field is essentially the type of the field
* *Formal description*.
    * *Assumptions*.
        * $R(f_1:D_1,\dots,f_n:D_n)$ is a relation schema
        * For each $1\leq i\leq n$, $\text{Dom}_i$ is the set of values associated with the domain $D_i$
    * *Conclusion*. An instance of $R$ satisfying the domain constraints in the schema is a set of tuples with $n$ fields

        $$\{\langle f_1:d_1,\dots,f_n:d_n \range : d_1\in\text{Dom}_1,\dots,d_n\in\text{Dom}_n\}$$
* *Conclusion*. Domain constraints are so fundamental in the relational model, hence we consider only relation instances that satisfy them
    
    $\to$ Relation instance means relation instance satisfying the domain constraints in the relation schema

**Relational database**. A collection of relations with distinct relation names
* *Relational database schema*. The collection of schemas for the relations in the database
* *Relational database instance*. A collection of relation instances, one per relation schema in the database schema

### Creation and modification of relations with SQL
**Create table**.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Students ( sid CHAR(20),
                        name CHAR(30),
                        login CHAR(20),
                        age INTEGER,
                        gpa REAL )
```

**Insert tuples to table**.

```sql
INSERT
INTO Students (sid, name, login, age, gpa)
VALUES (53688, ‘Smith’, ‘smith@ee’, 18, 3.2)
```

**Delete tuples from table**.

```sql
DELETE
FROM Students S
WHERE S.name = ‘Smith’
```

**Modify column values in an existing row**.

```sql
UPDATE Students S
SET S.age = S.age + 1, S.gpa = S.gpa - 1
WHERE S.sid = 53688
```

## Integrity constraints over relations
**Brief**. A database is only as good as the information stored in it

$\to$ A DBMS must help prevent the entry of incorrect information

**Integrity constraint (IC)**. A condition specified on a database schema, which restricts the data that can be
stored in an instance of the database
* *Legal database instance*. A database instance satisfies all the integrity constraints specified on the database schema
* *IC enforcement*. The DBMS permits only legal instances to be stored in the database

**IC specification and enforcement**.
* *Specification*. When the DBA or end user defines a database schema
    
    $\to$ He specifies the ICs that must hold on any instance of this database
* *Enforcement*. When a database application is run
    
    $\to$ The DBMS checks for violations and disallows changes to the data that violate the specified ICs
    * *Alternative approach*. Rather than disallow the change
        
        $\to$ The DBMS makes some compensating changes to the data to ensure that the database instance satisfies all ICs

**Types of ICs**. Many kinds of integrity constraints can be specified in the relational model
* *Example*. No two students have the same sid value

### Key constraints
**Key constraint**. A statement that a certain minimal subset of the fields of a relation is a unique identifier for a tuple
* *Candidate key (or key) of a relation*. A set of fields that uniquely identifies a tuple according to a key constraint
    * *Explain*.
        * Two distinct tuples in a legal instance cannot have identical values in all the fields of a key
        * No subset of the set of fields in a key is a unique identifier for a tuple
    * *Number of candidate keys*. A relation may have several candidate keys
* *Superkey*. A set of fields containing a key
* *Existence of key*. Every relation is guaranteed to have a key
    * *Explain*. Since a relation is a set of tuples, the set of all fields is always a superkey
        
        $\to$ If other constraints hold, some subset of the fields may form a key, otherwise, the set of all fields is a key

**Primary key**. Out of all the available candidate keys, a database designer can identify a primary key

$\to$ A tuple can be referred to from elsewhere in the database by storing the values of its primary key fields
* *Primary key and other keys*. In principle, we can use any key, not just the primary key, to refer to a tuple
    
    $\to$ However, using the primary key is preferable since it is what the DBMS expects and optimizes for
    * *Explain*. This is the significance of designating a particular candidate key as a primary key
        * *Example*. DBMS may create an index with the primary key fields as the search key, to make the retrieval of a tuple given its primary key value efficient

**Specifying key constraints in SQL**.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Students ( sid CHAR(20),
                        name CHAR(30),
                        login CHAR(20),
                        age INTEGER,
                        gpa REAL,
                        UNIQUE (name, age), -- specify candidate key
                        CONSTRAINT StudentsKey PRIMARY KEY (sid) ) -- specify primary key constraint named ``StudentKey``
```

### Foreign key constraints
**Brief**. Sometimes the information stored in a relation is linked to the information stored in another relation

$\to$ If one of the relations is modified, the other must be checked, and perhaps modified, to keep the data consistent
* *Consequence*. An IC involving both relations must be specified if a DBMS is to make such checks

**Foreign key constraint**. The most common IC involving two relations
* *Foreign key constraint*. A set of attributes in a table that refers to the primary key of another table
* *Requirements*. The foreign key in the referencing relation must match the primary key of the referenced relation 
    * *Explain*. It must have the same number of columns and compatible data types, although the column names can be different

**Loop-back foreign key**. A foreign key could refer to the same relation
* *Example*. We could extend the `Students` relation with a column `partner` and declare this column to be a foreign key referring to `Students`

**Null**. The use of null in a field of a tuple means that value in that field is either unknown or not applicable 
* *Null foreign key*. The appearance of null in a foreign key field does not violate the foreign key constraint
* *Null primary key*. Null values are not allowed to appear in a primary key field
    * *Explain*. The primary key fields are used to identify a tuple uniquely

**Referential integrity**. A property of data stating that all its references are valid

**Specifying foreign key constraint in SQL**.

```sql
REATE TABLE Enrolled ( sid CHAR(20),
                        cid CHAR(20),
                        grade CHAR(10),
                        PRIMARY KEY (sid, cid),
                        FOREIGN KEY (sid) REFERENCES Students )
```

### General constraints
**General constraints**. Current relational DBMSs support such general constraints in the form of table constraints and assertions
* *Table constraints*. Associated with a single table and are checked whenever that table is modified
* *Assertions*. Involve several tables and are checked whenever any of these tables is modified
* *Constraint specification*. Both table constraints and assertions can use the full power of SQL queries to specify the desired restriction

## Enforcing integrity constraints
**Brief**. Potential IC violation is generally checked at the end of each SQL statement execution, although it can be deferred until the end of the transaction executing the statement

**Foreign key constraint enforcement**. The impact of foreign key constraints is more complex
* *Explain*. SQL sometimes tries to rectify a foreign key constraint violation instead of simply rejecting the change
* *Referential integrity enforcement steps*. SQL-92 provides several alternative ways to handle foreign key violations
    * What should we do if referential integrity constraint is violated via `INSERT` operator?
        
        $\to$ In this case the `INSERT` command is rejected
    * What should we do if a referenced row is deleted?
        * *Option 1*. Delete all referencing rows that refer to the deleted referenced row
        * *Option 2*. Disallow the deletion of the referenced row if an referencing row refers to it
        * *Option 3*. For every referencing row that refers to the deleted referenced row
            
            $\to$ Set the foreign key column to the primary key of some existing default row in the referenced table
        * *Option 4*. For every referencing row that refers to it, set the foreign key column to null
    * What should we do if the primary key value of a referenced row is updated?
        
        $\to$ The options here are similar to the previous case
* *Implementation in SQL*. SQL-92 allows us to choose any of the four options on `DELETE` and `UPDATE` via `ON DELETE` and `ON UPDATE`

## Querying relational data
**Relational database query (or query)**. A question about the data, and the answer consists of a new relation containing the result
* *Query language*. A specialized language for writing queries, e.g. SQL

## Logical database design - ER to relational
**Brief**. This section describes how to translate an ER diagram into a collection of tables with associated constraints, i.e. a relational database schema

### Entity sets to tables
**Entity sets to tables**. Each attribute of the entity set becomes an attribute of the table
* *Requirements*. Both the domain of each attribute and the (primary) key of an entity set are known

### Relationship sets without constraints to tables
**Relationship sets without constraints to tables**. A relationship set, like an entity set, is mapped to a relation in the relational model
* *Requirements*.
    * We must be able to identify each participating entity
    * We must be able to give values to the descriptive attributes of the relationship
* *Relation attributes*. Must include
    * The primary key attributes of each participating entity set, as foreign key fields
    * The descriptive attributes of the relationship set
* *Relationship key*. The set of nondescriptive attributes is a superkey for the relation
    
    $\to$ If there are no key constraints, this set of attributes is a candidate key

### Translating relationship sets with key constraints
**Translating relationship sets with key constraints**. Consider a relationship set involves $n$ entity sets, and some $m$ of them are linked via arrows in the ER diagram
* *Option 1*. The key for any one of these $m$ entity sets constitutes a key for the relation, to which the relationship set is mapped
    
    $\to$ We have $m$ candidate keys, and one of these should be designated as the primary key
    * *Pros*. Avoid null cells
    * *Cons*. Some important queries require combined information from two relations, which can be a slow operation
* *Option 2*. Superior option since it avoids creating a distinct table for the relationship set
    * *Idea*. Include the information about the relationship set in the table of the entity set with the key
    * *Pros*. This takes advantage of the key constraint
    * *Cons*. Space could be wasted if several entity in a set does not have any relationship with some other entities in some other sets

        $\to$ In this case, the added fields are filled with null values

### Translating relationship sets with participation constraints
**Translating relationship sets with participation constraints**. Use the second option of translating relationship sets with key constraints
* *Enforce participation constraints*. Use foreign key constraint
    * *Idea*. If an entity set $E$ has a total participation constraint in a relationship set $R$

        $\to$ We include information about the relationship set in the table of $E$

    >**NOTE**. Participation constraints cannot be captured with option 1

* *Example*. To capture the participation constraint that every department must have a manager, we use the following SQL command

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Dept Mgr ( did INTEGER,
                            dname CHAR(20),
                            budget REAL,
                            ssn CHAR(11) NOT NULL,
                            since DATE,
                            PRIMARY KEY (did),
                            FOREIGN KEY (ssn) REFERENCES Employees
                            ON DELETE NO ACTION )
    ```

* *Explain*. 
    * Since `ssn` cannot take on null values
    
        $\to$ Each tuple of `Dept Mgr` identifies a tuple in `Employees`, i.e. the manager
    * By using `NO ACTION` specification, which is the default and need not be explicitly specified
        
        $\to$ We ensure that an Employees tuple cannot be deleted while it is pointed to by a `Dept Mgr` tuple

**Participation constraints with table constraints and assertions**. There are many participation constraints which cannot be captured by SQL, short of using table constraints and assertions
* *Table constraints and assertions*. Can be specified using the full power of the SQL query language
    * *Pros and cons*. Very expressive but very expensive to check and enforce
* *Example 1*. We cannot enforce the participation constraints on the `Works In` relation without using these general constraints

    <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/C9ldksz.png">
        <figcaption>Example ER diagram</figcaption>
    </div>

    * *Explain*. To ensure total participation of Departments in `Works In`
        
        $\to$ Every `did` value in `Departments` must appear in a tuple of `Works In`
    * *Naive solution*. Declare that `did` in `Departments` is a foreign key referring to `Works In`

        $\to$ Due to referential integrity constraints, only departments in `Works In` are allowed to be listed in `Departments`
        * *Problem*. This is not a valid foreign key constraint, since `did` is not a candidate key for `Works In`
    * *Valid solution*. Use assertion
        * *Idea*. We have to guarantee that 
            * Every `did` value in `Departments` appears in a tuple of `Works In`
            * This tuple of `Works In` must also have non null values in foreign keys referencing other entity sets involved in the relationship, e.g. `ssn`
                
                $\to$ We can ensure the second part of this constraint by imposing the stronger requirement that `ssn` in `Works In` cannot contain null values
* *Example 2*. We need assertions to express the requirement that each `Employees` entity must manage at least one department

    >**NOTE**. `Manages` represents most of the participation constraints, which can be captured using key and foreign key constraints
    
    * *Observations*. `Manages` is a binary relationship set, in which 
        * Only one of the e
    CREATE TABLE Dep Policy ( pname CHAR(20),
                            age INTEGER,
                            cost REAL,
                            ssn CHAR(11),
                            PRIMARY KEY (pname, ssn),
                            FOREIGN KEY (ssn) REFERENCES Employees
                            ON DELETE CASCADE )
    ```ntity sets, i.e. `Departments`, has a key constraint
        * The total participation constraint is expressed on that entity set
* *Example 3*. Consider a relationship set, in which all participating entity sets have key constraints and total participation
    * *Best translation approach*. Map all the entities and the relationship into a single table

### Translating weak entity sets
**Translating weak entity sets**. A weak entity set always participates in a one-to-many binary relationship and has a key constraint and total participation

$\to$ Use the second option of translating relationship sets with key constraints
* *Cautions*.
    * The weak entity has only a partial key
    * When an owner entity is deleted, all owned weak entities should be deleted
* *Example*.

    <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/0ZpYvRy.png">
        <figcaption>Example ER diagram</figcaption>
    </div>

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Dep_Policy ( pname CHAR(20),
                              age INTEGER,
                              cost REAL,
                              ssn CHAR(11),
                              PRIMARY KEY (pname, ssn),
                              FOREIGN KEY (ssn) REFERENCES Employees
                              ON DELETE CASCADE )
    ```

### Translating class hierarchies
**Basic approaches for handling ISA hierarchies**.
* *Option 1*. Map both base entity set and derived entity set to a distinct relation
    * *Idea*. The relation for derived class includes its own attributes, and the key attributes of the base class

    >**NOTE**. If the base class tuple is removed, the removal must be cascaded to the derived class

    * *Pros*. 
        * General and always applicable
        * Queries in which we want to examine all base class tuples, without caring about the derived class' attributes, are handled easily using the base class relation
    * *Cons*. Queries, in which we want to examine tuples of derived class, may require us to combine the base class and the derived class to retrieve all related information
* *Option 2*. Use a distinct relations for each derived class
    * *Pros*. A query, which needs to examine only tuples of a derived class, needs only examining one relation  
    * *Cons*. 
        * Not applicable if we have base class tuples which belongs to no derived class
        * Duplicate information if an entity belongs to more than one derived calss
            
            $\to$ This duplication can lead to some of the anomalies
        * A query that needs to examine all base class tuples must examine all relations
* *Conclusion*. The choice between these approaches clearly depends on the semantics of the data and the frequency of common operations

### Translating ER diagrams with aggregation
**Translating ER diagrams with aggregation**. Easy, i.e. there is no real distinction between entities and relationships in the relational model

## Introduction to views
**View**. A table, whose rows are not explicitly stored in the database but are computed as needed from a view definition

$\to$ Views can be used just like a base table, or explicitly stored table, in defining new queries or views
* *Example*.

    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW B-Students (name, sid, course)
           AS SELECT S.sname, S.sid, E.cid
           FROM Students S, Enrolled E
           WHERE S.sid = E.sid AND E.grade = `B`
    ```

* *Base table*. The table, from which the view is created

### Views, data independence, and security
**External schema via conceptual schema and views**. 
* *External schema via conceptual schema*. Some relations in the conceptual schema can also be exposed to applications
* *External schema via views*. Additional relations in the external schema can be defined using the view mechanism

    $\to$ The view mechanism thus provides the support for logical data independence in the relational model
    * *Explain*. Views can be used to define relations in the external schema that mask changes in the conceptual schema of the database from applications

**Views and security**. We can define views, which give a group of users access to the information they are allowed to see

### Updates on views
**Motivation of views**. To tailor how users see the data, i.e. users should not have to worry about the view versus base table distinction

$\to$ This goal is achieved in the case of queries on views
* *Explain*. A view can be used like other relations in defining a query
* *Updates on views*. It is natural to want to specify updates on views, while keeping the distinction between a view and a base table

**Updatable views**. The SQL-92 standard allows updates to be specified only on views defined on a single base table using only selection and projection, with no use of aggregate operations

$\to$ Such views are called updatable views
* *Idea*. An update on a restricted view can always be implemented by updating the underlying base table in an unambiguous way
* *Operations*.
    * *Update*. We can modify a row of a view by modifying the corresponding row in the base table

        >**NOTE**. This operation may change the base table so that the resulting row is not in the view

    * *Delete*. We can delete a row of a view by deleting the corresponding row in the base table
    * *Insert*. We can insert a row to a view by inserting a row to the base table, using null values in columns, which do not appear in the view
        * *Primary key constraint*. Primary key columns are not allowed to contain null values
            * *Consequence*. If we attempt to insert rows through a view without the primary key of the base table
                
                $\to$ The insertions will be rejected

        >**NOTE**. This operation may change the base table so that the resulting row is not in the view

**Nested views**. When a view is defined upon another view, the interaction between these view definitions w.r.t updates can be complex

#### Needs to restric view updates
**Restricted view updates**. There are some fundamental problems with updates specified on views

$\to$ There is good reason to limit the class of views that can be updated

## Destroying and alternating tables and views
**Destroy table**. If we decide that we no longer need a base table and want to destroy it, i.e. delete
all the rows and remove the table definition information

**Alternate table**. Modifies the structure of an existing table

## Other data models
### Hierarchical database model
**Hierarchical database model**. The earliest model was the hierarchical database model, resembling an upside-down tree

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/uvnlngq.png">
    <figcaption>Hierarchical database model</figcaption>
</div>

* *Idea*. Files are related in a parent-child manner, i.e.
    * Each parent capable of relating to more than one child
    * Each child only being related to one parent
* *Analogy*. This is the way most file systems work, i.e. there is usually a root, or top-level, directory that contains various other directories and files
    * *Giang's comment*. We can understand each record as an object, and attributes can be accessed by `.` operator

**Implementation**.
* *Records and links*. Data are stored as records, which are connected to one another through links
    * *Record*. A collection of fields, with each field containing only one value
    * *Record type*. Define which fields the record contains
* *Data segment*. Define the fields for a set of segment instances
    
    $\to$ This is similar to how relational table defines columns for a set of rows in a table
    * *Consequence*. 
        * Segments relate to relational tables
        * Fields in a segment relate to columns in a relational table

**Pros and cons**.
* *Pros*. This model is a vast improvement on dealing with unrelated files
* *Cons*. 
    * The model represents one-to-many relationships well, i.e. one parent has many children
        
        $\to$ However, it has problems with many-to-many relationships
    * The model is not flexible, i.e. adding new relationships can result in wholesale changes to the existing structure
        
        $\to$ All existing applications need to change as well
    * Developing the applications is complex
        * *Explain*. The programmer needs to know the data structure well in order to traverse the model to access the needed data, i.e.
            * When accessing data from two related tables, we should only need to know the fields you require from those two tables
            * In the hierarchical model, we need to know the entire chain between the two
        * *Example*. To relate data from A1 and D4, we need to take the route A1, B1, C3 and D4

**Differences between hierarchical model and related model**. 
* *Hierarchical model*. Segments are implicitly joined with each other

    * *Explain*. A segment instance is joined with its parent segment and its child segments, which are all along the same hierarchical path
* *Relational model*. We must explicitly join two tables

### Network database model
**Network database model**. A progression from the hierarchical database model

$\to$ This is designed to solve some of that hierarchical model's problems, specifically the lack of flexibility
* *Idea*. Instead of only allowing each child to have one parent, each child can have multiple parents 
    
    $\to$ The children are called members, and the parents are called owners
* *Pros*. This model addresses the need to model more complex relationships, e.g. many-to-many relationship
* *Cons*. 
    * It is more difficult to implement and maintain, i.e.
        * *Consequence*. Increase burden on programmer for database design and data manipulation
            
            $\to$ In relational model, physical level details are hidden from end users, making this model simple to understand
    * Although more flexible than the hierarchical model
        
        $\to$ It still has flexibility problems
    * Not all relations can be satisfied by assigning another owner
        
        $\to$ The programmer still has to understand the data structure well to make the model efficient
* *Main differences from relational model*.
    * *Record organization*.
        * Network model organizes records to one another through links or pointers
        * Relational model organizes records in form of table, and relationship between tables are set using common fields
    * *Relationship between various records*.
        * Network model represents physically via linked list
        * Relational model represents logically via tables

**Differences between network model and relational model**.
* *Network model*. The relationships between parent and child records is hard coded into the structure of the data using physical pointers or addresses
    
    $\to$ This difference between using physical addresses versus foreign keys to represent relationships is the main reason that relational databases supplanted network databases
    * *Relationship implementation*. Fully defined and locked in at create time and any changes or reorganization required the entire database to be completely rebuilt
        * *Examples*.
            * Adding a second telephone number field to a child record type would make the child records longer
                1. This causes the child “table” to have to be rebuild
                    * *Explain*. This would change the addresses of all of its records
                2. This would require that the associated parent records would have to be rebuilt
                    
                    $\to$ So that the parent records contain the newly modified child record addresses
                3. If this caused parent addresses to change
                    
                    $\to$ The child records of all related child record types also have to be rebuilt with the new parent record addresses
                * *Consequence*. One change could cascade into dozens of complex interlocked changes 
                    
                    $\to$ All had to be coordinated and completed perfectly, or some data would become unreachable and so virtually lost
            * Since both parents contained pointers to children and children contained pointers to parents
                
                $\to$ Adding another child record would require the parent record to grow, hence have to be rebuilt and cascade to rewriting all of its children
        * *Consequecne*. It quickly became a nightmare to maintain a CODASYL database as the world it was modeling changed over time
* *Relational model*. The relationships between parent, child, and sibling records in one or more tables is represented by foreign keys

    $\to$ The relational model is more flexible
    * *Examples*.
        * If we need to add a column to a child table
            
            $\to$ We simply alter the table to contain the new column
            * *Explain*. 
                * The relationship between parent and child is represented by a copy of the primary key from the parent included in the child record as a foreign key
                * That key does not change, hence we are done and the data is safe and complete
        * If we needed to add another child row, we simply did that
        * If we need to add a completely new child type
            
            $\to$ We create a new table with the parent’s foreign key
        * If we need to model “step” relationships, i.e. a many-to-many relationship
            
            $\to$ We create a “relation” table with the keys of parents and children and eliminate the “parent” foreign key in the child records and poof
    * *Consequence*. No reorganization is required
        
        $\to$ That flexibility is the main difference

### MongoDB database model
**MongoDB database model**.
* *Key features*.
    * *Collections and documents*. Each database contains collections which in turn contains documents
        * *Document fields*. 
            * Each document can be different with a varying number of fields
            * The size and content of each document can be different from each other
        * *Document structure*. More aligned with how classes and objects are constructed in programming languages
            * *Explain*. Classes are not rows and columns but have a clear structure with key-value pairs
        * *Collection schema*. The rows (or documents as called in MongoDB) doesn’t need to have a schema defined beforehand
            
            $\to$ The fields can be created on the fly
    * *Data model available within MongoDB*. Allow us to represent hierarchical relationships, to store arrays, and other more complex structures more easily
    * *Scalability*. The MongoDB environments are very scalable
* *Example*.

    </div>

    * `_id` field is added by MongoDB to uniquely identify the document in the collection
    * Consider the field `Order(OrderID, Product, Quantity)`
        * In RDBMS will normally be stored in a separate table
        * In MongoDB it is actually stored as an embedded document in the collection itself
            
            $\to$ This is one of the key differences in how data is modeled in MongoDB

**Key components**.
* *`_id`*. A field required in every MongoDB document
    * *Purpose*. Represent a unique value in the MongoDB document
        
        $\to$ This field is the document’s primary key
        
    >**NOTE**. If you create a new document without `_id`, MongoDB will automatically create the field

* *Collection*. A group of MongoDB documents
    
    $\to$ This is equivalent to a table, which is created in RDMSs
    * *Collection and database*. A collection exists within a single database
    * *Collection schema*. Collections do not enforce any sort of structure
* *Cursor*. A pointer to a query's the result set
    
    $\to$ Clients can iterate through a cursor to retrieve results
* *Database*. A container for collections, i.e. like a container for tables in RDBMS
    * *Database storage*. Each database gets its own set of files on the file system
    
    >**NOTE**. A MongoDB server can store multiple databases

* *Document*. A record in a MongoDB collection, which consists of zero or more field name and values
* *Field*. A name-value pair in a document
    
    $\to$ Fields are analogous to columns in RDBMS
* *JSON*. JavaScript Object Notation, i.e. a human-readable, plain text format for expressing structured data

**Benefits**.
* *Document-oriented*. Since MongoDB is a NoSQL type database, instead of having data in a relational type format
    
    $\to$ It stores the data in documents
    * *Consequence*. MongoDB is very flexible and adaptable to real business world situation and requirements
* *Ad hoc queries*. 
    * MongoDB supports searching by field, range queries, and regular expression searches
    * Queries can be made to return specific fields within documents
* *Indexing*. Indexes can be created to improve the performance of searches within MongoDB
    
    $\to$ Any field in a MongoDB document can be indexed.
* *Replication*. MongoDB can provide high availability with replica sets
    * *Replica set*. Consist of two or more mongo DB instances
        * *Replica set member*. Each member may act in as the primary or secondary replica at any time
    * *Primary replica*. The main server, which interacts with the client and performs all the I/O operations
    * *Secondary replicas*. Maintain a copy of the data of the primary using built-in replication
    * *Data reliability*. When a primary replica fails
        
        $\to$ The replica set automatically switches over to the secondary and then it becomes the primary server
* *Load balancing*. 
    * *Horizontal scaling*. MongoDB uses sharding to scale horizontally by splitting data across multiple MongoDB instances
    * *Load balancing*. MongoDB can run over multiple servers, balancing the load and/or duplicating data
        
        $\to$ This keeps the system up and running in case of hardware failure

**Data modeling in MongoDB**. MongoDB’s collections do not enforce document structure

$\to$ This flexibility makes MongoDB so powerful
* *Rules of thumb*. When modeling data in Mongo, keep the following things in mind
    * *Application's needs*. Based on application's needs, ensure that the structure of the document is decided accordingly
    * *Data retrieval patterns*. Foresee heavy query usage to consider using indexes in our data model to improve query efficiency
    * *Frequent database update*. Reconsider the use of indexes or incorporate sharding if required in the data modeling design to improve database efficiency

# Appendix
## Concepts
**SQL aggregation function**. Functions operating on a group of rows, rather than a single row
* *Example*. `sum()`, `count()`, and `max()`

**SQL selection and projection**.
* *Projection*. Choosing which columns, or expressions, the query shall return.
* *Selection*. Choosing which rows are to be returned
