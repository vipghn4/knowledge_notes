# Entity-relationship model
**Entity-relationship (ER) data model**. Allow us to describe real-world data in terms of objects and their relationships and widely used to develop an initial database design

$\to$ The ER model is important primarily for its role in database design
* *ER model in database design*. Provide useful concepts allowing us to move from an informal description of what users want from their database to a more detailed, and precise, description that can be implemented in a DBMS

    $\to$ The ER model is used in conceptual database design phase

>**NOTE**. Many variations of ER diagrams are in use, and no widely accepted standards prevail

## Overview of database design
**Database design steps involving ER model**.
1. Requirements analysis
2. Conceptual database design
3. Logical database design

**Requirements analysis**. 
* *Objective*. Find out what the users want from the database, i.e.
    * What data is to be stored in the database
    * What applications must be built on top of it
    * What operations are most frequent and subject to performance requirements
* *Idea*. This is usually an informal process that involves 
    * Discussions with user groups
    * A study of the current operating environment and how it is expected to change
    * Analysis of available documentation on existing applications, which are expected to be replaced or complemented by the database
    * Other aspects

**Conceptual database design**. Given the information gathered in the requirements analysis step 

$\to$ Develop a high-level description of the data to be stored in the database, along with the constraints on the data
* *Idea*. This step is often carried out using the ER model, or a similar high-level data model

**Logical database design**. 
* *Idea*. 
    1. Choose a DBMS to implement our database design
    2. Convert the conceptual database design into a database schema in the data model of the chosen DBMS
    
>**NOTE**. We will only consider relational DBMSs, hence the task in the logical design step is to convert an ER schema into a relational database schema

* *Results*. A conceptual schema, i.e. the logical schema

### Beyond the ER model
**ER model and logical database schema**. ER modeling is sometimes regarded as a complete approach to designing a logical database schema

$\to$ This is incorrect
* *Explain*.  ER diagram is constructed through subjective evaluation of the information from requirements analysis
    
    $\to$ The ER diagram is just an approximate description of the data
    * *Consequence*. A more careful analysis can often refine the logical schema obtained at the end of step 3
* *Further steps after logical database design*. Once we have a good logical schema
    1. We must consider performance criteria and design the physical schema
    2. We must address security issues, and ensure that users are able to access the data they need, but not data that we wish to hide from them

**Remaining steps after logical database design**.
1. *Schema refinement*. Analyze the collection of relations in our relational database schema to identify potential problems, and to refine it
    * *Difference from the first two steps*.
        * *Requirements analysis and conceptual design steps*. Subjective
        * *Schema refinement*. Guided by some elegant and powerful theory. 
            * *Example*. Relation normalization, i.e. restructuring relations to ensure some desirable properties
2. *Physical database design*. Consider typical expected workloads, which our database must support
    
    $\to$ We then further refine the database design to ensure that it meets desired performance criteria
    * *Idea*. This step may simply involve 
        * Building indexes on some tables and clustering some tables, or
        * A substantial redesign of parts of the database schema obtained from the earlier steps
3. *Security design*. 
    1. Identify different user groups and different roles played by various users 
    2. For each role and user group, identify 
        * The parts of the database accessible to the role 
        * The parts of the database not accessible to the role
    3. Ensure that each role can access only the necessary parts
4. *Tuning phase (optional)*. All six kinds of design steps are interleaved and repeated until the design is satisfactory
5. *Database implementation*. Implement the database design, and desig and implement the application layers running on top of the DBMS

    >**NOTE**. These additional steps can lead to a rethinking of the basic database design

**Correct view on database design process**. The above steps should be seen as a classification of the kinds of steps involved in design

## Entities, attributes, and entity sets
**Entity**. An object in the real world, which is distinguishable from other objects.
* *Entity set*. It is often useful to identify a collection of similar entities
    
    $\to$ Such a collection is called an entity set
    
    >**NOTE**. Entity sets need not be disjoint

* *Attributes*. An entity is described using a set of attributes
    * *Attributes in entity set*. All entities in a given entity set have the same attributes
        
        $\to$ This is essentially what is meant by similar
    * *Choice of attributes*. Reflects the level of detail, at which we wish to represent information about entities
    * *Attribute domain*. For each attribute associated with an entity set
        
        $\to$ We must identify a domain of possible values
* *Key in entity set*. For each entity set, we choose a key
    * *Key*. A minimal set of attributes, whose values uniquely identify an entity in the set
    * *Candidate key*. There could be more than one candidate key
    * *Primary key*. We designate one of candidate keys as the primary key
    
    >**NOTE**. For now we will assume that, for each entity set, the set of attributes contains a key

* *Representation in diagram*.

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xupE5dc.png">
        <figcaption>Example of entity set diagram</figcaption>
    </div>

    * An entity set is represented by a rectangle
    * An attribute is represented by an oval
    * Each attribute in the primary key is underlined
    * The domain information could be listed along with the attribute name

## Relationship and relationship sets
**Relationship**. An association among two or more entities
* *Relationship set*. A set of similar relationships
* *Mathematical representation*. A relationship set can be thought of as a set of $n$-tuples

    $$\{(e_1,\dots,e_n):e_1\in E_1,\dots, e_n\in E_n\}$$

    * *Explain*. Each $n$-tuple denotes a relationship involving $n$ entities $e_1,\dots,e_n$
* *Descriptive attributes*. A relationship can also have descriptive attributes
    * *Purpose*. Used to record information about the relationship, rather than about any one of the participating entities
* *Identification of relationship*. A relationship must be uniquely identified by the participating entities, without reference to the descriptive attributes
* *Representation in diagram*.

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9iypy55.png">
        <figcaption>Example of relationship set diagram</figcaption>
    </div>

**Instance of a relationship set**. A set of relationships

$\to$ An instance is a snapshot of the relationship set at some instant in time

**Entity set and relationship set**. The entity sets that participate in a relationship set need not be distinct

$\to$ Sometimes a relationship may involve two entities in the same entity set
* *Role*. Two entities in the same entity set and in a relationship should play different roles

    $\to$ Such a role is reflected in the role indicators

    <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/SLNvAgP.png">
        <figcaption>Role indicator example</figcaption>
    </div>

* *Entity identification by role*. If an entity set plays more than one role
    
    $\to$ The role indicator concatenated with an attribute name from the entity set gives us a unique name for each attribute in the relationship set

## Additional features of the ER model
### Key constraints
**Key constraints**. If an entity set $E$ has a key constraint in a relationship set $R$

$\to$ Each entity in an instance of $E$ appears in at most one relationship in a corresponding instance of $R$
* *Representation in diagram*. Use arrow, from $E$ to $R$

**Types of relationships**. One-to-many, or many-to-many, or many-to-one, or one-to-one

### Participation constraints
**Participation constraints**. 
* *Total participation*. If an entity set $E$ has a total participation constraint in a relationship set $R$

    $\to$ Each entity in an instance of $E$ appears in at least one relationship in a corresponding instance of $R$
    * *Representation in diagram*. A think line between $E$ and $R$
* *Partial participation*. If an entity set $E$ has a partial participation constraint in a relationship set $R$

    $\to$ Each entity in an instance of $E$ may or may not appear in a relationship in a corresponding instance of $R$

### Weak entities
**Brief**. Currently, we have assumed that the attributes associated with an entity set include a key

$\to$ This assumption does not always hold

**Weak entity set**. A weak entity can be identified uniquely only by considering some of its attributes in conjunction with the primary key of another entity
* *Identifying owner*. The primary key of other entity, which uniquely identifies a weak entity
* *Restrictions for weak entities*.
    * The owner entity set and the weak entity set must participate in a one-to-many relationship set, but each weak entity has a single owner

        $\to$ This relationship set is called the identifying relationship set of the weak entity set
        * *Explain*. One owner entity is associated with one or more weak entities
    * The weak entity set must have total participation in the identifying relationship set

        $\to$ Otherwise, they cannot be identified uniquely
* *Representation in diagram*. 
    * Both the weak entity set and the owner entity set are drawn with dark lines
    * The partial key for the weak entity set is underlined using a broken line

**Example**. Suppose that employees can purchase insurance policies to cover their dependents

$\to$ We wish to record information about policies, including who is covered by each policy
* *Dependent relation*. A dependent is identified by name alone in this situation
    * *Explain*. It is reasonable to expect that the dependents of a given employee have different names

    ```
    Dependent(pname: string, age: integer)
    ```

* *Dependent identification*. The attribute `pname` does not identify a dependent uniquely

    $\to$ We use employee ID in combination to identify each dependent

### Class hierarchies
**Brief**. Sometimes it is natural to classify the entities in an entity set into subclasses
* *Example*. Classify `Employees` by `Hourly_Emps` and `Contract_Emps`

**Entity set inheritance**. The derived entity set is said to inherit from the base entity set, and any instance of the derived entity set ISA, i.e. "is a", base entity set

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/z8IE7zl.png">
    <figcaption>Class hierarchy</figcaption>
</div>

* *Constraints*. Queries asking for all entities of the base entity set must consider all entities of the derived entity sets as well

**Class hierarchy representation**. A class hierarchy can be viewed in one of two ways
* *Specialization*. The base class is specialized into subclasses
    * *Specialization*. The process of identifying subsets of an entity set, i.e. the superclass, which share some distinguishing characteristic
    * *Specialization order*. 
        1. The superclass is defined first
        2. The subclasses are defined next
        3. Subclass-specific attributes and relationship sets are then added
* *Generalization*. Consist of identifying some common characteristics of a collection of entity sets
    
    $\to$ Then creating a new entity set containing entities possessing these common characteristics
    * *Generalization order*. 
        1. The subclasses are defined first
        2. The superclass is defined next
        3. Any relationship sets that involve the superclass are then defined

**Constraints w.r.t ISA hierarchy**.
* *Overlap constraints*. Determine whether two subclasses are allowed to contain the same entity
    * *Notation*. `DerivedClassA OVERLAPS DerivedClassB`
        
        $\to$ In the absence of such a statement, we assume by default that entity sets are constrained to have no overlap
* *Covering constraints*. Determine whether the entities in the subclasses collectively include all entities in the superclass
    * *A characteristic property of generalization hierarchies*. Every instance of a superclass is an instance of a subclass
    * *Notation*. `DerivedClassA AND DerivedClassB COVER BaseClass`

### Aggregation
**Brief**. Currently, a relationship set is an association between entity sets

$\to$ Sometimes we have to model a relationship between a collection of entities and relationships

**Aggregation**. Indicate that a relationship set, i.e. identified through a dashed box, participates in another relationship set
* *Usage*. When we need to express a relationship among relationships

**Example**. 
* *Scenario*. Suppose that we have an entity set `Projects`
    * Each `Projects` entity is sponsored by one or more departments
        
        $\to$ The `Sponsors` relationship set captures this information
    * A department that sponsors a project might assign employees to monitor the sponsorship
        
        $\to$ `Monitors` should be a relationship set that associates a `Sponsors` relationship with an `Employees` entity
* *Problem*. We have defined relationships to associate two or more entities

    $\to$ We need aggregation in this case
