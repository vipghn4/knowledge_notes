# Disk space management
**Disk space manager**. The lowest level of software in the DBMS architecture, which manages space on disk
* *Unit of data*. Abstractly, the disk space manager supports the concept of a page as a unit of data
    * *Page size*. Chosen to be the size of a disk block
    * *Page storage*. Pages are stored as disk blocks so that reading or writing a page can be done in one disk I/O
* *Functionality*. Disk space manager provides commands to allocate or deallocate a page and read or write a page

**Page allocation**. It is often useful to allocate a sequence of pages as a contiguous sequence of blocks to hold data that is frequently accessed in sequential order

$\to$ This is essential for exploiting the advantages of sequentially accessing disk blocks
* *Disk space manager and page allocation*. Such a capability, if desired, must be provided by the disk space manager to higher-level layers of the DBMS
* *Consequences*. 
    * The disk space manager hides details of the underlying hardware, and possibly the operating system
    * The disk space manager allows higher levels of the software to think of the data as a collection of pages

## Keeping track of free blocks
**Brief**. A database grows and shrinks as records are inserted and deleted over time

$\to$ The disk space manager keeps track of which disk blocks are in use, in addition to keeping track of which pages are on which disk blocks
* *Problem*. Although it is likely that blocks are initially allocated sequentially on disk
    
    $\to$ Subsequent allocations and deallocations could in general create "holes"

**Keeping track of block usage**.
* *Option 1*. Maintain a list of free blocks
    * *Block deallocation*. As blocks are deallocated by the higher-level software requesting and using these blocks

        $\to$ We can add them to the free list for future use
    * *Free block pointer*. A pointer to the first block on the free block list is stored in a known location on disk
* *Option 2*. Maintain a bitmap with one bit for each disk block indicating whether a block is in use or not
    * *Benefits*. A bitmap allows very fast identification and allocation of contiguous areas on disk
    
        $\to$ Whereas this is difficult to accomplish with a linked list approach

## Using OS file systems to manage disk space
**Brief**. Operating systems also manage space on disk
* *Support for file abstraction*. An OS supports the abstraction of a file as a sequence of bytes
* *I/O operations*. The OS manages space on the disk and translates requests like 
    
    $$\text{Read byte } i \text{ of file } f$$
    
    into corresponding low-level instructions
    
    $$\text{Read block } m \text{ of track } t \text{ of cylinder } c \text{ of disk } d$$
    
* *Building database disk space manager using OS files*. The entire database could reside in one or more OS files, for which a number of blocks are allocated by the OS, and initialized
    
    $\to$ The disk space manager is then responsible for managing the space in these OS files

**Common practice**. Many database systems do not rely on the OS file system and instead do their own disk management, either from scratch or by extending OS facilities
* *Practical reason*. A DBMS vendor wishing to support several OS platforms cannot assume features specific to any OS, for portability
    
    $\to$ The vendor then try to make the DBMS code as self-contained as possible
* *Technical reason*. 
    * On a 32-bit system, the largest file size is 4 GB, whereas a DBMS may want to access a single file larger than that
    * Typical OS files cannot span disk devices, which is often desirable or even necessary in a DBMS
