# The memory hierarchy
**Brief**. This chapter initiates a study of the internals of an RDBMS, i.e. 
* The disk space manager
* The buffer manager
* The layer supporting the abstraction of a file of records

**Disk space manager and file manager**. Data in a DBMS is stored on storage devices such as disks and tapes
* *Disk space manager*. Keep track of available disk space
* *File manager*. Provide the abstraction of a file of records to higher levels of DBMS code
* *Interaction between file manager and disk manager*. The file manager issues requests to the disk space manager to obtain and relinquish space on disk

**Page**. The file management layer requests and frees disk space in units of a page

$\to$ The file management layer is responsible for keeping track of the pages in a file and for arranging records within pages
* *Page size*. A DBMS parameter, and typical values are 4 KB or 8 KB

**Data fetching**. When a record is needed for processing, it must be fetched from disk to main memory
1. The page on which the record resides is determined by the file manager
    
    >**NOTE**. Sometimes, the file manager uses auxiliary data structures to quickly identify the desired page

2. After identifying the required page, the file manager issues a request for the page to a layer of DBMS code, i.e. the buffer manager
3. The buffer manager fetches a requested page from disk into a main memory region, i.e. the buffer pool
4. The buffer manager tells the file manager the location of the requested page

## The memory hierarchy
**Computer system memory hierarchy**. Arranged in a hierarchy

<div style="text-align:center">

    <figcaption>The memory hierarchy</figcaption>
</div>

* *Primary storage*. Consist of cache and main memory, and provide very fast access to data
* *Secondary storage*. Consist of slower devices, e.g. magnetic disks
* *Tertiary storage*. The slowest class of storage devices, e.g. optical disks and tapes

**Reasons for storing data on secondary and tertiary storage**.
* *Needs for large and cheap storage*. The cost of a given amount of main memory is currently much larger than the cost of the same amount of disk space, and tapes are even less expensive than disks
    
    $\to$ Slower storage devices such as tapes and disks play an important role in database systems, i.e.  
    * The amount of data is typically very large
    * Since buying enough main memory to store all data is prohibitively expensive
    
        $\to$ We must store data on tapes and disks and build database systems, which can retrieve data from lower levels of the memory hierarchy into main memory, as needed for processing
* *Needs for nonvolatile storage*. On systems with 32-bit addressing, only $2^{32}$ bytes can be directly referenced in main memory
    * *Problems*.
        * The number of data objects may exceed this number
        * Data must be maintained across program executions
    * *Consequence*. Storage devices must retain information when the computer is restarted
    * *Volatility of storage types*. 
        * Primary storage is usually volatile
            
            >**NOTE**. We can make it nonvolatile by adding a battery backup feature
        
        * Secondary and tertiary storage is nonvolatile

**Tapes as archival storage**. Tapes are relatively inexpensive and can store very large amounts of data

$\to$ They are a good choice for archival storage
* *Archival storage*. Used to maintain data for a long period without regular access
* *Drawback of tapes*. Tapes are sequential access devices
    
    $\to$ Data must be accessed in order and cannot be directly accessed a given location on tape
    * *Consequence*. 
        * Tapes are unsuitable for storing operational data, or frequently accessed data
        * Tapes are mostly used to back up operational data periodically

## Magnetic disks
**Magnetic disks**. Support direct access to a desired location and are widely used for
database applications
* *Disk data access*. A DBMS provides seamless access to data on disk

    $\to$ Applications need not worry about whether data is in main memory or disk

**Simplified structure of a disk**.

    <figcaption>Structure of a disk</figcaption>
</div>

* *Disk blocks*. Data is stored on disk in units called disk blocks
    * *Disk block structure*. A disk block is a contiguous sequence of bytes
    
        $\to$ This is the unit in which data is written to a disk and read from a disk
* *Tracks and platters*. Blocks are arranged in concentric rings called tracks, on one or more platters
    * *Track record on platter surfaces*. Tracks can be recorded on one or both surfaces of a platter
    
        $\to$ We refer to platters as single-sided or double-sided accordingly
* *Cylinder*. The set of all tracks with the same diameter, i.e. the space occupied by these tracks is shaped like a cylinder
    * *Cylinder structure*. A cylinder contains one track per platter surface
* *Sectors*. Each track is divided into arcs called sectors, whose size is a characteristic of the disk and cannot be changed
    * *Sector size and disk block size*. The size of a disk block can be set when the disk is initialized as a multiple of the sector size
* *Disk heads*. An array of disk heads, one per recorded surface, is moved as a unit
    * *Disk head movement*. When one head is positioned over a block, the other heads are in identical positions w.r.t their platters
    * *Read-write operations*. To read or write a block, a disk head must be positioned on top of the block
        * *Consequence*. As the size of a platter decreases, seek times also decrease since we have to move a disk head a smaller distance
    * *Concurrent head operations*. Current systems typically allow at most one disk head to read or write at any one time

        $\to$ All the disk heads cannot read or write in parallel
        * *Pros of concurrent operations*.
            * Increase data transfer rates by a factor equal to the number of disk heads
            * Considerably speed up sequential scans
        * *Reasons for not supporting concurrent operations*. It is very difficult to ensure that all the heads are perfectly aligned on the corresponding tracks
            * *Explain*. Current approaches are both expensive and more prone to faults as compared to disks with a single active head
            * *Consequence*. In practice very few commercial products support this capability, and only in a limited way
* *Disk controller*. Interface a disk drive to the computer
    * *Command implementation*. The controller implements commands to read or write a sector
        1. Move the arm assembly and transfer data to and from the disk surfaces
        2. A checksum is computed for when data is written to a sector and stored with the sector
        3. The checksum is computed again when the data on the sector is read back
            * *Requirements on checksum*. If the sector is corrupted or the read is faulty for some reason
                
                $\to$ It is very unlikely that the checksum computed when the sector is read matches the checksum computed when the sector was written
        4. If an error is detected, try to read the sector again
        5. If the sector is corrupted and read fails repeatedly, signal a failure

**Magnetic disk performance metrics**. While direct access to any desired location in main memory takes approximately the same time

$\to$ Determining the time to access a location on disk is more complicated
* *Explain*. The time to access a disk block has several components
    * *Seek time*. The time taken to move the disk heads to the track, on which a desired block is located
    * *Rotational delay*. The waiting time for the desired block to rotate under the disk head
        
        >**NOTE**. This is the time required for half a rotation on average and is usually less than seek time

    * *Transfer time*. The time to actually read or write the data in the block once the head is positioned
        * *Explain*. The time for the disk to rotate over the block

## Performance implications of disk structure
**Key notes**.
* Data must be in memory for the DBMS to operate on it
* The unit for data transfer between disk and main memory is a block
    * *Consequence*. If a single item on a block is needed, the entire block is transferred
    * *I/O operation*. Reading or writing a disk block
* The time to read or write a block varies, depending on the location of the data

    $$\text{access time} = \text{seek time} + \text{rotational delay} + \text{transfer time}$$

**Decisive factors of database operations' performance**. The time taken for database operations is affected significantly by how data is stored on disks
* *Dominant performance bottleneck*. The time for moving blocks to or from disk
    
    $\to$ To minimize this time, it is necessary to locate data records strategically on disk
    * *Explain*. Due to the geometry and mechanics of disks
* *Basic idea*. If two records are frequently used together, we should place them close together
    * *Closeness of two records' placement*. The ‘closest’ that two records can be on a disk is to be on the same block
    
        $\to$ In decreasing order of closeness, they could be on the same track, the same cylinder, or an adjacent cylinder
        * *Explain*. 
            * Two records on the same block  are read or written as part of the block
                
                $\to$ They are obviously as close together as possible
            * As the platter spins, other blocks on the track being read or written rotate under the active head

**One-revolution disk design**. In current disk designs, all the data on a track can be read or written in one revolution
* *Idea*. 
    1. After a track is read or written, another disk head becomes active, and another track in the same cylinder is read or written
    2. The process continues until all tracks in the current cylinder are read or written
    3. The arm assembly moves in or out to an adjacent cylinder
* *Consequence*. We have a natural notion of ‘closeness’ for blocks, which we can extend to a notion of next and previous blocks
* *Usage*. Exploiting this notion of next by arranging records so that they are read or written sequentially is very important for reducing the time spent in disk I/Os
    * *Explain*. Sequential access minimizes seek time and rotational delay and is much faster than random access
