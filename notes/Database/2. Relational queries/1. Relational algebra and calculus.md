# Relational algebra and calculus
**Query languages**. Specialized languages for asking questions, or queries, involving data in a database

**Formal query languages for relational models**.
* *Relational algebra*. Queries are composed using a collection of operators
    
    $\to$ Each query describes a step-by-step procedure for computing the desired answer
    * *Consequence*. Queries are specified in an operational manner
* *Relational calculus*. A query describes the desired answer, without specifying how the answer is to be computed
    
    $\to$ This nonprocedural style of querying is called declarative

>**NOTE**. These formal query languages have greatly influenced commercial query languages, e.g. SQL

## Preliminaries
**Relational queries**. 
* *Query inputs and outputs*. Relations
* *Query evaluation*. A query is evaluated using instances of each input relation, and it produces an instance of the output relation

**Field indexing**.
* *Approaches*.
    * *Option 1*. Field names to refer to fields, i.e. to make queries more readable
    * *Option 2*. List the fields of a given relation in the same order
        
        $\to$ We refer to fields by position rather than by field name        
* *Field indexing in relation algebra and calculus*, The second option this is more convenient than referring to fields by name
    * *Explain*. Queries often involve the computation of intermediate results, which are themselves relation instances
       * *Consequence*. If we use field names to refer to fields
               
            $\to$ The definition of query language constructs must specify the names of fields for all intermediate relation instances
    * *Convention*. Intermediate relations are allowed to inherit field names, for convenience

## Relational algebra
**Relational algebra**. Queries in algebra are composed using a collection of operators
* *Relational algebra operators*. Every operator in the algebra accepts one or two relation instances as arguments and returns a relation instance as the result
    
    $\to$ It is easy compose operators to form a complex query
* *Relational algebra expression*. Recursively defined to be a relation, a unary algebra operator applied to a single expression, or a binary algebra operator applied to two expressions
* *Operators of relational algebra*.
    * *Basic operators*. Selection, projection, union, cross-product, and difference
    * *Additional operators*. Defined in terms of basic operators, but arise frequently enough to warrant special attention

### Selection and projection
**Selection ($\sigma$) and projection ($\pi$)**. Allow us to manipulate data in a single relation
* *Selection*. Used to retrieve rows, e.g. rows corresponding to expert sailors are retrieved from relation $\text{S2}$ by

    $$\sigma_{\text{rating}\geq s}(\text{S2})$$

    * *Selection condition*. $\sigma$ specifies the tuples to retain through a selection condition
        * *Selection condition*. A boolean combination of terms having the form 
            
            $$\text{attribute op constant}$$ 
            
            or

            $$\text{attribute\_1 op attribute\_2}$$
            
            where $\text{op} \in \{<, \leq, =, \neq, \geq, >\}$
    * *Reference to an attribute*. 
        * *Option 1*. By position of the form $:i$ or $i$
        * *Option 2*. By name of the form $.name$ or $name$
    * *Output schema*. The schema of the input relation instance
* *Projection*. Used to retrieve columns, e.g. `sname` and `rating` are retrieved from relation $\text{S2}$ by

    $$\pi_{\text{sname},\text{rating}}(\text{S2})$$

    $\to$ Other fields are said to be projected out
    * *Output schema*. Determined by the fields, which are projected in the obvious way

**Duplicate elimination**. Due to the definition of a relation as a set of tuples

$\to$ Duplicate tuples in the resulting instance will be removed

### Set operations
**Union**. $R\cup S$ returns a relation instance containing all tuples in either $R$ or $S$ or both
* *Union-compatible relation instances*. 
    * *Conditions for union-compatibility*. Two relation instances are union-compatible if
        * They have the same number of the fields
        * They have the same of corresponding fields, taken in order from left to right
        * The corresponding fields have the same domains
    
    >**NOTE**. Field names are not used in defining union-compatibility
* *Requirement*. $R$ and $S$ must be unioncompatible
* *Output schema*. Defined to be identical to the schema of $R$
    * *Explain*. For convenience, the fields of $R \cup S$ are assumed to inherit names from $R$, if the fields
of R have names

**Intersection**. $R\cap S$ returns a relation instance containing all tuples that occur in both $R$ and $S$
* *Requirements*. $R$ and $S$ must be union-compatible
* *Output schema*. Defined to be identical to the schema of $R$

**Set-difference**. $Râˆ’S$ returns a relation instance containing all tuples that occur in $R$ but not in $S$
* *Requirements*. $R$ and $S$ must be union-compatible
* *Output schema*. Defined to be identical to the schema of $R$

**Cross-product (or Cartesian product)**. $R \times S$ returns a relation instance whose schema contains all the fields of $R$, in the same order as they appear in $R$, followed by all the fields of $S$, in the same order as they appear in $S$
* *Output schema*. For each pair of tuples $r \in R, s \in S$
    
    $\to$ The output schema contains one tuple $\langle r, s\rangle$, i.e. the concatenation of tuples r and s
* *Field names*. The fields of $R \times S$ inherit names from the corresponding fields of $R$ and $S$
    * *Naming conflicts*. When both $R$ and $S$ contain one or more fields having the same name
        * *Solution*. The corresponding fields in $R \times S$ are unnamed and are referred to solely by position

### Renaming
**Field name conventions**. Need to be carefully adopted to ensure that the result of a relational algebra expression inherits field names from its input relation instances in a natural way whenever possible
* *Name conflicts*. Can arise in some cases, e.g. in $S \times R$
    
    $\to$ We should able to give field names explicitly to the output relation instance of a relational algebra expression
* *Relation instance name*. It is often convenient to give the instance itself a name
    
    $\to$ We can break a large algebra expression into pieces, by giving names to subexpressions' results
* *Consequence*. A renaming operator $\rho$ is introduced

**Renaming operator**. $\rho(R(F), E)$ takes a relational algebra expression $E$ and returns an instance of a new relation called $R$, which is defined as
* $R$ contains the same tuples as the result of $E$
* $R$ has the same schema as $E$
* The field names in $R$ are the same as in E, except for fields renamed in $\bar{F}$
    * *Renaming list $\bar{F}$*. A list of terms having the form 
        
        $$\text{oldname} \to \text{newname}$$
        
        or 
        
        $$\text{position} \to \text{newname}$$
    
**Field reference**. For $\rho$ to be well-defined
* References to fields, i.e. $\text{oldnames}$ or $\text{positions}$, must be unambiguous
* No two fields in the result must have the same name

**Optionality of arguments**. Sometimes we only want to rename fields or to (re)name the relation

$\to$ Either $R$ and $F$ are optional in $\rho$, but not both

**Other additional operators in the algebra**. Can all be defined in terms of the operators that we have defined thus far

### Joins
**Join operation**. One of the most useful operations in relational algebra
* *Join in terms of basic operators*. A cross-product followed by selections and projections
* *Needs for separate definition of join*. Joins have received a lot of attention, and there are several variants of the join operation, i.e.
    * Joins arise much more frequently in practice than plain cross-products
    * The result of a cross-product is typically much larger than the result of a join
    * It is very important to recognize joins and implement them without materializing the underlying cross-product
        * *Explain*. By applying the selections and projections on-the-fly
* *Usage*. Most commonly used to combine information from two or more relations

#### Condition joins
**Condition joins**. The most general version of the join operation
* *Condition joins*. Accept a join condition $c$ and a pair of relation instances as arguments, and returns a relation instance
    * *Join condition*. Identical to a selection condition in form
    * *Field reference*. The condition can, and typically does, refer to attributes of both input relations
        * *Option 1*. By position, i.e. of the form $R.i$
        * *Option 2*. By name, i.e. of the
form $R.\text{name}$
* *Notation*. $\bowtie$ is defined to be a cross-product followed by a selection, i.e.

    $$R \bowtie_c S = \sigma_c (R\times S)$$

#### Equijoin
**Motivation**. A common special case of the join operation $R \bowtie S$, i.e. when the join condition consists solely of equalities between two fields in $R$ and $S$, connected by $\land$

$\to$ There is some redundancy in retaining both attributes in the result
* *Consequence*. The join is refined by doing an additional projection, equal fields of $S$ are dropped

    $\to$ The join operation with this refinement is called equijoin

**Equijoin**.
* *Output schema*. Contain 
    * The fields of $R$, with the same names and domains as in $R$, followed by
    * The fields of $S$, which are not in the join conditions
* *Name conflict*. If this set of fields in the result relation includes two fields inheriting the
same name from $R$ and $S$

    $\to$ They are unnamed in the result relation

#### Natural join
**Motivation**. A further special case of the join operation $R \bowtie S$ is an equijoin, in which equalities are specified on all fields with the same name in $R$ and $S$

$\to$ We can simply omit the join condition
* *Default case*. The join condition is a collection of equalities on all common fields
    
    $\to$ We call this a natural join'

**Natural join**.
* *Desired property*. The result is guaranteed not to have two fields with the same name
* *Notation*. $R\bowtie S$

### Division
**Motivation**. Division is Useful for expressing certain kinds of queries, e.g. find the names of sailors who have reserved all boats
    
>**NOTE**. Understanding how to use the basic operators of the algebra to define division is a useful

* *Needs for division*. This operator does not have the same importance as the other operators

    $\to$ It is not needed as often
    * *Consequences*. Database systems do not try to exploit the semantics of division by implementing it as a distinct operator

**Division**. 
* *Assumptions*. 
    * $A$ and $B$ are two relation instances
    * $A$ has exactly two fields $x$ and $y$
    * $B$ has just one field y, with the same domain as in $A$
* *Division operation $A/B$*. The set of all $x$ values, in the form of unary tuples

    $$\forall y\in B,\exists \langle x,y\rangle\in A$$

* *Analogy*.
    * *Interger division*. $A/B$ results in the largest integer $Q$ so that

        $$Q\cdot B\leq A$$
    
    * *Set division*. $A/B$ results in the largest set $Q$ so that

        $$Q\times B\subseteq A$$

* *Division in terms of basic operators*.

    $$A/B = \pi_x(A) - \pi_x[(\pi_x(A)\times B) - A]$$

* *Generalization*. When $x$ and $y$ are sets of attributes, rather than single attributes

## Relational calculus
**Relational calculus**. An alternative to relational algebra
* *Difference from algebra*. Algebra is procedural, while calculus is nonprocedural, or declarative
    * *Explain*. Relation calculus allows us to describe the set of answers, without being explicit about how they should be computed
* *Usage*. Relational calculus has had a big influence on the design of commercial
query languages, e.g. SQL and Query-by-Example (QBE)

**Types of relational calculus**.
* *Tuple relational calculus (TRC)*. Variables take on tuples as values
    
    $\to$ This is the variant of the calculus that we present here
    * *Usage*. TRC has had more of an influence on SQL
* *Domain relational calculus (DRC)*. Variables range over field values
    * *Usage*. while DRC has strongly influenced QBE

### Tuple relational calculus
**Fundamental concepts**.
* *Tuple variable*. A variable taking on tuples of a particular relation schema as values

    $\to$ Every value assigned to a given tuple variable has the same number and type of fields
* *TRC query*. Have the form $\{ T : p(T)\}$, where $T$ is a tuple variable and $p(T)$ is a formula describing $T$
    * *Query output*. $\{t:p(t)=\text{true}\}$
* *Language for writing $p(T)$*. At the heart of TRC, and essentially a simple subset of first-order logic

#### Syntax of TRC queries
**Formula**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $\text{Rel}$ is a relation name
    * $R$ and $S$ are tuple variables
    * $a$ is an attribute of $R$, and $b$ is an attribute of $S$
    * $\text{op}\in\{<,>,=,\leq,\geq,\neq\}$ is an operator in the set
    * $p$ and $q$ are formulas, where $p(R)$ denotes a formula in which the $R$ appears 
* *Atomic formula*. One of the following:
    * $R \in Rel$
    * $R.a \text{ op } S.b$
    * $R.a \text{ op } \text{constant}$, or $\text{constant} \text{ op } R.a$
* *Formula*. A combination of atomic formulas 
    
    $\to$ A formula is recursively defined to be one of the following
    * Any atomic formula
    * $\lnot p, p \land q, p \lor q, p \implies q$
    * $\exists R(p(R))$, where $R$ is a tuple variable
    * $\forall R(p(R))$, where $R$ is a tuple variable
* *Variable binding*.
    * *Binded variables*. The quantifiers $\exists$ and $\forall$ are said to bind $R$
    * *Free variables*. If the (sub)formula does not contain an occurrence of a quantifier that binding it
        
        $\to$ A variable is said to be free in a formula or subformula

**Variable domain in TRC formula**. Each variable has a well-defined type, in the programming language sense
* *Explain*.
    * Every variable in a TRC formula appears in a atomic subformula
    * Every relation schema specifies a domain for each field

**TRC query**. Expression of the form 

$$\{T : p(T)\}$$

where $T$ is the only free variable in the formula $p$

### Domain relational calculus
**Fundamental concepts**.
* *Domain variable*. A variable ranging over the values in the domain of some attribute
    * *Example*. The variable can be assigned an integer if it appears in an integer attribute
* *DRC query*. Have the form 
    
    $$\{\langle x_1, \dots, x_n\rangle : p(\langle x1, \dots, x_n\rangle)\}$$
    
    where each $x_i$ is either a domain variable or a constant
    * *DRC formula*. $p(\langle x1, \dots, x_n\rangle)$, where only free variables are the variables among $x_1,\dots,x_n$
    * *Query output*. 
        
        $$\{\langle x1, \dots, x_n\rangle:p(\langle x1, \dots, x_n\rangle) = \text{true}\}$$

**Formula**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $\text{op}\in\{<,>,=,\leq,\geq,\neq\}$ is an operator
    * $X$ and $Y$ are domain variables
    * $\text{Rel}$ is a relation with $n$ attributes
    * Each $x_i$ is either a variable or a constant
    * $p$ and $q$ are formulas, where $p(X)$ denotes a formula in which $X$ appears
* *DRC formula*. Defined in a similar manner as TRC
formulas
    * *Difference from TRC formulas*. The variables are domain variables, not tuple variables
* *Atomic formula*. An atomic formula in DRC is one of the following:
    * $\langle x_1, \dots, x_n\rangle \in \text{Rel}$
    * $X \text{ op } Y$
    * $X \text{ op } \text{constant}$, or $\text{constant} \text{ op } X$
* *Formula*. Recursively defined to be one of the following
    * Any atomic formula
    * $\lnot p, p \land q, p \lor q, p \implies q$
    * $\exists X(p(X))$, where $X is a domain variable
    * $\forall X(p(X))$, where $X is a domain variable

## Expressive power of algebra and calculus
**A major problem with the calculus**. Consider the query $\{S : \lnot(S \in \text{Sailors})$
* *Problem*. This query is syntactically correct, however, it asks for an infinite set
    
    $\to$ This simple example illustrates an unsafe query
* *Consequence*. We must restrict relational calculus to disallow unsafe queries

**Safe queries in relational calculus**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $I$ is a set of relation instances, with one instance per relation appearing in the query $Q$
    * $\text{Dom}(Q, I)$ is the set of all constants in these relation instances in $Q$, or in the formulation of $Q$
* *Finite domain*. Since we only allow finite instances $I$
    
    $\to$ $\text{Dom}(Q, I)$ is also finite
* *Observations*. 
    * For $Q$ to be safe, we need that
        * For any given $I$, the set of answers for $Q$ contains only values in $\text{Dom}(Q, I)$
        * The set of answers can be computed by only examining tuples containing constants in $\text{Dom}(Q, I)$
    * This leads to a subtle point associated with the use of quantifiers $\forall$ and $\exists$, i.e. 
        * Given a TRC formula $\exists R(p(R))$, we want to compute the output by checking only tuples that contain constants in $\text{Dom}(Q, I)$
        * Given a TRC formula $\forall R(p(R))$, we want to compute the output by checking only tuples that contain constants in $\text{Dom}(Q, I)$
* *Safe TRC formula*. A formula $Q$ is safe if
    * For any given $I$, the set of answers for $Q$ contains only values in $\text{Dom}(Q, I)$
    * For each subexpression $\exists R(p(R))$ in $Q$, if a tuple $r$ makes the formula true
        
        $\to$ $r$ contains only constants in $\text{Dom}(Q, I)$
    * For each subexpression $\forall R(p(R))$ in $Q$, if a tuple $r$ contains a constant not in $\text{Dom}(Q, I)$
        
        $\to$ $r$ must make the formula true

    >**NOTE**. This definition is not constructive, i.e. it does not tell us how to check if a query is safe

**Comparison between relational algebra and relational calculus**. We have several questions
* Are they equivalent in power?
    * *Performance metric*. The expressive power of relational algebra
    * *Relationally complete language*. Any query language, which can express all the queries that we can express in relational algebra
* Can every query that can be expressed in relational algebra also be expressed in relational calculus? 
    
    $\to$ The answer is yes, it can
* Can every query that can be expressed in relational calculus also be expressed in relational algebra? 
    
    $\to$ This is true for any query, which can be expressed using a safe relational calculus query

**Practical query languages**. Expected to be relationally complete

>**NOTE**. Commercial query languages typically support features to express some queries, which cannot be expressed in relational algebra
