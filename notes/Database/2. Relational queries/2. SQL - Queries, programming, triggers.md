# SQL - Queries, programming, triggers
**Structured Query Language (SQL)**. The most widely used commercial relational database language
* *History*. 
    * SQL was originally developed at IBM in the SEQUEL-XRM and System-R projects, from 1974 to 1977
    * Almost immediately, other vendors introduced DBMS products based on SQL
        
        $\to$ SQL is now a de facto standard
    * SQL continues to evolve in response to changing needs in the database area
* *SQL 92*. The ANSI/ISO standard for SQL

**Key aspects**.
* *Data Definition Language (DDL)*. This subset of SQL supports the creation, deletion, and modification of definitions for tables and views
    * *Integrity constraints*. Can be defined on tables, either when the table is created or later
    * *Protection*. The DDL also provides commands for specifying access rights or privileges to tables and views
    * *Indexing*. Although the standard does not discuss indexes
        
        $\to$ commercial implementations also provide commands for creating and deleting indexes
* *Data Manipulation Language (DML)*. This subset of SQL allows users to pose queries and to insert, delete, and modify rows
* *Embedded and dynamic SQL*. 
    * *Embedded SQL features*. Allow SQL code to be called from a host language, e.g. C or COBOL
    * *Dynamic SQL features*. Allow a query to be constructed, and executed, at run-time
* *Triggers*. Actions executed by the DBMS whenever changes to the database meet conditions specified in the trigger
* *Security*. SQL provides mechanisms to control users’ access to data objects, e.g. tables and views
* *Transaction management*. Various commands allow a user to explicitly control aspects of how a transaction is to be executed
* *Client-server execution and remote database access*. These commands control how a client application program can connect to an SQL database server, or access data from a database over a network

>**NOTE**. The ease of expressing queries in SQL has played a major role in the success of relational
database systems

**Active database**. Have a collection of triggers, which are specified by the DBA
* *Trigger*. Describe actions to be taken when certain situations arise
    
    $\to$ The DBMS monitors the database, detects these situations, and invokes the trigger

**Underlying example**. This section will present queries using the following table definitions

```sql
Sailors(sid: integer, sname: string, rating: integer, age: real)
Boats(bid: integer, bname: string, color: string)
Reserves(sid: integer, bid: integer, day: date)
```

## The form of a basic SQL example
**Brief**. This section presents the syntax of a simple SQL query and explains its meaning
through a conceptual evaluation strategy
* *Conceptual evaluation strategy*. A way to evaluate the query, which is intended to be easy to understand, rather than efficient

    $\to$ The DBMS would typically execute a query in a different and more efficient way

**Basic form of SQL query**. The following query intuitively corresponds to a relational algebra expression involving selections, projections, and cross-products

```sql
SELECT [ DISTINCT ] select-list -- specify columns to be retained in the result
FROM from-list -- specify a cross-product of tables
WHERE qualification -- specify selection conditions on table mentioned in FROM
```

* *Example*.

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT S.sname, S.age
    FROM Sailors AS S
    WHERE S.rating > 7
    ```

* *`SELECT` and `WHERE`*. The `SELECT` clause is actually used to do projection, whereas selections in the relational algebra sense are expressed using the `WHERE` clause
    
    >**NOTE**. This mismatch between the naming of the selection and projection operators in relational algebra and the syntax of SQL is an unfortunate historical accident

* *Arguments to the query*.
    * *`from-list` in the `FROM` clause*. A list of table names
        * *Range variable*. A table name can be followed by a range variable
            
            $\to$ The range variable is particularly useful when the same table name appears more than once in the from-list
    * *`select-list`*. A list of expressions involving column names of tables named in the `from-list`
        * *Range variable*. Column names can be prefixed by a range variable
    * *`qualification` in the `WHERE` clause*. A boolean combination, i.e. an expression using `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, of conditions of the form

        $$\text{expression op expression}$$
        
        where $\text{op}\in\{<,\leq,=,<>,\geq,>\}$
        * *Expression*. A column name, a constant, or an arithmetic (or string) expression
* *Query output*. A multiset, or set, of rows, each of which is a tuple of desired tuple attributes

**Conceptual evaluation strategy for basic SQL query**.
1. Compute the cross-product of the tables in the `from-list`
2. Delete those rows in the cross-product that fail the qualification conditions
3. Delete all columns that do not appear in the `select-list`
4. If `DISTINCT` is specified, eliminate duplicate rows

**Keywords**.
* *`DISTINCT`*. Without the keyword `DISTINCT`, we would get a copy of the desired tuples, and the answer would be a multiset of rows
    * *Multiset*. An unordered collection of elements, and there could be several copies of each element, and the number of copies is significant
* *`AS`*. Used to introduce a range variable

### Expressions and strings in the `SELECT` command
**Expressions**. SQL supports a more general version of the `select-list` than just a list of columns

$\to$ Each item in a `select-list` can be of the form 

```sql
expression AS column_name
```

* *Expression `expression`*. Can be one of the forms
    * Any arithmetic or string expression over column names, possibly prefixed by range
variables, and constants
    * Aggregates, e.g. sum and count
    * Expressions over date and time values
    * Other built-in functions, e.g. `sqrt`, `sin`, and `mod`
* *Examples*.

    ```sql
    SELECT S.sname, S.rating+1 AS rating
    FROM Sailors S, Reserves R1, Reserves R2
    WHERE S.sid = R1.sid AND S.sid = R2.sid
    AND R1.day = R2.day AND R1.bid <> R2.bid
    ```

    or

    ```sql
    SELECT S1.sname AS name1, S2.sname AS name2
    FROM Sailors S1, Sailors S2
    WHERE 2*S1.rating = S2.rating-1
    ```

**Strings**.
* *String comparisons*. We can use comparison operators `=`, `<`, `>`, etc.
* *String sorting*. If we need to sort strings by an order other than alphabetical
    
    $\to$ SQL-92 supports a general concept of a collation, or sort order, for a character set
    * *Collation*. Allow users to specify which characters are less than which others
        
        $\to$ This provides great flexibility in string manipulation
* *Pattern matching*. SQL provides support for pattern matching through the `LIKE` operator and the wild-card symbols
    * *Wild-card symbols*.
        * `%` stands for zero or more arbitrary characters
            * *Example*. `AB%` denotes a pattern that will match every string that contains at least three characters, with the leading characters are `AB`
        * `_` stands for exactly one, arbitrary, character
    * *Blanks and `LIKE`*. Blanks can be significant for the `LIKE` operator, depending on the collation for the underlying character set
        * *Example*. `"Jeff" = "Jeff "` could be true, while `"Jeff" LIKE "Jeff "` is false
    * *Example*.

        ```sql
        SELECT S.age
        FROM Sailors S
        WHERE S.sname LIKE ‘B_%B’
        ```

## `UNION`, `INTERCEPT`, and `EXCEPT`
**Set-manipulation operations**. SQL provides three set-manipulation constructs extending the basic query form presented earlier
* *Motivation*. Since the answer to a query is a multiset of rows
    
    $\to$ It is natural to consider the use of operations such as union, intersection, and difference
* *Set-manipulation operations*. 
    * *Main operations*. SQL supports these operations via `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`
    * *Other operations*. SQL also provides other set operations, i.e. 
        * `IN` to check if an element is in a given set
        * `op ANY`, `op ALL` to compare a value with the elements in a given set, using comparison operator `op`
            * *Examples*. `x = ANY(Salary)` or `x >= ANY(Salary)`
        * `EXISTS` to check if a set is empty, i.e. `EXISTS(table_name)` returns true if the `table_name` contains one or more records
        
        >**NOTE**. `IN` and `EXISTS` can be prefixed by `NOT`, with the obvious modification to their meaning

**Examples**. 
* *Example 1 - Set union*. Consider finding the names of sailors who have reserved a red or a green boat
    * *Query without `UNION`*. This is easily expressed via `OR` in `WHERE` clause

        ```sql
        SELECT S.sname
        FROM Sailors S, Reserves R, Boats B
             WHERE S.sid = R.sid AND R.bid = B.bid
             AND (B.color = ‘red’ OR B.color = ‘green’)
        ```

    * *Query with `UNION`*. Better solution

        ```sql
        SELECT S.sname
        FROM Sailors S, Reserves R, Boats B
        WHERE S.sid = R.sid AND R.bid = B.bid AND B.color = 'red'
        UNION
        SELECT S2.sname
        FROM Sailors S2, Boats B2, Reserves R2
        WHERE S2.sid = R2.sid AND R2.bid = B2.bid AND B2.color = 'green'
        ```

* *Example 2 - Set intersection*. Consider finding the names of sailors who have reserved both a red and a green boat
    * *Query without `INTERSECT`*. Difficult to understand, and inefficient to execute

        ```sql
        SELECT S.sname
        FROM Sailors S, Reserves R1, Boats B1, Reserves R2, Boats B2
        WHERE S.sid = R1.sid AND R1.bid = B1.bid
              AND S.sid = R2.sid AND R2.bid = B2.bid
              AND B1.color='red' AND B2.color = 'green'
        ```

    * *Query with `INTERSECT`*. Better solution

        ```sql
        SELECT S.sname
        FROM Sailors S, Reserves R, Boats B
        WHERE S.sid = R.sid AND R.bid = B.bid AND B.color = 'red'
        INTERSECT
        SELECT S2.sname
        FROM Sailors S2, Boats B2, Reserves R2
        WHERE S2.sid = R2.sid AND R2.bid = B2.bid AND B2.color = 'green'
        ```

        * *Problem*. If there are two sailors having the same name, one of whom reserved a red boat and the other reserved a green one
            
            $\to$ Their name is returned even though none of them has reserved both a red and a green boat
            * *Explain*. The problem arises since we are using `S.name`, which is not a key for `Sailors`, to identify sailors
        * *Solution*. Use `S.sid` instead
* *Example 3 - Set difference*. Consider finding the `sid`s of all sailors, who have reserved red boats but not green boats

    ```sql
    SELECT S.sid
    FROM Sailors S, Reserves R, Boats B
    WHERE S.sid = R.sid AND R.bid = B.bid AND B.color = 'red'
    EXCEPT
    SELECT S2.sid
    FROM Sailors S2, Reserves R2, Boats B2
    WHERE S2.sid = R2.sid AND R2.bid = B2.bid AND B2.color = 'green'
    ```

>**NOTE**. `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` can be used on any two tables, which are union-compatible

**Multiset output relation**. 
* *Multiset output of `UNION`*. In contrast to the default, where duplicates are not eliminated unless `DISTINCT` is specified

    $\to$ The default for `UNION` queries is that duplicates are eliminated
    * *Retain duplicates in `UNION`*. Use `ALL`
* *Multiset output of `INTERSECT`*. One version of INTERSECT retains duplicates
* *Multiset output of `EXCEPT`*. One version of EXCEPT retains duplicates

## Nested queries
**Nested queries**. One of the most powerful features of SQL
* *Nested query*. A query with another query embedded within it
* *Subquery*. The embedded query in a nested query
    * *Subquery in nested query*. A subquery typically appears within the `WHERE` clause of a query, or sometimes in the `FROM` clause or the `HAVING` clause
* *Usage*. When writing a query, we sometimes need to express a condition referring to a table, which must computed
    
    $\to$ The query used to compute this subsidiary table is a subquery and appears as part of the main query

### Introduction to nested queries
**Understanding a nested query**. The best way is to think of nested queries in terms of a conceptual evaluation strategy
* *Conceptual evaluation strategy of nested queries*. 
    1. Construct the cross-product of the tables in the `FROM` clause of the top-level query
    2. For each row in the cross-product, while testing the qualification in the `WHERE` clause, (re)compute the subquery
        
    >**NOTE**. The subquery may contain another nested subquery
    >$\to$ We apply the same idea one more time, leading to an evaluation strategy with several levels of nested loops

* *Example*.

    ```sql
    SELECT S.sname
    FROM Sailors S
    WHERE S.sid IN ( SELECT R.sid
                     FROM Reserves R
                     WHERE R.bid = 103 )
    ```

### Correlated nested queries
**Correlated nested queries**. The subquery could depend on the row being examined in the outer query, in terms of our conceptual evaluation strategy
* *Example*. For each `Sailor` row `S`, we test whether the set of `Reserves` rows `R` such that `R.bid = 103 AND S.sid = R.sid` is nonempty

    ```sql
    SELECT S.sname
    FROM Sailors S
    WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT *
                   FROM Reserves R
                   WHERE R.bid = 103
                         AND R.sid = S.sid )
    ```

* *Correlation*. The occurrence of `S` in the subquery
* *Correlated queries*. Queries, where the subquery depends on the current row being examined

    $\to$ The subquery must be re-evaluated for each row

## Aggregate operators
**Aggregate operators**. We often want to perform some computation or summarization

$\to$ SQL allows the use of arithmetic expressions and aggregate values, e.g. `MIN` and `SUM`
* *Aggregate operations supported by SQL*. Consider any column `A` of a relation
    * `COUNT ([DISTINCT] A)`: The number of (unique) values in the `A` column
    * `SUM ([DISTINCT] A)`: The sum of all (unique) values in the `A` column
    * `AVG ([DISTINCT] A)`: The average of all (unique) values in the `A` column
    * `MAX (A)`: The maximum value in the `A` column
    * `MIN (A)`: The minimum value in the `A` column

    >**NOTE**. It does not make sense to specify `DISTINCT` in conjunction with `MIN` or `MAX`

* *Examples*.
    * *Basic example*.

        ```sql
        SELECT AVG (S.age)
        FROM Sailors S
        WHERE S.rating = 10
        ```

**Argmax operator**. Consider returning not only the maximum age but also the name of the sailors having that age
* *Naive approach*.

    ```sql
    SELECT S.sname, MAX (S.age)
    FROM Sailors S
    ```

    * *Problem*. This query is illegal in SQL, i.e. if the `SELECT` clause uses an aggregate operation
        
        $\to$ It must use only aggregate operations, unless the query contains a `GROUP BY` clause
* *Proper approach*.

    ```sql
    SELECT S.sname, S.age
    FROM Sailors S
    WHERE S.age = ( SELECT MAX (S2.age)
                    FROM Sailors S2 )
    ```

    * *Explain*. The subquery is guaranteed to return a single tuple with a single field
        
        $\to$ SQL converts such a relation to a field value for the sake of the comparison
* *Alternative approach*. This approach is not supported in many systems

    ```sql
    SELECT S.sname, S.age
    FROM Sailors S
    WHERE ( SELECT MAX (S2.age)
            FROM Sailors S2 ) = S.age
    ```

**Aggregate operations and `ANY` and `ALL`**. Aggregate operations offer an alternative to the ANY and ALL constructs
* *Example*. Consider finding the names of sailors who are older than the oldest sailor with a rating of 10
    * *With aggregation*.

        ```sql
        SELECT S.sname
        FROM Sailors S
        WHERE S.age > ( SELECT MAX ( S2.age )
                        FROM Sailors S2
                        WHERE S2.rating = 10 )
        ```
    
    * *Without aggregation*.

        ```sql
        SELECT S.sname
        FROM Sailors S
        WHERE S.age > ALL ( SELECT S2.age
                            FROM Sailors S2
                            WHERE S2.rating = 10 )
        ```
        
        * *Drawback*. This is more error prone, i.e. one could easily and incorrectly use `ANY` instead of `ALL`

### The `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses
**`GROUP BY` clauses**. Often we want to apply aggregate operations to each of a number of groups of rows in a relation, where the number of groups depends on the relation instance
* *`HAVING` clause*. An optional clause included within `GROUP BY` clause, which can be used to specify qualifications over groups
    * *Example*. We may only be interested in rating levels of at least 6
* *`GROUP BY` clause*.

    ```sql
    SELECT [ DISTINCT ] select-list
    FROM from-list
    WHERE qualification
    GROUP BY grouping-list
    HAVING group-qualification
    ```


    * *`select-list` in the `SELECT` clause*. 
        * *Structure*. Consist of
            * A list of column names
            * A list of terms having the form 
                
                $$\text{aggop  ( column-name ) AS new-name}$$

                where `AS new-name` gives the column a name in the resulting table
        * *Aggregation operator*. Any of the aggregation operators can be used for $\text{aggop}$
    * *`grouping-list`*. Every column that appears in the column name list must appear in `grouping-list`
        * *Explain*. Each row in the resulting table corresponds to one group, which is a collection of rows agreeing on the values of columns in `grouping-list`
            * *Consequence*. If a column appears in the column name list, but not in `grouping-list`
                
                $\to$ It is not clear what value should be assigned to it in an answer row
    * *`group-qualification`*. The expressions appearing in `group-qualification` in `HAVING` clause must have a single value per group
        * *Explain*. `HAVING` clause determines whether an answer row is to be generated for a given group
            
            $\to$ A column appearing in `group-qualification` must appear as the argument to an aggregation operator, or it must also appear in `grouping-list`
* *Example*. Consider finding the age of the youngest sailor for each rating level
    * *Without `GROUP BY`*.

        ```sql
        SELECT MIN (S.age)
        FROM Sailors S
        WHERE S.rating = i
        ```

        where $i\in\{1,\dots,10\}$
        * *Drawback*. 
            * Writing 10 such queries is tedious
            * We may not know what rating levels exist in advance.
    * *With `GROUP BY`*

        ```sql
        SELECT S.rating, MIN (S.age)
        FROM Sailors S
        GROUP BY S.rating
        ```

**Examples**.

```sql
SELECT S.rating, MIN (S.age) AS minage
FROM Sailors S
WHERE S.age >= 18
GROUP BY S.rating
HAVING COUNT (*) > 1
```

or

```sql
SELECT B.bid, COUNT (*) AS sailorcount
FROM Boats B, Reserves R
WHERE R.bid = B.bid
GROUP BY B.bid
HAVING B.color = ‘red’
```

**Conceptual evaluation strategy**.
1. Construct the cross-product of tables in the `from-list`
2. Apply the qualification in the `WHERE` clause, e.g. `S.age >= 18`
3. Eliminate unwanted columns, i.e. only columns mentioned in the `SELECT` clause, the `GROUP BY` clause, or the `HAVING` clause are necessary
4. Sort the table according to the `GROUP BY` clause to identify the groups
5. Apply the `group-qualification` in the `HAVING` clause to eliminate invalid groups

    >**NOTE**. The order, in which the `WHERE` and `GROUP BY` clauses are considered is significant

6. Generate one answer row for each remaining group
    * *Answer row corresponding to a group*. Consist of 
        * A subset of the grouping columns
        * One or more columns generated by applying an aggregation operator
7.  If the query contains `DISTINCT` in the `SELECT` clause, duplicates are eliminated

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Levels of SQL-92**. 
* *Problem*. When the standard is updated, DMBS vendors are usually not able to immediately conform to the new standard in their next product releases
    * *Explain*. They have to address issues, e.g. performance improvements and better system management
    * *Consequence*. Three SQL-92 levels have been defined, i.e. Entry SQL, Intermediate SQL, and Full SQL. Of these
* *Levels of SQL-92*.
    * *Entry SQL*. Closest to the previous standard, i.e. SQL-89
        
        $\to$ This is the easiest for a vendor to support
    * *Intermediate SQL*. Include about half of the new features of SQL-92
    * *Full SQL*. The complete language
* *Purposes*.
    * To make it possible for vendors to achieve full compliance with the standard in steps
    * To make it possible for customers to get an idea of how complete a vendor’s support for SQL-92 really is, at each of these steps

**Regular expressions in SQL**. Reflecting the increased importance of text data,

$\to$ SQL-1999 includes a more powerful version of the `LIKE` operator called `SIMILAR`
* *`SIMILAR` operator*. Allow a rich set of regular expressions to be used as patterns while searching text
    
    $\to$ The regular expressions are similar to those supported by the Unix OS for string searches, although the syntax is a little different
