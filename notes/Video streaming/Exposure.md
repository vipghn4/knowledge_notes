# Exposure
## Introduction
**Irradiance**. The radiant flux received by a surface per unit area
* *Radiant flux and irradiance*.
    * *Radiant flux*. Also known as radiant power. The radiant energy emitted, reflected, transmitted, or received, per unit time
        * *Formula*. $\Phi_e=\frac{\partial Q_e}{\partial t}$ where $Q_e$ is the radiant energy emitted, reflected, transmitted, or received
    * *Radiant irradiance*. $E_e=\frac{\partial \Phi_e}{\partial A}$ where $A$ is the area
* *Frequency spectral flux and radiance*. The radiant flux per unit frequency or wavelength
    * *Frequency spectral flux*. $\Phi_{e,\nu}=\frac{\partial \Phi_e}{\partial \nu}$ where $\nu$ is the frequency
    * *Frequency spectral irradiance*. $E_{e,\nu} = \frac{\partial E_e}{\partial \nu}$
* *Wavelength spectral flux and radiance*.
    * *Wavelength spectral flux*. $\Phi_{e,\lambda}=\frac{\partial \Phi_e}{\partial \lambda}$ where $\lambda$ is the frequency 
    * *Wavelength spectral irradiance*. $E_{e,\lambda} = \frac{\partial E_e}{\partial \lambda}$

**Exposure**. Amount of light per unit area, i.e. image plane illumiance times the exposure time, reaching a frame of photographic film or the surface of an electronic image sensor
* *Shutter speed*. Exposure is determined by shutter speed, lens aperture, and scene luminance
    * *Explain*. An exposure is a single shutter cycle
* *Formulas*.
    * *Assumptions*.
        * $E_e$ is the irradiance of the surface, i.e. the radiant flux (power) received by a surface per unit area
            * *Unit of measurement*. $W/m^2$
        * $E_v$ is the illuminance, i.e. the total luminous flux incident on a surface per unit area,  of the surface, measured in lux
        * $t$ is the exposure duration, measured in seconds
    * *Radiant exposure of a surface*. $H_e = E_e t$
    * *Luminous exposure of a surface*. $H_v=E_v t$

## Optimum exposure
**Correct exposure**. An exposure which achieving the effect the photographer intended
* *Dynamic range*. A photographic film, or sensor, has a physically limited useful exposure range, called its dynamic range

    $\to$ If, for any part of the photgraph, the actual exposure is outside the range, the film cannot record it accurately
* *Exposure adjustment and/or lighting adjustment*. Control the physical amount of light from the subject, which is allowed to fall on the film

    $\to$ SO that "significant" areas of shadow and highlight detail do not exceed the film's useful exposure range
    * *Purpose*. Ensure that no significant information is lost during capture

**Overexposure and underexposure**. The photographer may carefully overexpose or underexpose the photograph to eliminate insignificant or unwanted detail

>**NOTE**. It is technically much easier to discard recorded information during postprocessing, than trying to recreate unrecorded information

* *Overexposed photograph*. A photograph which has a loss of highlight detail
* *Underexposed photograph*. A photograph which has a loss of shadow detail

**Exposure settings**.
* *Manual exposure*. The photographer adjusts the lens aperture and / or shutter speed to achieve the desired exposure
* *Automatic exposure*. The camera automatically calculates and adjusts exposure settings to match, as closely as possible, the subject's mid-tone to the mid-tone of the photograph
    * *Aperture priority*. Give the photographer manual control of the aperture
    * *Shutter priority*. Give the photographer manual control of the shutte
