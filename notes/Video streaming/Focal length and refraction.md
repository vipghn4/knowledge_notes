# Focal length and refraction
## Introduction
**Focal length of an optical system**. A measure of how strongly the system converges or diverges light

* *Focal length signs*.
    * *Positive focal length*. Indicate that a system converges light
    * *Negative focal length*. Indicate that the system diverges light
* *Focal length magnitudes*. A system with shorter focal length bends the rays more sharply

    $\to$ This brings the rays to focus in a shorter distance, or diverging them more quickly
* *Field-of-view*. Longer focal length leads to higher magnification and a narrower angle of view

**Thin lens approximation**. 
* *Focal length*. The distance from the center of the lens to the principal focal points of the lens
    * *Convex lens*. The distance, at which a beam of collimated light will be focused to a single spot
        * *Focal length's sign*. Positive, i.e. converging
    * *Concave lens*. The distance to the point, from which a collimated beam apperas to be diverging after passing through the lens
      * *Focal length's sign*. Negative, i.e. diverging
* *Relationship between focal length and distance to objects*.

    * *Assumptions*.
        * $d_o$ is the distance from the object to the lens, e.g. $20$ centimeters
        * $d_i$ is the distance from the lens to the image, e.g. $5$ centimeters
        * $f$ is the focal length
    * *Thin-lens equation*. $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_1}$
    * *Magnification*. $m=-\frac{d_i}{d_o}$

## Refraction by lenses
**Refraction**. The bending of the path of a light wave as it passes from one material into another material
* *Refraction point*. The refraction occurs at the boundary, and is caused by change in the speed of the light wave upon crossing the boundary
    * *Ray bending tendency*. Depend on whether the light wave speeds up or slows down upon crossing the boundary
    * *Speed of light wave*. Depend on the optical density of the material, through which it moves
* *General explanation*. When a wave moves into a slower medium, the wavefronts get compressed

    $\to$ This shortens the wave length while keeping the frequency of the wave, thus slows down the velocity of the wave

* *Snell's law*.

        <figcaption>Refraction of light</figcaption>
    </div>

    * *Assumptions*.
        * $\theta_1$ is the angle of indidence, and $\theta_2$ is the angle of refraction
        * $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the phase velocities in the two media
        * $n_1 = c/v_1$ and $n_2 = c/v_2$ are the indices of refraction of the two media
    * *Conclusion*. $\frac{\sin \theta_1}{\sin\theta_2} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{n_2}{n_1}$
* *Generalization*. Snell's law is applicable for all kinds of waves, e.g. acoustics, water waves, etc., not only light waves

**Refraction by lenses**.
* *Refraction by converging lens*. 
    * *Refraction points*.
        * As a ray of light enters a lens, it is refracted
        * As a ray of light exits a lens, it is refracted again
    * *Consequence*. Images are formed depending on the geometric shape of the lens
* *Refraction model of lights*.

## Concepts
**Lenses**. A carefully ground or molded piece of transparent material which refracts light rays to form an image

**Types of lenses**. 
* *Convex lenses*.
    * *Plano-convex*. Flat on one side and convex on the other
    * *Bi-convex*. Convex on both sides
* *Concave lenses*.
    * *Plano-concave*. Flat on one side and concave on the other
    * *Bi-concave*. Concave on both sides
* *Concavo-convex lenses*. Convex on one side and concave on the other, with concave surface radius greater than convex surface radius
* *Convexo-concave lenses*. Concave on one side and convex on the other, with concave surface radius less than convex surface radius

**Phase velocity of a wave**. The rate, at which the wave propagates in some mediu
