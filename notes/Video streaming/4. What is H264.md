# 4. What is H264
## What is H264
**H264**.
* *Definitions from points of view*.
    * An industrial standard defining a format for compressed video data
    * Provide a set of tools which can be used in a variety of ways to compress and communicate visual information
    * A stage in an evolving series of standardized methods for video compression

**H264 as a video compression format**. H264 is a method and format for video compression
* *Components*.
    * *Encoder*. Convert video into a compressed format
    * *Decoder*. Convert compressed video back into an uncompressed format
* *Overall data flow*.
    1. A video from a camera is encoded or compressed with H264 to produce an H264 bitstream
    2. The bitstream is sent across a network to a decoder
    3. The decoder reconstructs a version of the source video

**H264 as an industrial standard**. ITU-T and ISO/IEC co-published a document (the reference documentation) as given in reference documentation below
* *Reference documentation*. "Recommendation H.264: Advanced video coding"
    * *Content*.  
        * A format or syntax for compressed video
        * A method for decoding the syntax to produce a displayable video sequence
* *Video encoding*. The standard document does not specify how to encode the digital video

    $\to$ This is left to the manufacturer of a video encoder

    </div>

* *H.264/AVC standard*. Published in 2003, with several revisions and updates published since then
    * *Foundations*. Built on the concepts of earlier standards, e.g. MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 Visual
    * *Benefits*. Potential for better compression efficiency, i.e.
        * Better-quality compressed video
        * Greater flexibility in compressing, transmitting, and storing video

**H264 as a toolkit for video compression**. H264 specifies how video coded with the given tools should be represented and decoded

$\to$ A video encoder may choose which tools to use and how to apply them to the current video sequence, with some constraints
* *Profile*. An H264-compliant decoder must be capable of using a defined subset of tools, known as a profile

**Better video compression**. One of the most important drivers for the standardization of H264 and its subsequent adoption by industry
* *Explain*. H264 offers significantly better compression performance than MPEG-2 Visual, with the same video resolution and image quality

## How does an H264 codec work

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/media/M5avL4h.png">
    <figcaption>Video codec: High level view</figcaption>
</div>

**Idea**.
* *Encoder*. Carry out prediction, transforming, and encoding processes to produce a compressed H264 bitstream
* *Decoder*. Carry out the complementary processes of decoding, inverse transform, and reconstruction to produce a decoded video sequence

**Structure of H264 encoder**.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/media/AsCl6tl.png">
    <figcaption>Typical H264 encoder</figcaption>
</div>

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/media/cpNawl5.png">
    <figcaption>Typical H264 decoder</figcaption>
</div>

* *Macroblock (MB)*. Data is processed in units of a MB corresponding to $16\times 16$ displayed pixels
* *Encoding procedure*.
    1. A prediction MB is generated and subtracted from the current MB to form a residual MB
    2. The residual MB is transformed, quantized, and encoded
    3. In parallel, the quantized data are re-scaled and inverse transformed and added to the prediciton MB to reconstruct a coded version of the frame
    4. The reconstructed frame is stored for later predictions
* *Decoding procedure*.
    1. A MB is decoded, re-scaled, and inverse transformed to form a decoded residual MB
    2. The decoder generates the same prediction, which was created at the encoder, and add it to the residual to produce a decoded MB

### Encoder processes
**Prediction**. The encoder forms a prediction of the current MB based on previously-coded data
* *Idea*.
    * *Methods*.
        * *Intra prediction*. Predict using current frame
        * *Iter prediction*. Predict using previously transmitted frames
    * *Residual block*. Formed by subtracting the prediction from the current MB
* *Benefits of H264 encoding*.
    * More flexible than previous standards
    * Enable accurate predictions, and thus efficient video compression
* *Intra and inter prediction*.

    <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="/media/pygnpgk.png">
        <figcaption>Intra prediction</figcaption>
    </div>

    * *Intra prediction*. Use $16\times 16$ and $4\times 4$ block sizes to predict the MB from surrounding, previously coded pixels within the same frame
        * *Idea*. Extrapolate the values of the previously-coded neighboring pixels to form a prediction of the current MB

    <div style="text-align:center">
        <img src="/media/Ev3NZQW.png">
        <figcaption>Inter prediction</figcaption>
    </div>

    * *Iter prediction*. Use a range of block sizes from $16\times 16$ down to$4\times 4$ to predict pixels in the current frame, from similar regions in previously coded frames

        >**NOTE**. Previously coded frames may occur before or after the current frame in display order

**Transform and quantization**.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/media/ezpMvYC.png">
    <figcaption>Transform and quantization in encoder</figcaption>
</div>

* *Transformation*. A block of residual samples is transformed using a $4\times 4$ or $8\times 8$ integer transform, i.e. an approximate form of the discrete cosine transform (DCT)

$\to$ The transform outputs a set of coefficients, which are weighting values for standard basis pattern
* *Quantization*. Each block of transform coefficients is quantized by being divided by an integer value, and rounded to the nearest integer, i.e.

    $$x_\text{quantized}=n\cdot \text{round}(x/n)$$

    where $n$ is the quantization parameter (QP)
    * *Output*. A quantized block, whose most or all of the coefficients are zero, with a few zero coefficients

**Bitstream encoding**.
* *Values to be encoded*.
    * Quantized transform coefficients
    * Information to enable the decoder to re-create the prediction
    * Information about the structure of the compressed data, and the compression tools used during encoding
    * Information about the complete video sequence
* *Coding process*. Values mentioned above, paramters, syntax elements, are converted into binary codes, using variable-length coding and / or arithmetic coding

    $\to$ The encoded bitstream can then be stored and / or transmitted

### Decoder process
**Bitstream decoding**. The decoding procedure is given below
1. The video decoder receives the compressed H264 bitstream
2. The decoder decodes each of the syntax elements and extracts the encoded information
3. The extracted information is used to reverse the coding process, and recreate a sequence of video images

**Rescaling and inverse transform**.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/media/mBUCxUF.png">
    <figcaption>Rescaling quantized coefficients</figcaption>
</div>

* *Rescaling*. Also known as *inverse quantization*. The quantized transform coefficients are re-scaled, i.e.

    $$\hat{x}=n\cdot x_\text{quantized}$$

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/media/3kjss6P.png">
    <figcaption>Inverse transform</figcaption>
</div>

* *Inverse transform*. Combine the standard basic patterns, weighted by the re-scaled coefficients, to re-create each block of residual data

**Reconstruction**. For each MB, the decoder forms an identical prediction to the one created by the encoder using inter prediction or intra prediction

$\to$ The decoder adds the prediction to the decoded residual to reconstruct a decoded MB, which can then be displayed as part of a video frame

## The H264/AVC standard
**The current version of Recommendation H264**. A document of over 550 pages
* *Content*. Normative content, essential instructions which must be observed by H264 codecs, and informative content, guidance which is not mandatory
* *H264 bitstream format*. Should conform to the syntax definition, with syntax elements constructed according to the semantics given in Chapter 7 of the standard
* *Decoding process*. Should follow the parsing process given in Chapter 9 of the standard to extract syntax elements from the bitstream

## H264 profiles and levels
**H264 toolkit**. A portforlio of tools, which are algorithms or processes for coding and decoding video and related operations

$\to$ These include tools essential to any implementation of H264
* *Example*.
    * Basic $4\times 4$ transform
    * Optional or interchangeable tools, e.g. CABAC or CAVLC entropy coding
    * Tools for specific applications or scenarios, e.g. SI/SP tools for video streaming
    * Tools not directly related to video coding, e.g. VUI and SEI messages

>**NOTE**. Under the perspective of decoder, we do not necessarily use the tools of H264. We only need to care about satisfying the syntax of the profile

**Toolset for encoding and decoding**.
* *Encoding*. Considerable flexibility in choosing and using tools defined in the standard
* *Decoding*. Capable of operating with a very limited set of tools

**H264 profile**. Each profile define a specific tool set

$\to$ An H264 bitstream conforming a particular profile can only contain video coded using some or all of the tools within the profile
* *Profile-compliant decoder*. Must be capable of decoding with every tool in the profile
* *Consequence*. The profiles therefore act as constraints on the capabilities required by a decoder
* *Common profiles*.
    * *Main Profile*. The most widely used profile, with tools that offer a good compromise between compression performance and computational complexity
    * *Constrained Baseline Profile*. A subset of the Main Profile, which is popular for low-complexity, low-delay applications, e.g. mobile video

**Amount of data handled by a decoder**. There is a limit on the amount of data handled by a decoder
* *Aspects limiting the amount of processed data*. Processing speed, memory capacity, and display size at the decoder
* *H264/AVC level*. Specify
    * An upper limit on the frame size
    * Processing rate (number of frames or blocks can be decoded per second)
    * Working memory required to decode a video sequence

>**NOTE**. A particular decoder can only decode H264 bitstreams up to a certain combination of profile and Level

## The H264 syntax
<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/media/uvQkl5T.png">
    <figcaption>H264 syntax overview</figcaption>
</div>

**Syntax for representing compressed video and related information**.
* *Top level*. A H264 sequence consists of a series of packets, or Network Adaption Layer Units  (NAL Units or NALUs), which can include
    * *Parameter sets*. Contain key parameters used be the decoder to correctly decode the video data
    * *Slices*. Coded video frames or parts of video frames
* *Next level*.
    * *Slice*. A slice represents all or part of a coded video frame, and consists of a number of coded MB
    * *Macroblock*. Each MB contains compressed data to a $16\times 16$ block of displayed pixels in a video frame

## H264 in practice
### Performance
**Advantages over MPEG-2 and MPEG-4**. Better image quality at the same compressed bitrate, or a lower compressed bitrate for the same image quality

# Appendix
## Concepts
**H264 standard**. Define the syntax of the encoded bitstream
* *Developers' responsibilities*.
    * A development methodology which enables experimentation and refinements of their algorithms
    * The ability to deliver a real-time encoding of the video

**CPU implementation**. CPU architectures are not well suited for video processing
* *Approach*. Augment the CPU with hardware acceleration units called intrinsic instructions, e.g. Intel's MMX/SSE2 and AMD's 3DNow extensions
    * *Idea*. Design the acceleration hardware to support the block-based and pixel-level processing tasks, which are not efficiently handled by the CPU architecture
* *Drawbacks*. Many of the core encoding tasks, e.g. motion estimation, which consume many CPU cycles, are also very dataflow intensive

    $\to$ They require deep register pipelines with fast memory accesses

    >**NOTE**. Traditionally, this requirement has been best met with a purely hardware approach

**Definitions of H264 profiles**.
* *Definition from official documentation of H264*. A profile is a subset of the entire bitstream syntax
    * *Variability of encoding and decoding*. Within the bounds imposed by the syntax of a given profile

        $\to$ It is still possible to require a very large variation in the performance of encoders and decoders, depending upon the values taken by syntax elements in the bitstream
        * *Example*. The performance of encoders and decoders may depend on the specified size of the decoded pictures

    >**NOTE**. Under the perspective of a decoder, it only cares about the syntax of the input bitstream, thus a profile is defined as a set of constraints on bitstream

* *Definition from Wikipedia*. H264 defines several sets of capabilities, which are referred as *profiles*, targeting specific classes of applications
    * *Purpose*. Allow a decoder to recognize the requirements for decoding the specific bitstream

>**NOTE**. Definition from official documentation gives the definition from the perspective of decoder, while definition given in the book is from the perspective of encoder

**Definitions of H264 levels**.
* *Definition from official documentation of H264*.
    * *Motivation*. In many applications, it is currently neither practical nor economic to implement a decoder capable of dealing with all hypothetical uses of the syntax within a particular profile
    * *Levels*. A set of constraints, which are specified within each profile, on values  of the syntax elements in the bitstream
        * *Example of level constraints*. Limit constraints on values, or arithmetic combinations of values
* *Definition from Wikipedia*. A level is a specified set of constraints indicating a degree of required decoder performance for a profile
    * *Example*. Maximum picture resolution, frame rate, and bitrate which may be used by a decoder
    * *Explain*. A decoder conforming a given level must be able to decode all bitstreams encoded for that level, and all lower levels
* *Story from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/handbrake/comments/b8yzd3/i_cant_understand_what_encoder_level_is/)*.
    * *Motivation for H264 levels*. It is tricky to guarantee that digital video files worked properly on some specific device

        $\to$ There are types of different devices trying to do their best but can only work properly for certain file types
    * *Purpose of H264 level*. H264 wants to have a level of guaranteed operability for playback
        * *Example*.
            * *Level 1*. Support 2 settings
                * $176\times 144$ pixels at $15$ FPS, with a maximum bitrate of $64$kb/s
                * $128\times 96$ pixels at $30$ FPS, with a maximum bitrate of $64$kb/s
            * *Level 1b*. Same resolution and frame rate as level 1, but with $128$ kbps

**How different versions of H264 be compatible with each other**
