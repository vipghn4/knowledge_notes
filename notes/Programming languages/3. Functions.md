# 3. Functions
## Functions
### Function objects
**Key note**. Functions in JS are objects

**Properties of functions**.
* *Functions as objects*. Function objects are linked to `Function.prototype`, which is itself linked to `Object.prototype`
* *Other hidden properties*.
    * Function's context
    * Function's code
* *`property`*. Every function is created with `property` property
    * *`property` object*. an object with a `constructor` property, whose value is the function

**Consequences of function as an object**. Functions can be used like any other value, e.g.
* Stored in variables, objects, and arrays
* Passed as arguments to functions
* Returned from functions
* Have methods

**Special thing about functions**. Functions can be invoked

### Function literal
**Function literal as object**.

```javascript=
var func_name = function(<params>) {
    <statements>
}
```

**Function name**. Function name is optional
* *Usage*.
    * Recursive calls
    * Used by debuggers and development tools to identify the function
* *Anonymous function*. A function without name

**Closure**. The function object created by a function literal contains a link to that outer context

$\to$ This is the source of enormouse expressive power

### Invocation
**Arguments**. In addition to the declared parameters, every function receives two additional parameters, i.e. `this` and `arguments`
* *`this` parameter*. Like `self` in Python, i.e. value is determined by the invocation pattern

>**NOTE**. There is no runtime error when the number of arguments and the number of parameters do not match
>* If there are too many argument values, the extra arguments are ignored
>* If there are too few argument values, the `undefined` value will be substituted for the missing arguments

>**NOTE**. There is no type checking on the argument values

**Method invocation pattern**. When a function is stored as a property of an object
* *`this` parameter*. Bound to the underlying object
* *Usage of `this`*. Access the object, so that the method can retrieve values from the object, or modify the object

**Function invocation pattern**. When a function is not the property of an object
* *`this` parameter*. Boud to the global object

    >**NOTE**. `this` should be bound to `this` of the outer function, which invokes the underlying function
    >$\to$ This is a design error

* *Consequences*. A method cannot employ an innter function to help it do its work
    * *Explain*. The inner function does not share the method's access to the object, since it is bound to the wrong value
    * *Solution*. If the method defines a variable, and assign it the value of `this`

        $\to$ The inner function will have access to `this` through this variable, since it has access to the method's context

**Constructor invocation pattern**. When a function is invoked with the `new` prefix, a new object will be created with a hidden link to the value of the function's `prototype` member
* *`this` parameter*. Bound to the newly created object

**Apply invocation pattern**. The `apply` method of a function lets us construct an array of arguments to use to invoke a function
* *Example code*.

    ```javascript=
    var add = function(a, b){
        return a + b;
    }
    
    var array = [3, 4];
    var sum = add.apply(null, array); // sum is 7
    ```
* *Arguments of `apply`*.
    * First argument is the value, which should be bound to `this`
    * Second argument is an array of parameters

### Arguments
**`arguments`**. An array, which is a bonus parameter available to functions when they are invoked
* *Usage*. Give the function access to all of the arguments, which are supplied with the invocation, including excess arguments which are not assigned to parameters

    $\to$ We can write functions taking unspecified number of parameters
* *Example code*.

    ```javascript=
    var sum = function() {
        var i, sum = 0;
        for(i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++){
            sum += arguments[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }
    
    sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    ```

>**NOTE**. `arguments` is a design error, i.e. it is not really an array, but an array-like object, with `length` property, but lacking all of the array methods

### Return
>**NOTE**. If a function was invoked with the `new` prefix, and the `return` value is not an object
>$\to$ `this` (the new object) is returned instead

### Exceptions
**`throw` statement**. Interrupt execution of the function to raise an `exception` object
* *Exception object*. Contain at least the following properties
    * A `name` property identifying the type of the exception
    * A descriptive `message` property
* *Example code*.
    ```javascript=
    throw {
        name: "TypeError",
        message: "Add needs numbers"
    };
    ```

**`try`-`catch` block**. Catch `exception` object
* *Example code*
    ```javascript=
    var try_it = function(){
        try{
            // do something
        } catch(e){
            print(e.name + ": " + e.message);
        }
    }
    ```

>**NOTE**. A `try` staement with a single `catch` block will catch all exceptions

### Augmenting types
**Principle**. JS allows the basic types of the language to be augmented

* *Example*. 
    * *Example 1*. Augment `Function.prototype` with a method `method`

        ```javascript=
        Function.prototype.method = function(name, func){
            this.prototype9[name] = func;
            return this;
        }
        ```
    * *Example 2*. Explicit integer type

        ```javascript=
        Number.method("integeter", function(){
            return Math[this < 0? "ceiling" : "floor"](this);
        });
        ```

>**NOTE**. The prototypes of basic types are public structures
>$\to$ Care must be taken when mixing libraries

**Trick**. 
* Only if the method is known to be missing, then add it
* The `for...in` statement interacts badly with prototypes

### Recursion
>**NOTE**. Some languages offer the tail recursion optimization, but JS does not
>* *Tail recursion optimization*. If a function returns the result of invoking itself recursively, then the invocation is replaced with a loop to significantly speed things up

### Scope
**Scope**. Control the visbility and lifetimes of variables and parameters
* *Block scope*. ALl variables defined in a block are not visible from outside of the block
* *Function scope*. Like Python
    * The parameters and variables defined in a function are not visible outside of the function
    * A variable defined within a function is visible everywhere within the function

**Scope in JS**. 
* JS does not have block scope, even though its block syntax suggests that it does

    $\to$ This confusion can be a source of errors
* JS has function scope

**Trick**. 
* Due to the lack of block scope, the recommendation that variables should be declared as late as possible is not for JS
    
    $\to$ It is best to declare all of the variables used in a function at the top of the function body

### Closure
**Closure**. Inner functions have access to the parameters and variables of the outer functions is a very good thing

**Protecting properties from unauthorized changes**. We may want to treat properties of some object as private properties
* *Solution 1*. Initialize the object by calling a function which returns an object literal
    * *Example code*.

        ```javascript=
        var myObject = function(){
            var value = 0; // we want to protect `value` from unauthorized changes
            
            return {
                increment: function(inc){
                    value += typeof inc == "number" ? inc : 1;
                },
                getValue: function(){
                    return value;
                }
            };
        }();
        ```
        
        >**NOTE**. In this code above, the outer functions `increment` and `getValue` have longer lifetime than their outer function
        
        >**NOTE**. We are not assigning a function to `myObject`. We are assigning the result of invoking that function instead

* *Solution 2*. Initialize the object as below

    ```javascript=
    var object_creator = function(value){
        return {
                increment: function(inc){
                    value += typeof inc == "number" ? inc : 1;
                },
                getValue: function(){
                    return value;
                }
        };
    };
    
    var myObject = object_creator(1);
    ```

>**NOTE**. THe inner function has access to the actual variables of the outer functions, not copies

### Callbacks
**Principle**. Functions can make it easier to deal with discontinuous evens
* *Example*. When sending requests asynchronously

### Module
**Modules**. We can use functions and closure to make modules
* *Module*. A function, or object, which presents an interface but hides its state and implementation
* *Using functions to produce modules*. We can almost completely eliminate our use of global variables

**The general pattern of a module in JS**. A function which 
* Define private variables and functions
* Create privileged functions which, through closure, will have access to the private variables and functions
* Return the privileged functions or store them in an accessible place

### Cascade
**Cascade**. Some methods do not have a return value, e.g. they set or change the state of an object. If we have those methods return `this` instead of `undefined`

$\to$ We can enable cascades
* *Cascade*. Call many methods on the same object in sequence in a single statement
    * *Example*. `myObject.methodA().methodB()`
* *Pros*. 
    * Cascading can produce interfaces, which are very expressive
    * Cascading can help control the tendency to make interfaces, which try to do much at once

### Curry
**Currying**. Allow us to produce a new function by combining a function and an argument
* *Motivation*. Functions are values, and we can manipulate function values in interesting ways
* *Example code*.

    ```javascript=
    Function.method("curry", function(){
        var args = arguments, that = this;
        return function(){
            return that.apply(null, args.concat(arguments))
        };
    });
    
    var add1 = add.curry(1);
    add1(6);
    ```

**Key idea**. 
* Create a closure which holds the original function and the arguments to curry
* Return a function that, when invoked, returns the result of calling the original function, passing it all of the arguments from the invocation of `curry` and the current invocation

### Memoization
**Memoization**. Functions can use objects to remember the results of previous operations to avoid unnecessary work

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Object (JS)**. A collection of name/value pairs having a hidden link to a prototype object
* *`Object.prototype`*. Objects produced from object literals are linked to `Object.prototype`

**Invocation patterns in JS**. There are invocation patterns, which differ in how the parameter `this` is initialized
* Method invocation pattern
* Function invocation pattern
* Constructor invocation pattern
* Apply invocation pattern

**Public methods (JS)**. Methods getting their object context from `this`

**Constructor**. A function, which is intended to be used with the `new` prefix
* *Naming convention*. Capitalized name

>**NOTE**. If a constructor is called without the `new` prefix, very bad things can happen without a compile-time or runtime warning
>$\to$ The capitalization convention is really importan
