# Using structs to structure related data
**Struct (or structure)**. A custom data type for packaging and naming multiple related values, which make up a meaningful group

## Defining and instantiating structs
**Structs and tuples**. 
* *Comparison*. Both hold multiple related values
    * Like tuples, the pieces of a struct can be different types
    * Unlike with tuples, in a struct we name each piece of data
* *Consequence*. Structs are more flexible than tuples
    * *Explain*. We do not have to rely on the order of the data to specify or access the values of an instance

**Using structs**.
* *Struct declaration*.
    * *Example*.

        ```rs
        struct User {
            active: bool,
            username: String,
            email: String,
            sign_in_count: u64,
        }
        ```

* *Struct instance creation*. We create an instance of that struct by specifying concrete values for each of the fields, e.g.

    ```rs
    let user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
    ```

* *Struct elemetn access*. Use dot notation
    * *Example*. To access user’s email address, we could use `user1.email`
    * *Struct mutability*. If the instance is mutable
        
        $\to$ We can change a value by using the dot notation and assigning into a particular field

        >**NOTE**. The entire instance must be mutable, i.e. Rust does not allow us to mark only certain fields as mutable

**Convention**. It makes sense to name the function parameters with the same name as the struct fields
* *Problem*. If the struct had many fields, repeating each name would get even more annoying

### Using the field init shorthand
**Field init shorthand syntax**. Used to rewrite quickly create an instance of a struct without specifying the name of each field
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
        User {
            email,
            username,
            active: true,
            sign_in_count: 1,
        }
    }
    ```

### Creating instances from other instances with struct update syntax
**Struct update syntax**. Create a new instance of a struct that includes most of the values from another instance, but changes some
* *Syntax*. Use `..` to specify that the remaining fields not explicitly set should have the same value as the fields in the given instance
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    let user2 = User {
        active: user1.active,
        username: user1.username,
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
    };
    ```

    is equivalent to

    ```rs
    let user2 = User {
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        ..user1
    };
    ```

**Struct update as a move**. The struct update syntax uses `=` like an assignment
* *Explain*. It moves the data, i.e. we cannot use `user1` after creating `user2` 
    * *Explain*. The String in the `username` field of `user1` was moved into `user2`
    * *Consequence*. If only types implementing the `Copy` trait are moved

        $\to$ `user1` would still be valid after creating `user2`

### Using tuple Structs without named field to create different types
Rust also supports structs that look similar to tuples, called tuple structs. Tuple structs have the added meaning the struct name provides but don’t have names associated with their fields; rather, they just have the types of the fields. Tuple structs are useful when you want to give the whole tuple a name and make the tuple a different type from other tuples, and when naming each field as in a regular struct would be verbose or redundant.

To define a tuple struct, start with the struct keyword and the struct name followed by the types in the tuple. For example, here we define and use two tuple structs named Color and Point:


struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

fn main() {
    let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
    let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
}
Note that the black and origin values are different types, because they’re instances of different tuple structs. Each struct you define is its own type, even though the fields within the struct have the same types. For example, a function that takes a parameter of type Color cannot take a Point as an argument, even though both types are made up of three i32 values. Otherwise, tuple struct instances behave like tuples: you can destructure them into their individual pieces, you can use a . followed by the index to access an individual value, and so on.
