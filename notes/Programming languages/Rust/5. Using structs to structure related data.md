# Using structs to structure related data
**Struct (or structure)**. A custom data type for packaging and naming multiple related values, which make up a meaningful group

## Defining and instantiating structs
**Structs and tuples**. 
* *Comparison*. Both hold multiple related values
    * Like tuples, the pieces of a struct can be different types
    * Unlike with tuples, in a struct we name each piece of data
* *Consequence*. Structs are more flexible than tuples
    * *Explain*. We do not have to rely on the order of the data to specify or access the values of an instance

**Using structs**.
* *Struct declaration*.
    * *Example*.

        ```rs
        struct User {
            active: bool,
            username: String,
            email: String,
            sign_in_count: u64,
        }
        ```

* *Struct instance creation*. We create an instance of that struct by specifying concrete values for each of the fields, e.g.

    ```rs
    let user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
    ```

* *Struct elemetn access*. Use dot notation
    * *Example*. To access user’s email address, we could use `user1.email`
    * *Struct mutability*. If the instance is mutable
        
        $\to$ We can change a value by using the dot notation and assigning into a particular field

        >**NOTE**. The entire instance must be mutable, i.e. Rust does not allow us to mark only certain fields as mutable

**Convention**. It makes sense to name the function parameters with the same name as the struct fields
* *Problem*. If the struct had many fields, repeating each name would get even more annoying

### Using the field init shorthand
**Field init shorthand syntax**. Used to rewrite quickly create an instance of a struct without specifying the name of each field
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
        User {
            email,
            username,
            active: true,
            sign_in_count: 1,
        }
    }
    ```

### Creating instances from other instances with struct update syntax
**Struct update syntax**. Create a new instance of a struct that includes most of the values from another instance, but changes some
* *Syntax*. Use `..` to specify that the remaining fields not explicitly set should have the same value as the fields in the given instance
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    let user2 = User {
        active: user1.active,
        username: user1.username,
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
    };
    ```

    is equivalent to

    ```rs
    let user2 = User {
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        ..user1
    };
    ```

**Struct update as a move**. The struct update syntax uses `=` like an assignment
* *Explain*. It moves the data, i.e. we cannot use `user1` after creating `user2` 
    * *Explain*. The String in the `username` field of `user1` was moved into `user2`
    * *Consequence*. If only types implementing the `Copy` trait are moved

        $\to$ `user1` would still be valid after creating `user2`

### Using tuple Structs without named field to create different types
**Tuple structs**. Structs that look similar to tuples
* *Tuple structs*. Have the added meaning the struct name provides without names associated with their fields
    
    $\to$ They only have the types of the fields
* *Usage*. 
    * Useful when we want to give the whole tuple a name and make the tuple a different type from other tuples, and
    * Useful when naming each field as in a regular struct would be verbose or redundant
* *Tuple struct declaration*. Start with the struct keyword and the struct name followed by the types in the tuple
    * *Example*.

        ```rs
        struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
        struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

        fn main() {
            let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
            let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
        }
        ```

* *Tuple struct as a tuple*. 
    * We can destructure them into their individual pieces
    * We can use a `.` followed by the index to access an individual value, etc.

### Unit-like structs without any fields
**Unit-like structs**. Structs that without any fields

$\to$ Such structs behave similarly to `()`, i.e. the unit type
* *Usage*. Useful when you need to implement a trait on some type but do not have any data that you want to store in the type itself
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    struct AlwaysEqual;

    fn main() {
        let subject = AlwaysEqual;
    }
    ```

### Ownership of struct data
**Brief**. Each instance of a struct can own all of its data

$\to$ The data will be valid for as long as the entire struct is valid

**Struct data owned by another variable**. Structs can store references to data owned by other variables

$\to$ To do so requires the use of lifetimes, i.e. a Rust feature
* *Lifetimes*. Ensure that the data referenced by a struct is valid for as long as the struct is
* *Example*. The following code does not compile, i.e. it needs lifetime specifiers

    ```rs
    struct User {
        active: bool,
        username: &str,
        email: &str,
        sign_in_count: u64,
    }

    fn main() {
        let user1 = User {
            email: "someone@example.com",
            username: "someusername123",
            active: true,
            sign_in_count: 1,
        };
    }
    ```

## An example program using structs
**Naive implementation**. Consider the following code

```rs
fn main() {
    let width1 = 30;
    let height1 = 50;

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        area(width1, height1)
    );
}

fn area(width: u32, height: u32) -> u32 {
    width * height
}
```

**Refactoring with tuples**.

```rs
fn main() {
    let rect1 = (30, 50);

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        area(rect1)
    );
}

fn area(dimensions: (u32, u32)) -> u32 {
    dimensions.0 * dimensions.1
}
```

**Refactoring with structs - Adding more meaning**.

```rs
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        area(&rect1)
    );
}

fn area(rectangle: &Rectangle) -> u32 {
    rectangle.width * rectangle.height
}
```

**Adding useful functionality with derived traits**.
* *Traits*. Rust does include functionality operating upon struct fields, but we have to explicitly opt in to make that functionality available for our struct
    
    $\to$ To do this, we need adding the outer attribute `#[derive(Debug)]` right before the struct definition

    ```rs
    #[derive(Debug)]
    struct Rectangle {
        width: u32,
        height: u32,
    }

    fn main() {
        let rect1 = Rectangle {
            width: 30,
            height: 50,
        };
        println!("rect1 is {:?}", rect1);
    }
    ```

>**NOTE**. Rust has provided a number of traits for us to use with the derive attribute that can add useful behavior to our custom types

## Method syntax
**Methods and functions**
* *Similarity*.
    * Both are declared with the `fn` keyword and a name
    * Both can have parameters and a return value
    * Both contain some code run when the method is called from somewhere else
* *Different from functions*. 
    * Methods are defined within the context of a struct, or an enum or a trait object
    * Methods' first parameter is always `self`, i.e. the instance of the struct the method is being called on

### Defining methods
**Method definition**. To define the function within the context of `Rectangle`

$\to$ We start an `impl`, i.e. implementation, block for `Rectangle`
* *Method definition*. Everything within this `impl` block will be associated with the `Rectangle` type
* *Method syntax*. The method syntax goes after an instance, i.e. we add a dot followed by the method name, parentheses, and any arguments
    * *Example*.

        ```rs
        #[derive(Debug)]
        struct Rectangle {
            width: u32,
            height: u32,
        }

        impl Rectangle {
            fn area(&self) -> u32 {
                self.width * self.height
            }
        }

        fn main() {
            let rect1 = Rectangle {
                width: 30,
                height: 50,
            };

            println!(
                "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
                rect1.area()
            );
        }
        ```

* *Self variable*. `&self` is actually short for self, i.e. `self: &Self`
    * *`Self` in an `impl` block*. The type `Self` is an alias for the type that the `impl` block is for
    * *Requirements for `self` parameter*. Methods must have a `self` parameter of type `Self` for their first parameter
        
        >**NOTE**. Rust lets us abbreviate this with only the name `self` in the first parameter spot
        
        >**NOTE**. We need the `&` in front of the `self` to indicate the method borrows the `Self` instance
        
        >**NOTE**. Methods can take ownership of self, borrow self immutably, or borrow self mutably

* *Reason for using methods instead of functions*. 
    * Providing method syntax
    * Not having to repeat the type of `self` in every method’s signature
    * Organization, i.e. put all operations upon an instance of a type in one `impl` block

**Method names and attribute names** Method names and attribute names can coincide, e.g.

```rs
impl Rectangle {
    fn width(&self) -> bool {
        self.width > 0
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    if rect1.width() {
        println!("The rectangle has a nonzero width; it is {}", rect1.width);
    }
}
```

* *Usage*. When we want the method to only return the value in the corresponding field
    
    $\to$ Methods like this are called getters
    
    >**NOTE**. Rust does not implement getters automatically for struct fields as some other languages do

    * *Benefits of getters*. We can make the field private, but the method public
        
        $\to$ This enables read-only access to the field, as part of the type’s public API

### Methods with more parameters

```rs
impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
    }
}
```

### Associated functions
**Associated functions**. 
* *Associated functions*. All functions defined within an `impl` block
    * *Explain*. These functions are associated with the type named after the `impl`
* *Associated functions without `self` parameter*. We can define associated functions without `self` as their first parameter, i.e. these are not methods
    * *Explain*. Such functions do not need an instance of the type to work with

**Constructors**. Non-method associated functions are often used for constructors 
* *Constructor function*. Return a new instance of the struct
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    impl Rectangle {
        fn square(size: u32) -> Rectangle {
            Rectangle {
                width: size,
                height: size,
            }
        }
    }
    ```

* *Constructor invocation*. Use the `::` syntax with the struct name
    * *Example*. 
        
        ```rs
        let sq = Rectangle::square(3);
        ```

### Multiple `impl` blocks
**Brief**. Each struct is allowed to have multiple impl blocks, e.g.

```rs
impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
    }
}
```
