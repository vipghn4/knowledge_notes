# Introduction
## Hello World!
**Writing and running a Rust program**.
* *Rust files*.     
    * *Naming convention*. If we are using more than one word in the filename, use an underscore to separate them
    * *File extension*.`.rs`
* *Compile Rust source files*.
    
    ```bash
    rustc source_file.rs
    # This shoudl results in an executable file ``source_file`` 
    ```

* *Execute compiled Rust code*.

    ```bash
    ./source_file
    ```

**`main` function**. Always the first code running in every executable Rust program
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    fn main() {
        println!("Hello, world!");
    }
    ```

    * *`println!`*. Call a Rust macro, i.e. the `!` symbol
        
        >**NOTE**. If it called a function instead, it would be entered as `println`, i.e. without the `!`
* *Conventions*.
    * Place the opening curly bracket on the same line as the function declaration, adding one space in between
    * Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab

## Hello Cargo!
**Brief**. Compiling with `rustc` works for simple programs

$\to$ As the project grows, we must manage all the options and make it easy to share the code

**Cargo**. Rust’s build system and package manager
* *Brief* Most Rustaceans use this tool to manage their Rust projects
    * *Explain*. Cargo handles a lot of tasks for them, e.g.
        * Building the code
        * Downloading the dependencies
        * Building the downloadded dependencies

### Creating a project with Cargo
**Project creation**.

```bash
cargo new hello_cargo
cd hello_cargo
```

* *Files intialized during project creation*. Cargo generates two files and one directory for us
    * A `Cargo.toml` file
    * A `src` directory with a `main.rs` file inside
    * A new Git repository along with a `.gitignore` file
        
        >**NOTE**. Git files will not be generated if `cargo new` is run within an existing Git repository

* *TOML (Tom’s Obvious, Minimal Language) file*. Cargo’s configuration format
    * *Example `Cargo.toml`*. 

        ```yaml
        [package]
        name = "hello_cargo"
        version = "0.1.0"
        edition = "2021"

        [dependencies]
        ```

    * *`Cargo.toml` file format*. Everything following a header is part of that section that continues until another section starts
    * *`[package]`*. A section heading indicating that the following statements are configuring a package

        $\to$ The internal lines set the configuration information Cargo needs to compile the program, e.g.
        * The name
        * The version
        * The edition of Rust to use
    * *`[dependencies]`*. A section listing all project’s dependencies
* *`src` directory*. Cargo expects source files to live inside the `src` directory
* *Conclusion*. Using Cargo helps organizing our projects

### Building and running a Cargo project
**Building a Cargo project**. Use `cargo build` command
* *Command output*. 
    * *Executable file*. Located in `target/debug/hello_cargo`
        
        $\to$ We can run the executable with command

        ```bash
        ./target/debug/hello_cargo # or .\target\debug\hello_cargo.exe on Windows
        ```

    * *`Cargo.lock` file*. Running `cargo build` for the first time also causes Cargo to create `Cargo.lock` file at the top level
        * *Functionality*. Keep track of the exact versions of dependencies in the project
            
        >**NOTE**. Cargo manages this file's contents for us

* *Building then running project*.

    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

* *Building caching*. If Cargo figured out that the built files had not changed
    
    $\to$ It will not compile the source files again

* *Compile without producing executable file*. Use `cargo check`
    * *Benefits*. `cargo check` is much faster than `cargo build`
        * *Explain*. It skips the step of producing an executable
        * *Consequence*. If we are continually checking our work while writing the code
            
            $\to$ Using `cargo check` will speed up the process
    * *Convention*. Many Rustaceans run `cargo check` periodically as they write their program to make sure it compiles
        
        $\to$ Then they run `cargo **Proces**ld` when they are ready to use the executable

## Example code for a complete project
### Exceptions in Rust
**Example code**.

```rs
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    println!("You guessed: {}", guess);
}
```

**Handling potential failure with the `Result` type**.
* *`Result` type*. Rust has a number of types named `Result` in its standard library, i.e. a generic `Result` and specific versions for submodules, e.g. `io::Result`
    * *Definition*. The `Result` types are enumerations, i.e. `enums`, which can have a fixed set of possibilities known as variants
        * *Enums*. Often used with `match`, i.e. a conditional making it convenient to execute different code based on which variant an enum value is, when the conditional is evaluated
    * *`Result`’s variants*. `Ok` or `Err`
        * *`Ok` variant*. Indicate the operation was successful, and inside `Ok` is the successfully generated value
        * *`Err` variant*. Indicate the operation was failed, and `Err` contains information about how or why the operation failed
    * *Values of the `Result` type*. Like values of any type, have methods defined on them
        * *Example*. An instance of `io::Result` has an `expect` method working as following
            * If this instance of `io::Result` is an `Err` value
                
                $\to$ `expect` will cause the program to crash and display the message passed as an argument to `expect`
                * *Error roots*. If the `read_line` method returns an `Err`
                    
                    $\to$ It would likely be the result of an error coming from the underlying operating system
            * If this instance of `io::Result` is an `Ok` value
                
                $\to$ `expect` will take the return value held by `Ok` and return that value to us for later use
* *Example*. Consider the following line

    ```rs
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess).expect("Failed to read line");
    ```

    * *Data flow*.
        1. `read_line()` returns an `io::Result`

### Crates in Rust
**Crate**. A collection of Rust source code files
* *Examples*. 
    * The project we have been building is a binary crate, which is an executable
    * The `rand` crate is a library crate
* *Library crate*. Contain code intended to be used in other programs, and cannot be executed on its own

>**NOTE**. Cargo’s coordination of external crates is where Cargo really shines

**Adding crates to Cargo**. Before writing code using external crates

$\to$ We need to modify the `Cargo.toml` file to include the crate as a dependency
* *Example*. Be sure to specify the dependency name exactly, with its version number

    ```yaml
    rand = "0.8.3"
    ```

* *`[dependencies]` header in `Cargo.toml`*. Tell Cargo which external crates the project depends on and which versions of those crates are required
    * *Semantic versioning (SemVer)*. Cargo understands SemVer, which is a standard for writing version numbers
        * *Example*. The number `0.8.3` is actually shorthand for `^0.8.3`
            * *Explain*. Any version at least `0.8.3` but below `0.9.0`
                
                $\to$ Cargo considers these versions to have public APIs compatible with version `0.8.3`
            * *Consequence*. This specification ensures we will get the latest patch release, which is still compile with our code
                
                $\to$ Any version `0.9.0` or greater is not guaranteed to have the same API as what the following examples use
* *Inclusion of dependencies*.
    * *Registry*. A copy of data from `Crates.io`, where people in the Rust ecosystem post their open source Rust projects for others to use
    * *Workflow*.
        1. When we include an external dependency
            
            $\to$ Cargo fetches the latest versions of everything that dependency needs from the registry
        2. Cargo checks the `[dependencies]` section and downloads any crates listed, which are not already downloaded
        3. Rust compiles them and then compiles the project with the dependencies available
* *Dependency reuse*. If we immediately run `cargo build` without making any changes
    * Cargo knows it has already downloaded and compiled the dependencies, and we have not changed anything about them in the `Cargo.toml` file
    * Cargo knows that we have not changed anything about our code
        
        $\to$ It does not recompile that either


**Ensuring reproducible builds with the `Cargo.lock` file**. Cargo has a mechanism to ensure that we can rebuild the same artifact every time we builds our code
* *Idea*. Cargo use only the versions of the dependencies we specified, until you indicate otherwise
* *Problem*. If a new version of our dependency may contain an important bug fix, and a regression breaking our code
    * *Solution*. Rust creates the `Cargo.lock` file the first time we run `cargo build`
* *`Cargo.lock` file*. When building a project for the first time, Cargo figures out all the versions of the dependencies, which fit the criteria
    
    $\to$ Cargo writes them to the `Cargo.lock` file
    * *Consequence*. When building the project in the future
        
        $\to$ Cargo will see that the `Cargo.lock` file exists and use the specified versions, rather than doing all the work of figuring out versions again
    * *Benefits*. We have a reproducible build automatically

**Updating a crate to get a new version**. When you do want to update a crate, Cargo provides the command `update`
* *`cargo update` command*. 
    1. Ignore the Cargo.lock file and figure out all the latest versions fitting our specifications in `Cargo.toml`
    2. Write those versions to the `Cargo.lock` file
    3. The next time running `cargo build`, Cargo will update the registry of crates available and reevaluate our dependency requirements according to the new version we have specified

### `loop` in Rust
**`loop` in Rust**. Create an infinite loop
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    loop {
        println!("Please input your guess.");

        // --snip--

        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
        }
    }
    ```

* *Breaking a `loop`*. Use `break` statement

# Appendix
## Concepts
**`rustfmt`**. A rust autoformatting tool

**Crates**. packages of code in Rust

**Formatted string in Rust**. Use `{}`
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    let x = 5;
    let y = 10;
    println!("x = {} and y = {}", x, y);
    ```

**Common crates in Cargo**.
* *`rand::Rng` crate*. Used to generate random numbers, e.g.

    ```rs
    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..101);
    ```

* *`std::cmp::Ordering` crate*. An enum having variants `Less`, `Greater`, and `Equal`, i.e. possible outcomes when comparing two values, e.g.

    ```rs
    match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
    }
    ```

**`match` expression**. Made up of arms
* *Arm*. Each arm consists of a pattern to match against, and the code to run if the value given to match fits that arm’s pattern
* *Workflow*. Rust takes the value given to match and looks through each arm’s pattern in turn
* *`match` as a value*. `match` expression actually returns a value, e.g.

    ```rs
    let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
        Ok(num) => num,
        Err(_) => continue,
    };
    ```

    * *Passing values to `Ok()` and `Err()`*. 
        * If `parse` is able to successfully turn the string into a number
            
            $\to$ It will return an `Ok` value containing the resulting number
            * *Explain*. The `Ok` value will match the first arm’s pattern
                
                $\to$ The `match` expression will return the `num` value produced by parse, and put inside the `Ok` value
        * If `parse` is not able to turn the string into a number
            
            $\to$ It will return an `Err` value containing more information about the error
            * *Explain*. The `Err` value does not match the `Ok(num)` pattern in the first match arm
                
                $\to$ It does match the `Err(_)` pattern in the second arm
            * *Catchall value*. The underscore `_` is a catchall value
                * *Explain*. We want to match all `Err` values, no matter what information they have inside them
                    
                    $\to$ The program effectively ignores all errors that parse might encounter!
* *Usage*. Patterns and the `match` construct are powerful Rust features letting us express a variety of situations our code might encounter and make sure that we handle them all

**Strong static typing in Rust**. Rust has a strong, static type system
* *Type inference*. When writing
    
    ```rs
    let mut guess = String::new()
    ```
    
    $\to$ Rust can infer that `guess` should be a `String` and did not make us write the type

**Value shadowing**. Consider the following code

```rs
let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");
```

$\to$ We create a variable named `guess` but the program already have a variable named `guess`
* *Value shadowing*. Rust allows shadowing the previous value of `guess` with a new one
    * *Shadowing*. Let us reuse the `guess` variable name, rather than forcing us to create two unique variables

**Storing values with variables**.
* *`let` statement*. Used to declare a variable, e.g.

    ```rs
    let apples = 5;
    ```
    
    * *Workflow*. The statement creates a new variable named `apples` and binds it to the value `5`
* *Immutability of variables*. Variables in Rust are immutable by default
    
    $\to$ To make a variable mutable, we add `mut` before the variable name, e.g.

    ```rs
    let mut bananas = 5; // mutable
    ```
