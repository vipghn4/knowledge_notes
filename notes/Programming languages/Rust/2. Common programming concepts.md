# Common programming concepts
## Variables and mutability
**Variable mutability**. By default, variables are immutable

$\to$ This is for the safety and easy concurrency
* *Immutable variable*. When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name
    
    $\to$ We cannot change that value
* *Making a variable mutable*. Use `mut` keyword, i.e. to convey intent to future readers of the code by indicating that other parts of the code will be changing this variable’s value

**Motivating problem**. Attempting to change a value designated as immutable can lead to bugs
* *Explain*. 
    * If one part of our code operates on the assumption that a value will never change and another part of our code changes that value
        
        $\to$ The first part of the code may not do what it was designed to do
    * The cause of this kind of bug can be difficult to track down after the fact, especially when the second piece of code changes the value only sometimes
* *Consequence*. The Rust compiler guarantees that when you state a value will not change, it really will not change
    
    $\to$ We do not have to keep track of it ourself

### Constants
**Constants**. Values bound to a name and are not allowed to change
* *Example*. 

    ```rs
    const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
    ```

    >**NOTE**. The type of the value must be annotated

* *Difference from immutable variables*. 
    * It is not allowed to use `mut` with constants
        * *Explain*. Constants are not just immutable by default, they are always immutable
    * Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope
        
        $\tp$ This makes them useful for values that many parts of code need to know about
    * Constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a value, which could only be computed at runtime
* *Scope of constants*. Constants are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the scope they were declared in
    
    $\to$ This makes constants useful for values in our application domain, which multiple parts of the program might need to know about
* *Common usage*. Naming hardcoded values used throughout our program as constants is useful in conveying the meaning of that value to future maintainers of the code

### Shadowing
**Shadowing**. Rustaceans say that the first variable is shadowed by the second

$\to$ The second variable’s value is what the program sees when the variable is used
* *Syntax*. We can shadow a variable by using the same variable’s name and repeating the use of the `let` keyword, e.g.

    ```rs
    let x = 5;
    let x = x + 1;
    ```

* *Shadowing and mutating a variable* Shadowing is different from marking a variable as `mut`
    * *Explain*. We will get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without using the `let` keyword
        
        $\to$ By using `let`, we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed
    * *Conclusion*. The other difference between mut and shadowing is that because we are effectively creating a new variable when we use the `let` keyword again
        
        $\to$ We can change the type of the value but reuse the same name

## Data types
**Rust as a staticlly typed language**. Rust is a statically typed language

$\to$ It must know the types of all variables at compile time
* *Data type inference*. The compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it
* *Type annotation*. In cases when many types are possible, e.g. when we converted a String to a numeric type using `parse`
    
    $\to$ We must add a type annotation, e.g.

    ```rs
    let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
    ```

### Scalar types
**Scalar type**. Represent a single value
* *Primary scalar types*. Integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters

#### Integer types
**Integer types**.

| Length | Signed | Unsigned |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8-bit | `i8`| `u8` |
| 16-bit | `i16` | `u16` |
| 32-bit | `i32` | `u32` |
| 64-bit | `i64` | `u64` |
| 128-bit | `i128` | `u128` |
| arch | `isize` | `usize` |

* *Architectural types*. `isize` and `usize` types depend on the architecture of the computer architecture
    * *Explain*. 64 bits if you’re on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you’re on a 32-bit architecture
* *Number literals*. 
    * *Type suffix literal*. Number literals, which can be multiple numeric types, allow a type suffix, e.g. `57u8`, to designate the type
    * *Underscore literal*. Number literals can use `_` as a visual separator to make the number easier to read, e.g. `1_000` means `1000`

* *Integer literals in Rust*.

    | Type | Example |
    | --- | --- |
    | Decimal | 98_222 |
    | Hex | 0xff |
    | Octal | 0o77 |
    | Binary | 0b1111_0000 |
    | Byte (u8 only) | b'A' |

>**NOTE**. Integer types default to `i32`

>**NOTE**> The primary situation for using `isize` or `usize` is when indexing some sort of collection

**Integer overflow**.
* *Example*. Consider a variable of type `u8`, if we try to change the variable to a value outside of `u8`'s range, e.g. 256
    
    $\to$ Integer overflow will occur, resulting in one of two behaviors
    * *Case 1*. When compiling in debug mode
        
        $\to$ Rust includes checks for integer overflow causing the program to panic at runtime if the behavior occurs
    * *Case 2*. When compiling in release mode with the `--release` flag
        
        $\to$ Rust does not include checks for integer overflow that cause panics, i.e. it performs two’s complement wrapping, i.e.
        * Values greater than the type's maximum value “wrap around” to the minimum of the values the type can hold
            * *Examples*. `256` becomes `0`, `257` becomes `1`, etc.
            * *Consequence*. The program will not panic, but the variable will have an unexpected value
                
                $\to$ Relying on integer overflow’s wrapping behavior is considered an error
* *Handling overflow*. Use the following families of methods provided by the standard library for primitive numeric types
    * *Option 1*. Wrap in all modes with the `wrapping_*` methods, e.g. `wrapping_add`
    * *Option 2*. Return the `None` value if there is overflow with the `checked_*` methods
    * *Option 3*. Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the `overflowing_*` methods
    * *Option 4*. Saturate at the value’s minimum or maximum values with `saturating_*` methods

#### Floating-point types
**Floating-point types**. Rust’s floating-point types are `f32` and `f64`, i.e. 32-bits and 64-bits floating-point numbers
* *Default type*. `f64`, since on modern CPUs it’s roughly the same speed as `f32` but is capable of more precision
    
    >**NOTE**. All floating-point types are signed


* *Floating-point representation*. Follow IEEE-754 standard
* *Floating-point precision*.
    * The `f32` type is a single-precision float
    * The `f64` type is a double precision float

**Numeric operations**. Rust supports the basic mathematical operations for all of the number types, i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder

>**NOTE**. Integer division rounds down to the nearest integer

#### The Boolean type
**Boolean type**. A Boolean type in Rust has two possible values, i.e. `true` and `false`
* *Type size*. Booleans are one byte in size

#### The character type
**Character type**. Rust’s char type is the language’s most primitive alphabetic type
* *Char literals*. Note that we specify char literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes
* *Type size*. Rust’s char type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value
    
    $\to$ It can represent a lot more than ASCII

### Compound types
**Compound types**. Obtained by grouping multiple values into one type
* *Primitive compound types*. tuples and arrays

#### The tuple type
**Tuple**. A general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type
* *Tuple size*. Tuples have a fixed length, i.e. once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size
* *Tuple declaration*. We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses
    * *Element type*. Each position in the tuple has a type
        
        >**NOTE**. The types of the different values in the tuple do not have to be the same

    * *Example*.

        ```rs
        let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
        ```

**Tuple element access**.
* *Tuple destructuring*. To get the individual values out of a tuple
    
    $\to$ We can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, e.g.

    ```rs
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);
    let (x, y, z) = tup;
    ```

* *Tuple element access*. We can access a tuple element directly by using a period, i.e. `.`, followed by the index of the value we want to access, e.g.

    ```rs
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
    let five_hundred = x.0;
    let six_point_four = x.1;
    let one = x.2;
    ```

**Zero-sized tuples**. The tuple without any values, `()`, is a special type that has only one value, i.e. `()`

$\to$ The type is called the unit type and the value is called the unit value

>**NOTE**. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they do not return any other value

#### The array type
**Brief**. Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an array

**Array**. 
* *Array in Rust*.
    * Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type
    * Unlike arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length
* *Array declaration*. We write the values in an array as a comma-separated list inside square brackets, e.g.

    ```rs
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    ```

* *Other array literals*.
    * *Array literal with element types*. Use square brackets with the type of each element, a semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array

        ```rs
        let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        ```

    * *Array literal with initial values*. We can also initialize an array to contain the same value for each element
        * *Syntax*. Specify the initial value, followed by a semicolon, and then the length of the array in square brackets, e.g.

            ```rs
            let a = [3; 5];
            ```

* *Usage*. Arrays are useful when 
    * We want our data allocated on the stack rather than the heap, or
    * We want to ensure we always have a fixed number of elements

**Array versus vector**. An array isn’t as flexible as the vector type
* *Vector*. A similar collection type provided by the standard library, which is allowed to grow or shrink in size
    
    $\to$ If we are unsure whether to use an array or a vector, chances are we should use a vector

**Accessing array elements**. An array is a single chunk of memory of a known, fixed size that can be allocated on the stack

$\to$ We can access elements of an array using indexing, e.g.

```rs
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let first = a[0];
let second = a[1];
```

## Functions
**Functions**.
* *Function definition*. Type `fn` followed by a function name and a set of parentheses
    
    $\to$ The curly brackets tell the compiler where the function body begins and ends, e.g.

    ```rs
    fn some_function() {
        println!("Some function.");
    }
    ```

    * *Naming convention*. Use snake case, i.e. letters are lowercase and underscores separate words
* *Function invocation*. Enter the function's name followed by a set of parentheses
    
    >**NOTE**. Rust does not care where you define your functions, only that they are defined somewhere

### Parameters
**Function with parameter**.
* *Function signatures*. We must declare the type of each parameter
    * *Explain*. By requiring type annotations in function definitions 
        
        $\to$ The compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in the code to figure out what type we mean
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    fn print_labeled_measurement(value: i32, unit_label: char) {
        println!("The measurement is: {}{}", value, unit_label);
    }
    ```

### Statement and expressions
**Function bodies**. Made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression

**Rust as an expression-based language**. 
* *Statements versus expressions*. This is an important distinction to understand
    * *Statements*. Instructions performing some action and do not return a value

        $\to$ We cannot assign a let statement to another variable
        * *Example*. `let` statement, function definitions

            ```rs
            let y = 6;
            ```

    * *Expressions*. Evaluate to a resulting value

        >**NOTE**. Expressions make up most of the rest of the code written in Rust
        
        * *Examples*. 
            * `5 + 6` is an expression evaluating to the value `11` 
            * Calling a function is an expression
            * Calling a macro is an expression

**Scope block as expressions**. A new scope block created with curly brackets is an expression
* *Example*.

    ```rs
        let y = {
            let x = 3;
            x + 1
        };
    ```
    
    is a block evaluating to 4
    * *Explain*. The `x + 1` line does not have a semicolon at the end
* *Semicolons in expressions*. Expressions do not include ending semicolons
    
    $\to$ If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a value
    
    >**NOTE**. Keep this in mind as you explore function return values and expressions next

* *Difference from other languages*. In C and Ruby, where the assignment returns the value of the assignment
    
    $\to$ We can write `x = y = 6` and have both x and y have the value 6

### Functions with return values
**Function literals with return values**. We must declare their type after an arrow `->`
* *Return value in Rust*. The return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final expression in the block of the body of a function
* *Early return*. Use the `return` keyword and specifying a value
    
    >**NOTE**. Most functions return the last expression implicitly

* *Examples*.

    ```rs
    fn five() -> i32 {
        5
    }
    ```

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Rust’s memory safety principles**. In many low-level languages, index-out-of-range check is not done

$\to$ When providing an incorrect index, invalid memory can be accessed
