# Functional language features - Iterators and Closures
**Functional programming**. Programming in a functional style often includes using functions as values by 
* Passing them in arguments
* Returning them from other functions
* Assigning them to variables for later execution, etc.


**Closures and iterators**.
* *Closures*. A function-like construct we can store in a variable
* *Iterators*. A way of processing a series of elements

## Closures - Anonymous functions which can capture their environment
**Rustâ€™s closures**. Anonymous functions we can save in a variable, or pass as arguments to other functions
* *Using closures*. We can create the closure in one place, and then call the closure to evaluate it in a different context
* *Closure versus functions*. Unlike functions, closures can capture values from the scope, in which they are defined

### Creating an abstraction of behavior with closures
**Motivating problem**. Consider a very expensive function, e.g. `generate_exercise_workout_plan(intensity: u32, random_number: u32) -> u32`

$\to$ We want to call the function only when we need to, and only call it once
* *Naive implementation*.

    ```rs
    fn generate_workout(intensity: u32, random_number: u32) {
        if intensity < 25 {
            println!(
                "Today, do {} pushups!",
                simulated_expensive_calculation(intensity)
            );
            println!(
                "Next, do {} situps!",
                simulated_expensive_calculation(intensity)
            );
        } else {
            if random_number == 3 {
                println!("Take a break today! Remember to stay hydrated!");
            } else {
                println!(
                    "Today, run for {} minutes!",
                    simulated_expensive_calculation(intensity)
                );
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    where `simulated_expensive_calculation(intensity)` is a very expensive function
    * *Problem*. If the data science team decides that we need to make some changes to the way we call the `simulated_expensive_calculation` function in the future
        * *Consequence*. To simplify the update when those changes happen, we
            * Refactor this code so it calls the `simulated_expensive_calculation` function only once
            * Cut the place where the function is called twice unnecessarily, without adding other calls to that function in the process
                * *Explain*. We do not want to call it if the result is not needed
* *Refactoring using functions*.

    ```rs
    fn generate_workout(intensity: u32, random_number: u32) {
        let expensive_result = simulated_expensive_calculation(intensity);

        if intensity < 25 {
            println!("Today, do {} pushups!", expensive_result);
            println!("Next, do {} situps!", expensive_result);
        } else {
            if random_number == 3 {
                println!("Take a break today! Remember to stay hydrated!");
            } else {
                println!("Today, run for {} minutes!", expensive_result);
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    * *Pros*. All the calls to `simulated_expensive_calculation` are unified
        
        $\to$ This solves the problem of the first `if` block unnecessarily calling the function twice
    * *Cons*. We call the function and wait for the result in all cases, including the inner `if` block that does not use the result value
* *Refactoring using closures to store code*.

    ```rs
    fn generate_workout(intensity: u32, random_number: u32) {
        let expensive_closure = |num| { ... };

        if intensity < 25 {
            println!("Today, do {} pushups!", expensive_closure(intensity));
            println!("Next, do {} situps!", expensive_closure(intensity));
        } else {
            if random_number == 3 {
                println!("Take a break today! Remember to stay hydrated!");
            } else {
                println!(
                    "Today, run for {} minutes!",
                    expensive_closure(intensity)
                );
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    * *Idea*. Instead of always calling `simulated_expensive_calculation` function before the `if` blocks
        
        $\to$ We define a closure and store the closure in a variable, i.e.  `expensive_closure`, rather than storing the result of the function call
    * *Pros*. 
        * The definition of the expensive calculation is defined in only one place
        * The expensive code is only executed where we need the results.
    * *Cons*. The closure is called twice in the first `if` block
        * *Naive solution*. Create a variable to the `if` block to hold the result of calling the closure

            >**NOTE**. Closures provide us with another solution

**Closure**.
* *Closure definition*. 
    1. Start with a pair of vertical pipes `|`, inside which we specify the parameters to the closure
    2. Place curly brackets holding the body of the closure
        
        >**NOTE**. These are optional if the closure body is a single expression
    
    3. The end of the closure, after the curly brackets, needs a semicolon to complete the statement
        
        $\to$ The value returned from the closure body will be the value returned from the closure when it is called
* *Closure assignment to variable*. The `let` statement means `expensive_closure` contains the definition of an anonymous function

### Closure type inference and annotation
**Brief**. Closures do not require the annotation of parameters' type or the return value
* *Explain*. 
    * Type annotations are required on functions since they are part of an explicit interface exposed to our users
        
        $\to$ Defining this interface rigidly is important for ensuring the agreement on the parameters' and return types
    * Closures are not used in an exposed interface
        
        $\to$ They are stored in variables and used without naming them and exposing them to users of our library

**Usage of closures**. Closures are usually short and relevant only within a narrow context, rather than in any arbitrary scenario

$\to$ Within these limited contexts, the compiler is reliably able to infer the parameters' and return types

**Adding type annotations to closures**.

```rs
let expensive_closure = |num: u32| -> u32 {
    println!("calculating slowly...");
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
    num
};
```

* *Other closure syntaxes*.

    ```rs
    // Function of interest
    fn  add_one_v1   (x: u32) -> u32 { x + 1 }
    // Equivalent closures
    let add_one_v2 = |x: u32| -> u32 { x + 1 };
    let add_one_v3 = |x|             { x + 1 };
    let add_one_v4 = |x|               x + 1  ;
    ```

* *Type inference of closures*. Closure definitions will have one concrete type inferred for each of their parameters and for their return value
    * *Explain*. The type annotations of a closure will be inferred at the first invocation

        $\to$ Those types are then locked into the closure's definition
    * *Example*. The following code will not compile
    
        ```rs
        let example_closure = |x| x;
        let s = example_closure(String::from("hello"));
        let n = example_closure(5);
        ```

### Storing closures using generic parameters and the `Fn` traits
**Brief**. Consider the `generate_workout` function above and the refactor of that function using closures

$\to$ Our code was still calling the expensive calculation closure more times than it needed to

**Proposed solution**. Create a struct holding the closure and the resulting value of calling the closure
* *Idea*. Use memoization or lazy evaluation pattern
    * The struct will execute the closure only if we need the resulting value
    * The struct will cache the resulting value for later use
* *Closure type annotation*. To make a struct holding a closure
    
    $\to$ We need to specify the type of the closure
    * *Explain*. A struct definition needs to know the types of each of its fields
    * *Anonymous type of closures*. Each closure instance has its own unique anonymous type
        * *Explain*. Even if two closures have the same signature
            
            $\to$ Their types are considered different
        * *Solution*. Use generics and trait bounds

**`Fn` traits**. Provided by the standard library
* *`Fn` traits and closures*. All closures implement at least one of the traits `Fn`, `FnMut`, or `FnOnce`
    
    $\to$ We add types to the `Fn` trait bound to represent the parameters' return values' types of the closures
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    struct Cacher<T>
    where
        T: Fn(u32) -> u32,
    {
        calculation: T,
        value: Option<u32>,
    }
    ```

    >**NOTE**. Functions can implement all three of the `Fn` traits

    * *Needs for `Option<u32>` return type*. 
        1. Before we execute the closure, value will be `None`
        2. When code using a `Cacher` asks for the result of the closure
            
            $\to$ The Cacher will execute the closure, and store the result within a `Some` variant in the value field
        3. If the code asks for the result of the closure again
            
            $\to$ The Cacher will return the result held in the Some variant

* *Using `Cacher`*.

    ```rs
    impl<T> Cacher<T>
    where
        T: Fn(u32) -> u32,
    {
        fn new(calculation: T) -> Cacher<T> {
            Cacher {
                calculation,
                value: None,
            }
        }

        fn value(&mut self, arg: u32) -> u32 {
            match self.value {
                Some(v) => v,
                None => {
                    let v = (self.calculation)(arg);
                    self.value = Some(v);
                    v
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    * *Explain*. We want `Cacher` to manage the struct fieldsâ€™ values, rather than letting the calling code potentially change the values directly
        
        $\to$ The fields are private

**Refactored code using `Cacher`**.

```rs
fn generate_workout(intensity: u32, random_number: u32) {
    let mut expensive_result = Cacher::new(|num| {
        println!("calculating slowly...");
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
        num
    });

    if intensity < 25 {
        println!("Today, do {} pushups!", expensive_result.value(intensity));
        println!("Next, do {} situps!", expensive_result.value(intensity));
    } else {
        if random_number == 3 {
            println!("Take a break today! Remember to stay hydrated!");
        } else {
            println!(
                "Today, run for {} minutes!",
                expensive_result.value(intensity)
            );
        }
    }
}
```

### Limitations of the `Cacher` implementation
**Problems with `Cacher` implementation**.
* A `Cacher` instance assumes it will always get the same value for the parameter `arg` to the value method
    * *Solution*. Modify `Cacher` to hold a hash map rather than a single value
        * The keys of the hash map is the `arg` values passed in
        * The values of the hash map is the result of calling the closure on the corresponding key
    * *Consequence*. The `value` function 
        1. Look up the `arg` in the hash map
        2. Return the corresponding value if present
        3. If not present, the `Cacher` calls the closure and save the value in the hash map for later use
*  A `Cacher` only accepts closures taking one parameter of type `u32` and return a `u32`
    
    $\to$ We may want to cache the results of closures with other input and output types
    * *Solution*. Use more generic parameters to increase the flexibility of the `Cacher` functionality

### Capturing the environment with closures
**Closures and environment**. Closures can capture their environment and access variables from the scope, in which they are defined
* *Example*. Consider the following code

    ```rs
    fn main() {
        let x = 4;

        let equal_to_x = |z| z == x;

        let y = 4;

        assert!(equal_to_x(y));
    }
    ```

    $\to$ Even though `x` is not one of the parameters of `equal_to_x`, the closure is allowed to use the `x` variable defined in the same scope it is defined in

* *Drawback*. When a closure captures a value from its environment
    
    $\to$ It uses memory to store the values for use in the closure body
    * *Consequence*. This use of memory is overhead, when we want to execute code without capture its environment


**How closures capture values from their environment**. Use the three ways a function can take a parameter
* *How closures capture values from their environment*
    * *Option 1*. Taking ownership
    * *Option 2*. Borrowing mutably
    * *Option 3*. Borrowing immutably
* *`Fn` traits and environment capturing*. The three options are encoded in the three Fn traits as follows:
    * *`FnOnce`*. Consume the variables it captures from its closureâ€™s environment
        * *Consequence*. The closure takes ownership of the environment variables, and move them into the closure when it is defined
        * *Terminology*. `Once` means that the closure cannot take ownership of the same variables more than once 
            
            $\to$ The closure can be called only once
    * *`FnMut`*. Can change the environment, since it mutably borrows values
    * *`Fn`*. Borrow values from the environment immutably
* *`Fn` traits inference*. When creating a closure, Rust infers which trait to use based on how the closure uses the values from the environment
* *Forcing a closure to take ownership of environment variables*. Use the `move` keyword before the parameter list
    * *Usage*. Useful when passing a closure to a new thread, to move the data so it is owned by the new thread

    >**NOTE**. `move` closures may still implement `Fn` or `FnMut`, even though they capture variables by `move`
    >
    >* *Explain*. The traits implemented by a closure type are determined by what the closure does with captured values, not how it captures them, which is specified by `move`

    * *Example*.
    ```rs
    let equal_to_x = move |z| z == x;
    ```

>**NOTE**. Most of the time when specifying one of the `Fn` trait bounds, we can start with `Fn`
>
>$\to$ The compiler will tell if we need `FnMut` or `FnOnce` based on the closure body
