# Control flow
## `if` expressions
**`if` expressions**. All `if` expressions start with the keyword if, followed by a condition
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
    ```

* *Arms*. Blocks of code associated with the conditions in `if` expressions, i.e. like arms in `match` expressions
* *Needs for `bool` conditions*. The condition in each arm must be a `bool`
    * *Explain*. Unlike languages such as Ruby and JavaScript, Rust will not automatically try to convert non-Boolean types to a Boolean
        
        $\to$ We must be explicit and always provide `if` with a Boolean as its condition

**Using `if` in a `let` statement**. Since `if` is an expression

$\to$ We can use it on the right side of a let statement to assign the outcome to a variable
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };
    ```

## Repitition with loops
**Loops in Rust**. Rust has three kinds of loops, i.e. `loop`, `while`, and `for`

### Repeating code with `loop`
**`loop` keyword**. Tell Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    }
    ```

* *Breaking from a loop*. Use `break`
* *Skipping part of a loop*. Use `continue`

**Returning values from loops**. Add the value we want returned after the `break` expression you use to stop the loop

$\to$ The value will be returned out of the loop for later use
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;
        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };
    ```

### Conditional loops with `while`
**`while` loop**.
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    while number != 0 {
        println!("{}!", number);

        number -= 1;
    }
    ```

### Looping through a collection with `for`
**`for` loop**.
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a {
        println!("the value is: {}", element);
    }
    ```

    or

    ```rs
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{}!", number);
    }
    ```
