# Genertic types, traits, and lifetimes
**Generics**. Abstract stand-ins for concrete types or other properties
* *Idea*. When writing code, we can express the behavior of generics or how they relate to other generics without knowing what will be in their place when compiling and running the code

**Removing duplication by extracting a function**. Consider removing duplication without involving generic types by extracting a function
* *Example*. Consider finding the largest number in two different lists of numbers
    * *Naive code*.

        ```rs
        fn main() {
            let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

            let mut largest = number_list[0];

            for number in number_list {
                if number > largest {
                    largest = number;
                }
            }

            println!("The largest number is {}", largest);

            let number_list = vec![102, 34, 6000, 89, 54, 2, 43, 8];

            let mut largest = number_list[0];

            for number in number_list {
                if number > largest {
                    largest = number;
                }
            }

            println!("The largest number is {}", largest);
        }
        ```

    * *Removing duplication with functions*. We can create an abstraction by defining a function operating on any integer list
        
        $\to$ Our code becomes clearer and we can express the concept of finding the largest number in a list abstractly

        ```rs
        fn largest(list: &[i32]) -> i32 {
            let mut largest = list[0];

            for &item in list {
                if item > largest {
                    largest = item;
                }
            }

            largest
        }

        fn main() {
            let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

            let result = largest(&number_list);
            println!("The largest number is {}", result);

            let number_list = vec![102, 34, 6000, 89, 54, 2, 43, 8];

            let result = largest(&number_list);
            println!("The largest number is {}", result);
        }
        ```

* *Duplication removal procedure*.
    1. Identify duplicate code
    2. Extract the duplicate code into the body of the function
    3. Specify the inputs and return values of that code in the function signature
    4. Update the instances of duplicated code to call the function

## Generic data types
**Brief**. We can use generics to create definitions for items, e.g. function signatures or structs

$\to$ We can then use with many different concrete data types

### In function definitions
**Generic data types in function definitions**. We place the generics in the signature of the function, where we would usually specify the data types of the parameters and return value
* *Benefits*. 
    * Make our code more flexible
    * Provide more functionality to callers of our function
    * Prevent code duplication
* *Example*. Note that the following code will not compile yet, i.e. we will fix it later

    ```rs
    fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> T {
        let mut largest = list[0];

        for &item in list {
            if item > largest {
                largest = item;
            }
        }

        largest
    }

    fn main() {
        let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

        let result = largest(&number_list);
        println!("The largest number is {}", result);

        let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];

        let result = largest(&char_list);
        println!("The largest char is {}", result);
    }
    ```

### In struct definitions
**Generic types in struct definitions**. We can define structs to use a generic type parameter in one or more fields using the `<>` syntax, e.g.

```rs
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

fn main() {
    let integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
}
```

**Multiple generic types in struct definitions**.

```rs
struct Point<T, U> {
    x: T,
    y: U,
}

fn main() {
    let both_integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let both_float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
    let integer_and_float = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };
}
```

### In enum definitions
**Generic types in enum definitions**.

```rs
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}

enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

### In method definitions
**Generic types in method definitions**.

```rs
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl<T> Point<T> {
    fn x(&self) -> &T {
        &self.x
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };

    println!("p.x = {}", p.x());
}
```

* *Generic types in `impl`*. We have to declare `T` after impl to specify that we are implementing methods on the type `Point<T>`
    * *Explain*. By declaring `T` as a generic type after `impl`
        
        $\to$ Rust can identify that the type in the angle brackets in `Point` is a generic type, rather than a concrete type
    
**Generic types with constraints in method definitions**. Consider implementing methods only on `Point<f32>` rather than `Point<T>`

```rs
impl Point<f32> {
    fn distance_from_origin(&self) -> f32 {
        (self.x.powi(2) + self.y.powi(2)).sqrt()
    }
}
```

**Generic types in struct definitions and method definitions**. Generic type parameters in a struct definition are not always the same as those you use in that struct’s method signatures, e.g.

```rs
struct Point<X1, Y1> {
    x: X1,
    y: Y1,
}

impl<X1, Y1> Point<X1, Y1> {
    fn mixup<X2, Y2>(self, other: Point<X2, Y2>) -> Point<X1, Y2> {
        Point {
            x: self.x,
            y: other.y,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p1 = Point { x: 5, y: 10.4 };
    let p2 = Point { x: "Hello", y: 'c' };

    let p3 = p1.mixup(p2);

    println!("p3.x = {}, p3.y = {}", p3.x, p3.y);
}
```

### Performance of code using generics
**Brief**. Rust implements generics so that our code does not run any slower using generic types than it would with concrete types
* *Idea*. Rust performs monomorphization of the code using generics at compile time
    * *Monomorphization*. The process of turning generic code into specific code by filling in the concrete types used when compiled

        $\to$ The compiler does the opposite of the steps we used to create the generic function

## Traits - Defining shared behavior
**Trait**. Tell the Rust compiler about functionality a particular type has and can share with other types
* *Usages*. 
    * Define shared behavior in an abstract way
    * Specify that a generic type can be any type that has certain behavior
* *Analogy to OOP*. Traits are similar to interfaces in other languages

### Defining a trait
**Type’s behavior**. Consist of the methods we can call on that type

$\to$ Different types share the same behavior if we can call the same methods on all of those types
* *Trait*. A way to group method signatures to define a set of behaviors necessary to accomplish some purpose
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    pub trait Summary {
        fn summarize(&self) -> String;
    }
    ```

* *Number of methods in a trait*. A trait can have multiple methods in its body, i.e. the method signatures are listed one per line and each line ends in a semicolon

**Implementing a trait on a type**. We can implement a trait's method on our types
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    pub struct NewsArticle {
        pub headline: String,
        pub location: String,
        pub author: String,
        pub content: String,
    }

    impl Summary for NewsArticle {
        fn summarize(&self) -> String {
            format!("{}, by {} ({})", self.headline, self.author, self.location)
        }
    }

    pub struct Tweet {
        pub username: String,
        pub content: String,
        pub reply: bool,
        pub retweet: bool,
    }

    impl Summary for Tweet {
        fn summarize(&self) -> String {
            format!("{}: {}", self.username, self.content)
        }
    }
    ```

* *Implementing a trait on a type*. Similar to implementing regular methods
* *Using traits*. After implementing the trait on our types
    
    $\to$ The trait has to be brought into scope with the types, to get the additional trait methods, e.g.

    ```rs
    use aggregator::{Summary, Tweet};

    fn main() {
        let tweet = Tweet {
            username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
            content: String::from(
                "of course, as you probably already know, people",
            ),
            reply: false,
            retweet: false,
        };

        println!("1 new tweet: {}", tweet.summarize());
    }
    ```

    >**NOTE**. Other crates depending on the aggregator crate can also bring the `Summary` trait into scope to implement the trait on their own types
    
* *Restriction on trait implementations*. We can implement a trait on a type only if at least one of the trait or the type is local to our crate
    
    $\to$ We cannot implement external traits on external types
    * *Examples*.
        * *Example 1*. We can implement standard library traits, e.g. `Display`, on a custom type, e.g. `Tweet`, as part of our aggregator crate functionality
            * *Explain*. `Tweet` is local to our aggregator crate
        * *Example 2*. We can implement `Summary` on `Vec<T>` in our aggregator crate
            * *Example*. `Summary` is local to our aggregator crate
        * *Example 3*. We cannot implement the `Display` trait on `Vec<T>` within our aggregator crate
            * *Explain*. `Display` and `Vec<T>` are defined in the standard library, i.e. not local to our aggregator crate
    * *Purposes*. This restriction is part of a property of programs called coherence, i.e. the orphan rule
        * *Orphan rule*. Other people’s code cannot break our code and vice versa
            
            $\to$ Without the rule, two crates could implement the same trait for the same type

### Default implementations
**Default implementations**. Sometimes it is useful to have default behavior for some of the trait's methods

$\to$ As we implement the trait on a particular type, we can keep or override each method’s default behavior
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    pub trait Summary {
        fn summarize(&self) -> String {
            String::from("(Read more...)")
        }
    }
    ```

* *Using default implementations*. We specify an empty impl block with `impl Summary for NewsArticle {}`
    * *Overriding a default implementation*. The same as the syntax for implementing a trait method having no default implementation
* *Calling other methods from default method*. Default implementations can call other methods in the same trait, even if those other methods do not have a default implementation
    
    $\to$ A trait can provide useful functionality and only require implementors to specify a part of it
    * *Example*.

    ```rs
    pub trait Summary {
        fn summarize_author(&self) -> String;

        fn summarize(&self) -> String {
            format!("(Read more from {}...)", self.summarize_author())
        }
    }
    To use this version of Summary, we only need to define summarize_author when we implement the trait on a type:


    impl Summary for Tweet {
        fn summarize_author(&self) -> String {
            format!("@{}", self.username)
        }
    }
    ```

>**NOTE**. We cannot call the default implementation from an overriding implementation of that same method

### Traits as parameters
**Brief**. How to use traits to define functions that accept many different types?
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    pub fn notify(item: &impl Summary) {
        println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
    }
    ```

### Trait bound syntax
**Trait bound**.
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item: &T) {
        println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
    }
    ```

**Trait bound and trait as parameters**.
* *Trait as parameters*. Convenient and make for more concise code in simple cases
* *Trait bound*. Express more complexity in other cases
    * *Example*. 
        * We can have two parameters implementing `Summary`, using the `impl Trait` syntax is

            ```rs
            pub fn notify(item1: &impl Summary, item2: &impl Summary) {
            ```

            $\to$ If `item1` and `item2` have different types, using `impl Trait` is appropriate
        * If both parameters must have the same type, that is only possible to express using a trait bound, i.e.

            ```rs
            pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item1: &T, item2: &T) {
            ```

            * *Explain*. The generic type `T` specified as the type of `item1` and `item2` constrains the function that the concrete type of the value passed as an argument for `item1` and `item2` must be the same

#### Specifying multiple trait bounds with the `+` syntax
**Brief**. We can specify more than one trait bound using the `+` syntax, e.g.

```rs
pub fn notify(item: &(impl Summary + Display)) {
```

* *`+` syntax for trait bounds on generic types*.

    ```rs
    pub fn notify<T: Summary + Display>(item: &T) {
    ```

#### Clearer trait bounds with where clauses
**Drawbacks of using too many trait bounds**. Each generic has its own trait bounds

$\to$ Functions with multiple generic type parameters can contain lots of trait bound information between the function’s name and its parameter list
* *Consequence*. The function signature is hard to read
* *Solution*. Rust has an alternate syntax for specifying trait bounds inside a `where` clause after the function signature
    * *Example*. Instead of using

        ```rs
        fn some_function<T: Display + Clone, U: Clone + Debug>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32 {
        ```

        $\to$ We can use a `where` clause, i.e.

        ```rs
        fn some_function<T, U>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32
            where T: Display + Clone,
                U: Clone + Debug
        {
        ```

### Returning types implementing traits
**Returning types implementing traits**. We can use `impl Trait` to return a value of some type that implementing a trait, e.g.

```rs
fn returns_summarizable() -> impl Summary {
    Tweet {
        username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
        content: String::from(
            "of course, as you probably already know, people",
        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    }
}
```

* *Benefits*. Useful when using closures and iterators
    * *Explain*. Closures and iterators create types, which only the compiler knows, or types, which are very long to specify
        
        $\to$ `impl Trait` lets us concisely specify that a function returns some type that implements the `Iterator` trait without needing to write out a very long type
* *Restriction*. We can only use `impl Trait` when returning a single type

### Using trait bounds to conditionally implement methods
**Brief**. By using a trait bound with an `impl` block using generic type parameters

$\to$ We can implement methods conditionally for types implementing the specified traits
* *Example*. `Pair<T>` only implements `cmp_display` if its inner type `T` implements `PartialOrd` trait and `Display` trait

    ```rs
    use std::fmt::Display;

    struct Pair<T> {
        x: T,
        y: T,
    }

    impl<T> Pair<T> {
        fn new(x: T, y: T) -> Self {
            Self { x, y }
        }
    }

    impl<T: Display + PartialOrd> Pair<T> {
        fn cmp_display(&self) {
            if self.x >= self.y {
                println!("The largest member is x = {}", self.x);
            } else {
                println!("The largest member is y = {}", self.y);
            }
        }
    }
    ```

**Implement a trait for any type that implements another trait**. Implementations of a trait on any type that satisfies the trait bounds are called blanket implementations

$\to$ These are extensively used in the Rust standard library
* *Example*. The standard library implements the `ToString` trait on any type that implements the `Display` trait, i.e.

    ```rs
    impl<T: Display> ToString for T {
        // --snip--
    }
    ```

    $\to$ We can call `to_string` on any type implementing the `Display` trait

**Conclusion**. Traits and trait bounds let us 
* Write code using generic type parameters to reduce duplication
* Specify to the compiler that we want the generic type to have particular behavior
    
    $\to$ The compiler can then use the trait bound information to check that all the concrete types used with our code provide the correct behavior
    * *Error reporting*. In dynamically typed languages, we would get an error at runtime if we called a method on a type without the method
        
        $\to$ Rust moves these errors to compile time
    * *Consequences*. Improve performance without having to give up the flexibility of generics
        * We are forced to fix the problems before our code is even able to run
        * We do not have to check for behavior at runtime

## Validating references with lifetimes
**Reference lifetime**. Every reference in Rust has a lifetime, i.e. the scope for which that reference is valid
* *Lifetime inference*. Most of the time, lifetimes are implicit and inferred
* *Lifetime annotation*. We must annotate lifetimes when the lifetimes of references could be related in a few different ways
    
    $\to$ Rust requires us to annotate the relationships using generic lifetime parameters to ensure the actual references used at runtime will definitely be valid

### Preventing dangling references with lifetimes
**Brief**. The main aim of lifetimes is to prevent dangling references
* *Dangling reference*. The issue that a program to reference data other than the data it is intended to reference
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    {
        let r;                // ---------+-- 'a
                              //          |
        {                     //          |
            let x = 5;        // -+-- 'b  |
            r = &x;           //  |       |
        }                     // -+       |
                              //          |
        println!("r: {}", r); //          |
    }                         // ---------+
    ```
    
    * *Problem*. `x` does not live long enough, i.e. `x` will be out of scope when the inner scope ends on

### The borrow Checker
**Borrow checker**. The Rust compiler has a borrow checker that compares scopes to determine whether all borrows are valid
* *Example 1*. Consider the example above, where we annotated the lifetime of `r` with `'a` and the lifetime of `x` with `'b`
    
    $\to$ The inner `'b` block is much smaller than the outer `'a` lifetime block
    * *Scope comparison*. At compile time, Rust compares the size of the two lifetimes and sees that `r` has a lifetime of `'a` but that it refers to memory with a lifetime of `'b`
        
        $\to$ The program is rejected since `'b` is shorter than `'a`
        * *Explain*. The subject of the reference does not live as long as the reference
* *Example 2*. Consider the following code

    ```rs
    {
        let x = 5;            // ----------+-- 'b
                              //           |
        let r = &x;           // --+-- 'a  |
                              //   |       |
        println!("r: {}", r); //   |       |
                              // --+       |
    }                         // ----------+
    ```
    
    $\to$ `x` has the lifetime `'b`, which is larger than `'a`
    * *Consequence*. `r` can reference `x` since Rust knows that the reference in `r` will always be valid while `x` is valid

### Generic lifetimes in functions
**Motivating example**.
* *Erroneous code*.

    ```rs
    fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {
        if x.len() > y.len() {
            x
        } else {
            y
        }
    }
    ```
    * *Problem*. This function's return type contains a borrowed value, but the signature does not say whether it is borrowed from `x` or `y`
        * *Explain*. The `if` block in the body of this function returns a reference to `x` and the else block returns a reference to `y`
* *Correct code*.

    ```rs
    fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    ```

**Conclusion**. 
* *Observations*. When defining the function above
    * We do not know the concrete values that will be passed into the function
        
        $\to$ We do not know whether the `if` case or the `else` case will execute
    * We do not know the concrete lifetimes of the references that will be passed in
        
        $\to$ We cannot look at the scopes to determine whether the reference we return will always be valid
* *Consequence*. The borrow checker cannot determine this either, since it does not know how the lifetimes of `x` and `y` relate to the lifetime of the return value
* *Solution*. Add generic lifetime parameters to define the relationship between the references
    
    $\to$ The borrow checker can perform its analysis

### Lifetime annotation syntax
**Lifetime Annotation Syntax**. Functions can accept references with any lifetime by specifying a generic lifetime parameter

$\to$ This describes the relationships of the lifetimes of multiple references to each other without affecting the lifetimes

**Syntax**. Lifetime annotations have a slightly unusual syntax, i.e.
* *Naming syntax*.
    * The names of lifetime parameters must start with an apostrophe `'`
    * The names of lifetime parameters are usually all lowercase and very short, i.e. like generic types
        * *Common naming*. Most people use the name `'a`
* *Lifetime annotation location*. After the `&` of a reference, using a space to separate the annotation from the reference’s type
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    &i32        // a reference
    &'a i32     // a reference with an explicit lifetime
    &'a mut i32 // a mutable reference with an explicit lifetime
    ```

* *Interpretation*. One lifetime annotation by itself does not have much meaning
    * *Explain*. The annotations are meant to tell Rust how generic lifetime parameters of multiple references relate to each other
    * *Example*. Consider a function as given below
        * *Function parameters*. 
            * A parameter `first` referring to an `i32` with lifetime `'a`
            * A parameter `second` referring to an `i32` with lifetime `'a`
        * *Conclusion*. The references `first` and `second` must both live as long as the generic lifetime `'a`
    * *Conclusion*. By specifying the lifetime parameters in the function signature, we are not changing the lifetimes of any values passed in or returned
        
        $\to$ We are specifying that the borrow checker should reject any values, which do not adhere to these constraints

### Lifetime annotations in function signatures
**Example**.

```rs
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
```

**Lifetime of the returned reference**. The same as the smaller of the lifetimes of the references passed in

$\to$ These relationships are what we want Rust to use when analyzing this code

**Lifetime annotation in function signatures**. When annotating lifetimes in functions, the annotations go in the function signature

$\to$ The lifetime annotations become part of the contract of the function, i.e. like the types
* *Effects of lifetime annotations*. The analysis the Rust compiler can be simpler
    * *Explain*. 
        * If there is a problem with the way a function is annotated or the way it is called
            
            $\to$ The compiler errors can point to the part of our code and the constraints more precisely
        * If the Rust compiler made more inferences about what we intended the relationships of the lifetimes to be
            
            $\to$ The compiler might only be able to point to a use of our code many steps away from the cause of the problem

### Thinking in terms of lifetimes
**Brief**. The way in which we need to specify lifetime parameters depends on what our function is doing
* *Example*. If the function to always return the first parameter rather than some parameter conditionally on the inputs
    
    $\to$ We would not need to specify a lifetime on the other parameters, i.e.

    ```rs
    fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &str) -> &'a str {
        x
    }
    ```

**Lifetime parameter matching**. When returning a reference from a function

$\to$ The lifetime parameter for the return type needs to match the lifetime parameter for one of the parameters
* *Returning a reference to a function's local variable*. If the reference returned does not refer to one of the parameters
    
    $\to$ It must refer to a value created within this function
    * *Consequence*. This is a dangling reference, i.e. the value will go out of scope at the end of the function

        $\to$ The code will not compile

### Lifetime annotations in struct definitions
**References in struct**. Structs can hold references

$\to$ We need to add a lifetime annotation on every reference in the struct’s definition
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    struct ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
        part: &'a str,
    }

    fn main() {
        let novel = String::from("Call me Ishmael. Some years ago...");
        let first_sentence = novel.split('.').next().expect("Could not find a '.'");
        let i = ImportantExcerpt {
            part: first_sentence,
        };
    }
    ```

    * *Interpretation*. An instance of `ImportantExcerpt` cannot outlive the reference it holds in its part field

### Lifetime elision
**Motivating code**. The following code compiles without lifetime annotations

```rs
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}
```

* *Explain*. 
    * Due to historical reasons, i.e. in early versions (pre-1.0) of Rust
        
        $\to$ This code would not have compiled since every reference needed an explicit lifetime
        * *Consequence*. The function signature would have been written like this

            ```rs
            fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str {
            ```
    * After writing a lot of Rust code, the Rust team found that Rust programmers were entering the same lifetime annotations over and over in particular situations
        
        $\to$ These situations were predictable and followed a few deterministic patterns
        * *Consequence*. The developers programmed these patterns into the compiler’s code
            
            $\to$ The borrow checker could infer the lifetimes in these situations and would not need explicit annotations

>**NOTE**. This piece of Rust history is relevant since it is possible that more deterministic patterns will emerge and be added to the compiler
>
>$\to$ In the future, even fewer lifetime annotations might be required

**Lifetime elision rules**. The patterns programmed into Rust’s analysis of references

$\to$ These are not rules for programmers to follow
* *Explain*. They are a set of particular cases that the compiler will consider
    
    $\to$ If our code fits these cases, we do not need to write the lifetimes explicitly
* *Limitation*. The elision rules do not provide full inference
    * *Explain*. If Rust deterministically applies the rules but there is still ambiguity as to what lifetimes the references have
        
        $\to$ The compiler will not guess what the lifetime of the remaining references should be
        * *Consequence*. The compiler will give an error that we can resolve by adding the lifetime annotations

**Input and output lifetimes**.
* *Input lifetimes*. Lifetimes on function or method parameters
* *Output lifetimes*. Lifetimes on return values

**Lifetime inference rules**. The compiler uses three rules to figure out what lifetimes references have when there are not explicit annotations

$\to$ If the rules cannot help to figure out lifetimes, the compiler will stop with an error
* *Application scope*. These rules apply to `fn` definitions and `impl` blocks
* *Lifetime inference rules*.
    * Each parameter, which is a reference, gets its own lifetime parameter, i.e.
        * A function with one parameter gets one lifetime parameter
            
            ```rs
            fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32);
            ```
        
        * A function with two parameters gets two separate lifetime parameters
            
            ```rs
            fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32);
            ```
    * If there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters, i.e.
        
        ```rs
        fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32
        ```

    * If there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is `&self` or `&mut self`, i.e. a method
        
        $\to$ The lifetime of `self` is assigned to all output lifetime parameters
        * *Consequence*. Methods are much nicer to read and write since fewer symbols are necessary

### Lifetime annotations in method definitions
**Lifetime annotations in method definitions**. When implementing methods on a struct with lifetimes

$\to$ We use the same syntax as generic type parameters

>**NOTE**. We declare and use the lifetime parameters depends on whether they are related to the struct fields or the method parameters and return values

* *Lifetime names for struct fields*. Always need to be declared after the `impl` keyword and then used after the struct’s name
    * *Explain*. Those lifetimes are part of the struct’s type
* *Method signatures inside the `impl` block*. 
    * References may be tied to the lifetime of references in the struct’s fields, or they might be independent
    * The lifetime elision rules often make it so that lifetime annotations are not necessary in method signatures
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    impl<'a> ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
        fn level(&self) -> i32 {
            3
        }
    
        fn announce_and_return_part(&self, announcement: &str) -> &str {
            println!("Attention please: {}", announcement);
            self.part
        }
    }
    ```

### The static lifetime
**Static lifetime**. Indicate that the reference can live for the entire duration of the program
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    let s: &'static str = "I have a static lifetime.";
    ```

* *Cautions*. Before specifying `'static` as the lifetime for a reference
    
    $\to$ Think about whether the reference should actually lives the entire lifetime of the program
    * *Explain*. Most of the time, the problem results from attempting to create a dangling reference or a mismatch of the available lifetimes
        
        $\to$ The solution is fixing those problems, not specifying the `'static` lifetime

* *Usage*. Commonly used in error messages
