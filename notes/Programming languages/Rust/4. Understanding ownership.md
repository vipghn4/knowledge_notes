# Understanding ownership
**Brief**. Ownership is Rust’s most unique feature and has deep implications for the rest of the language
* *Benefits*. It enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector

## Ownership
**Ownership**. A set of rules governing how a Rust program manages memory
* *Memory management in other programming languages*. All programs have to manage the way they use a computer’s memory while running
    * Some languages have garbage collection that constantly looks for no-longer used memory as the program runs
    * In some languages, the programmer must explicitly allocate and free the memory
* *Rust's memory management approach*. Memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks
    
    $\to$ If any of the rules are violated, the program will not compile
    
    >**NOTE**. None of the features of ownership will slow down our program while it is running

### Ownership rules
**Ownership rules**.
* Each value in Rust has a variable called its owner
* There can only be one owner at a time
* When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped

### Variable scope
**Variable scope**. The range within a program, for which an item is valid
* *Key idea*. The relationship between scopes and when variables are valid is similar to that in other programming languages
    * When a variable comes into scope, it is valid
    * It remains valid until it goes out of scope

### The `String` type
**Brief**. We want to look at data that is stored on the heap and explore how Rust knows when to clean up that data

$\to$ The `String` type is a great example

**`String` type**.
* *Requirements for definition of `String` type*.
    * Strings are immutable
    * Not every string value can be known when we write our code
* *`String` memory allocation*. `String` manages data allocated on the heap, hence can store an unknown amount of text at compile time

### Memory and allocation
**String literal**. In the case of a string literal, we know the contents at compile time

$\to$ The text is hardcoded directly into the final executable
* *Pros*. String literals are fast and efficient
* *Cons*. These desired properties only come from the string literal’s immutability

**Dynamic-sized strings**. 
* *Problem*. We cannot put a blob of memory into the binary for each piece of text, whose size is unknown at compile time and whose size might change while running the program

    $\to$ We need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time, to hold the contents
    * *Consequences*.
        * The memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime
        * We need a way of returning this memory to the allocator when we are done with our `String`
* *Rust's memory management*. The memory is automatically returned once the variable owning it goes out of scope
    * *Example*.

        ```rs
        {
            let s = String::from("hello"); // s is valid from this point forward
            // do stuff with s
        }
        // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
        ```

    * *Workflow*. When a variable goes out of scope, Rust calls a special function, i.e. `drop`, for us
        * *`drop` function*. The author of `String` can put the code to return the memory
            
            $\to$ Rust calls drop automatically at the closing curly bracket
    * *Analogy in C++*. In C++, this pattern of deallocating resources at the end of an item’s lifetime is called Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)

#### Ways variables and data interact - Move
**Brief**. Multiple variables can interact with the same data in different ways in Rust

**Simplest interaction between scalar variables and data**. Consider the following code

```rs
let x = 5;
let y = x;
```

* *Dataflow*. Bind the value `5` to `x`, then make a copy of the value in `x` and bind it to `y`
    
    $\to$ We now have two variables, `x` and `y`, and both equal `5`

Now let’s look at the String version:

**Simplest interaction between strings**. Consider the following code

```rs
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;
```

* *String memory*. A String is made up of three parts
    * A pointer to the memory holding the string contents
    * A length, i.e. how much memory, in bytes, the contents of the String is currently using
    * A capacity, i.e. the total amount of memory, in bytes, that the String has received from the allocator
* *String storage location*. String's group of data is stored on the stack
* *String assignment*. When we assign `s1` to `s2`, the String data is copied
    * *Explain*. 
        * We copy the pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack
        * We do not copy the data on the heap that the pointer refers to

            $\to$ `s1` and `s2` pointing to the same value
    * *Motivation*. If Rust copied the heap data as well
        
        $\to$ The operation `s2 = s1` could be very expensive in terms of runtime performance if the data on the heap were large
    * *Analogy to deep copy*. The concept of copying the pointer, length, and capacity without copying the data probably sounds like making a shallow copy
        * *Move*. Additionally, Rust invalidates the first variable
            
            $\to$ Instead of calling it a shallow copy, it is known as a move, i.e. `s1` was moved into `s2`
        * *Benefits*. With only `s2` valid, when it goes out of scope
            
            $\to$ It alone will free the memory, and we are done
        * *Consequential design choice*. Rust will never automatically create deep copies of our data
            
            $\to$ Any automatic copying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms of runtime performance

**Double free error with strings**. When a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically calls the drop function and cleans up the heap memory for that variable
* *Problem*. When `s2` and `s1` go out of scope
    
    $\to$ They will both try to free the same memory, i.e. double free error
    * *Consequence*. Freeing memory twice can lead to memory corruption, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities
* *Solution*. To ensure memory safety, after the line let `s2 = s1`
    
    $\to$ Rust considers `s1` as no longer valid
    * *Consequence*. Rust does not need to free anything when `s1` goes out of scope

#### Ways variables and data interact - Clone
**`clone` method**. If we do want to deeply copy the heap data of the `String`, not just the stack data

$\to$ We can use a common method called `clone`
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1.clone();
    ```

* *Computational complexity*. When we see a call to `clone`, the code may be expensive

### Stack-only data - Copy
**`copy` method**. 
* *Deep copying fixed-size data types* Types such as integers have a known size at compile time, which are stored entirely on the stack
    
    $\to$ Copies of the actual values are quick to make
    * *Consequence*. We do not need to prevent `x` from being valid after the creation of `y`
        
        $\to$ There is no difference between deep and shallow copying, i.e. we call this `clone`
* *`Copy` trait*. A special annotation, which we can place on types that are stored on the stack
    * *Explain*. If a type implements the `Copy` trait
        
        $\to$ A variable is still valid after assignment to another variable
    * *Requirements*. 
        * We cannot annotate a type with `Copy` if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the `Drop` trait
        * If the type needs something special to happen when the value goes out of scope and we add the `Copy` annotation to that type
            
            $\to$ We will get a compile-time error
    * *Types implementing the `Copy` trait*. As a general rule
        * any group of simple scalar values can implement `Copy`
        * Nothing that requires allocation or is some form of resource can implement `Copy`

### Ownership and functions
**Ownership and functions**. The semantics for passing a value to a function are similar to those for assigning a value to a variable
* *Explain*. Passing a variable to a function will move or copy, just as assignment does

**Example**.

```rs
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still
                                    // use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
```

### Return Values and Scope
**Brief**. Returning values can also transfer ownership

**Example**.

```rs
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                        // value into s1

    let s2 = String::from("hello");     // s2 comes into scope

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 was moved, so nothing
  // happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -> String {             // gives_ownership will move its
                                             // return value into the function
                                             // that calls it

    let some_string = String::from("yours"); // some_string comes into scope

    some_string                              // some_string is returned and
                                             // moves out to the calling
                                             // function
}

// This function takes a String and returns one
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
                                                      // scope

    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}
```

**Key principles**. 
* Assigning a value to another variable moves it
* When a variable that includes data on the heap goes out of scope
    
    $\to$ The value will be cleaned up by drop unless ownership of the data has been moved to another variable

## References and borrowing
**Brief**. Rust has a feature for using a value without transferring ownership, called references

**Reference**. 
* *Reference and pointers*.
    * Like a pointer, a reference is an address we can follow to access data stored at that address, which is owned by some other variable 
    * Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type
* *Example*. References allow us to refer to some value without taking its ownership

    ```rs
    fn main() {
        let s1 = String::from("hello");
        let len = calculate_length(&s1);
        println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
    }

    fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
        s.len()
    }
    ```

    * *Explain*.
        * `&s1` syntax lets us create a reference that refers to the value of `s1` but does not own it
            
            $\to$ The value `&s1` points to will not be dropped when the reference stops being used
    * *Passing reference as parameters*. When functions have references as parameters instead of the actual values
        
        $\to$ We will not need to return the values to give back ownership, i.e. we never had ownership
* *Dereferencing*. The opposite of referencing by using `&` is dereferencing, which is accomplished with the dereference operator `*`

**Borrowing**. The action of creating a reference

### Mutable references
**Mutable references**.
* *Creation of mutable reference*.
    1. Change the variable to be `mut`
    2. Create a mutable reference with `&mut`, where we call the change function
    3. Update the function signature to accept a mutable reference with `&mut`
        
        $\to$ It is very clear that the change function will mutate the value it borrows
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    fn main() {
        let mut s = String::from("hello");
        change(&mut s);
    }

    fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
        some_string.push_str(", world");
    }
    ```

**Exclusive mutable reference**. Only one mutable reference to a particular piece of data can exist at a time
* *Example of violation*.

    ```rs
    let r1 = &mut s;
    let r2 = &mut s;
    ```

* *Purpose*. Prevent multiple mutable references to the same data at the same time
    
    $\to$ Rust can prevent data races at compile time
* *Data race*. Similar to a race condition and happens when these three behaviors occur
    * Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time
    * At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data
    * There is no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data
* *Issues with data races*. 
    * Data races cause undefined behavior
    * Data races can be difficult to diagnose and fix when we are trying to track them down at runtime
* *Conclusion*. Rust prevents this problem by refusing to compile code with data races

**Exclusive mutable-immutable reference**. We cannot have a mutable reference while having an immutable one to the same value
* *Explain*. Users of an immutable reference do not expect the value to suddenly change out from under them

>**NOTE**. Multiple immutable references are allowed

**Reference scope**. Start from where the reference is introduced and continues through the last time that reference is used
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
    // variables r1 and r2 will not be used after this point

    let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
    println!("{}", r3);
    ```

* *Non-lexical lifetimes (NLL)*. The ability of the compiler to tell that a reference is no longer being used at a point before the end of the scope

### Dangling references
**Dangling references**. A pointer referencing a location in memory that may have been given to someone else

$\to$ It is easy to erroneously create a dangling pointer by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to that memory
* *Prevention of dangling references*. In Rust, the compiler guarantees that references will never be dangling references
    * *Explain*. If you have a reference to some data
        
        $\to$ The compiler will ensure that the data will not go out of scope before the reference to the data does

## The slice type
**Slices**. Reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection, rather than the whole collection

$\to$ A slice is a kind of reference, so it does not have ownership

### String slices
**String slice**. A reference to part of a `String`
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    let s = String::from("hello world");
    let hello = &s[0..5];
    let world = &s[6..11];
    ```
* *String slice literal*. We create slices using a range within brackets by specifying `[starting_index..ending_index]`
    * `starting_index` is the first position in the slice
    * `ending_index` is one more than the last position in the slice
* *String slide data structure*. Internally, the slice data structure stores the starting position and the length of the slice
* *Rust’s range syntax*. `..` 
    * If we want to start at index zero, we can drop the value before the two periods
    * If our slice includes the last byte of the String, you can drop the trailing number

**String slice type**.  The type that signifies “string slice” is written as `&str`

#### String literals as slices
**String literals as slices**. Consider the following code

```rs
let s = "Hello, world!";
```

* *Type of `s`*. `&str`, i.e. it’s a slice pointing to that specific point of the binary
* *Consequence*. String literals are immutable, since `&str` is an immutable reference

### Other slices
**Brief**. There is a more general slice type

```rs
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let slice = &a[1..3];
assert_eq!(slice, &[2, 3]);
```

* *Slice type*. This slice has the type &[i32]
* *Mechanism*. It works the same way as string slices do, i.e. by storing a reference to the first element and a length
