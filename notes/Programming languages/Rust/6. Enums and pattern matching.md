# Enums and pattern matching
**Brief**. Enums, or enumerations, allows us to define a type by enumerating its possible variants
* *Enums in other programming languages*. Enums' capabilities differ in each language

## Defining an enum
**Enums**. A way of defining custom data types in a different way than structs
* *Example*. Consider IP addresses, we can use `enum` to express an IP address, which can be either IPv4 or IPv6

    ```rs
    enum IpAddrKind {
        V4,
        V6,
    }
    ```

* *Instance creation*. The variants of the enum are namespaced under its identifier, and we use a double colon to separate the two

    ```rs
    let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
    let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
    ```

* *Function declaration with `enum`*.

    ```rs
    fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}

    route(IpAddrKind::V4);
    route(IpAddrKind::V6);
    ```

### Enum values
**Storing data within an `enum`**. We can put data directly into each `enum` variant 
* *Example*. 

    ```rs
    enum IpAddr {
        V4(String),
        V6(String),
    }

    let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from("127.0.0.1"));
    let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
    ```

* *Variant name as `enum` constructor*. The name of each enum variant becomes a function that constructs an instance of the `enum`
    * *Example*. `IpAddr::V4()` is a function call taking a `String` argument and returning an instance of the `IpAddr` type
* *Variant associated data*. Each variant can have different types and amounts of associated data
    * *Example*.

        ```rs
        enum IpAddr {
            V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
            V6(String),
        }

        let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);
        let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
        ```

**Storing `struct` within an `enum`**. We can put any kind of data inside an enum variant, e.g. strings, numeric types, structs, or even enums etc.

```rs
struct Ipv4Addr {
    // --snip--
}

struct Ipv6Addr {
    // --snip--
}

enum IpAddr {
    V4(Ipv4Addr),
    V6(Ipv6Addr),
}
```


**Methods definition on `enum`s**. We can define methods on `enum`s, e.g.

    ```rs
    enum Message {
        Quit,
        Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
        Write(String),
        ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
    }

    impl Message {
        fn call(&self) {
            // method body would be defined here
        }
    }

    let m = Message::Write(String::from("hello"));
    m.call();
    ```

### The `Option` enum and its advantages over null values
**`Option` enum**. An `enum` defined by the standard library
* *Description*. `Option` encodes a value, which could be something or it could be nothing
    * *Example*.
        * If we request the first of a list containing items, we would get a value
        * If we request the first item of an empty list, we would get nothing 
* *Benefits*. Expressing `Option`'s concept in terms of the type system means the compiler can check whether we have handled all the cases we should be handling
    
    $\to$ This can prevent bugs, which are extremely common in other programming languages

**Null values in Rust**. Rust does not have the `null` feature that many other languages have
* *Motivation*. In his 2009 presentation “Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake,” Tony Hoare, the inventor of null, has this to say
    
    ```
    I call it my billion-dollar mistake. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object-oriented language. My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn’t resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.
    ```

    * *Conclusion*. If we try to use a null value as a not-null value
        
        $\to$ We will get an error of some kind
        * *Explain*. This null or not-null property is pervasive
            
            $\to$ it is extremely easy to make this kind of error
* *Implementation of null values in Rust*. Rust has have an enum to encode the concept of a value being present or absent
    
    $\to$ This enum is `Option<T>`, and it is defined by the standard library as follows

    ```rs
    enum Option<T> {
        None,
        Some(T),
    }
    ```

    * *Variants of `Option<T>`*. `Option<T>`'s variants are included in the prelude
        
        $\to$ We can use `Some` and `None` directly without the `Option::` prefix
        * `Option<T>` enum is a regular enum
        * `Some(T)` and `None` are still variants of `Option<T>`

**Generic type**. The `<T>` syntax is a feature of Rust, i.e. a generic type parameter
* *Explain*. `<T>` means 
    * The `Some` variant of the `Option` enum can hold one piece of data of any type
    * Each concrete type that gets used in place of `T` makes the overall `Option<T>` type a different type
* *Example*. 

    ```rs
    let some_number = Some(5);
    let some_string = Some("a string");
    let absent_number: Option<i32> = None;
    ```

    >**NOTE**. Rust can infer these types since we have specified a value inside the `Some` variant
    
    >**NOTE**. For absent_number, we need to annotate the overall `Option` type
    >
    >* *Explain*. The compiler cannot infer the type that the corresponding `Some` variant will hold by looking only at a `None` value


**`Some` and `None`**.
* *Description*.
    * When having a `Some` value, we know that a value is present and the value is held within the `Some`
    * When we have a `None` value, we do not have a valid value
* *`Option<T>` versus having null*. `Option<T>` is better than null
    * *Explain*. `Option<T>` and `T`, where `T` can be any type, are different types
        
        $\to$ The compiler will not let us use an `Option<T>` value as if it were definitely a valid value of type `T`
    * *Example*. The following code will not compile

        ```rs
        let x: i8 = 5;
        let y: Option<i8> = Some(5);

        let sum = x + y;
        ```

    * *Consequence*. We have to convert an `Option<T>` to a `T` before performing `T` operations with it
        
        $\to$ This helps catch one of the most common issues with null, i.e. assuming that something is not null when it actually is
* *Benefits*. Eliminating the risk of incorrectly assuming a not-null value helps us to be more confident in our code
    * *Explain*. 
        * To have a value that can possibly be null
            
            $\to$ We must explicitly opt in by making the type of that value `Option<T>`
        * Then, when using that value, we are required to explicitly handle the case when the value is null
        * Everywhere that a value has a type that is not an `Option<T>`
            
            $\to$ We can safely assume that the value is not null

**Getting `T` value from `Some(T)`**. The Option<T> enum has a large number of methods useful in a variety of situations
* *Using `Option<T>` value*. To use an `Option<T>` value, we want to have code to handle each variant
    
    $\to$ We can use the `match` expression, i.e. a control flow construct doing just this when used with enums
    * *Explain*. `match` expression will run different code depending on which variant of the enum it has
        
        $\to$ That code can use the data inside the matching value

## The `match` control flow construct
**`match` expression**. An extremely powerful control flow construct in Rust, which allows us to compare a value against a series of patterns and then execute code based on which pattern matches
* *Power of `match`*. Come from the expressiveness of the patterns and the fact that the compiler confirms that all possible cases are handled
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    enum Coin {
        Penny,
        Nickel,
        Dime,
        Quarter,
    }

    fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
        match coin {
            Coin::Penny => 1,
            Coin::Nickel => 5,
            Coin::Dime => 10,
            Coin::Quarter => 25,
        }
    }
    ```

* *Syntax*. 
    1. List the `match` keyword followed by an expression
          * *Difference from `if`'s expression*. 
              * With `if`, the expression needs to return a Boolean value
              * With `match`, the expression can return any type
    2. List the `match` arms
        * *`match` arm*. Have two parts, i.e. a pattern and some code, separated by the `=>` operator 
            
            $\to$ Each arm is separated from the next with a comma
* *Work flow*. When the `match` expression executes
    1. It compares the resulting value against the pattern of each arm, in order
    2. If a pattern matches the value, the code associated with that pattern is executed
    3. If that pattern does not match the value, execution continues to the next arm
* *`match` arm's code*. The code associated with each arm is an expression
    
    $\to$ The resulting value of the expression in the matching arm is the value returned for the entire `match` expression
    * *Multi-line arm code*. If we want to run multiple lines of code in a `match` arm
        
        $\to$ We must use curly brackets, e.g.

        ```rs
        fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
            match coin {
                Coin::Penny => {
                    println!("Lucky penny!");
                    1
                }
                Coin::Nickel => 5,
                Coin::Dime => 10,
                Coin::Quarter => 25,
            }
        }
        ```

### Patterns binding to values
**Brief**. An useful feature of match arms is that they can bind to the parts of the values that match the pattern

$\to$ This is how we can extract values out of enum variants
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    #[derive(Debug)] // so we can inspect the state in a minute
    enum UsState {
        Alabama,
        Alaska,
        // --snip--
    }

    enum Coin {
        Penny,
        Nickel,
        Dime,
        Quarter(UsState),
    }

    fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
        match coin {
            Coin::Penny => 1,
            Coin::Nickel => 5,
            Coin::Dime => 10,
            Coin::Quarter(state) => {
                println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
                25
            }
        }
    }
    ```

### Matching with `Option<T>`
**Brief**. We wanted to get the inner `T` value out of the `Some` case when using `Option<T>`

**Example**. Consider the following code

```rs
fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
    match x {
        None => None,
        Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
    }
}

let five = Some(5);
let six = plus_one(five);
let none = plus_one(None);
```

* *Work flow*. If we input `five` to `plus_one()` then `Some(5)` matches `Some(i)`
    1. The `i` binds to the value contained in `Some`, i.e. `i` takes the value `5`
    2. The code in the match arm is then executed

**Combining `match` and `enum`s**. Useful in many situations
* *Common example*. Match against an enum, bind a variable to the data inside, and then execute code based on it

### Matches are exhaustive
**Brief**. When using `match`, Rust knows whether we cover every possible case and even knows which pattern we forgot

**Exhaustive matches in Rust**. Matches in Rust are exhaustive
* *Explain*. We must exhaust every last possibility in order for the code to be valid

### Catch-all patterns and the `_` placeholder
**Brief**. Using enums, we can also take special actions for a few particular values, but for all other values take one default action
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    let dice_roll = 9;
    match dice_roll {
        3 => add_fancy_hat(),
        7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
        other => move_player(other),
    }

    fn add_fancy_hat() {}
    fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
    fn move_player(num_spaces: u8) {}
    ```

* *Catch-all pattern*. This catch-all pattern meets the requirement that match must be exhaustive
    
    >**NOTE**. We have to put the catch-all arm last since the patterns are evaluated in order
    
    >**NOTE**. Rust will warn us if we add arms after a catch-all, since those later arms would never match

* *`_` symbol*. Rust also has a pattern we can use when we do not want to use the value in the catch-all pattern, i.e. `_`
    * *`_` symbol*. A special pattern matching any value and does not bind to that value
        
        $\to$ This tells Rust we are not going to use the value, hence Rust will not warn us about an unused variable
    * *Example*.

        ```rs
        let dice_roll = 9;
        match dice_roll {
            3 => add_fancy_hat(),
            7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
            _ => reroll(),
        }

        fn add_fancy_hat() {}
        fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
        fn reroll() {}
        ```

## Concise control flow with `if let`
**`if let` syntax**. Allow combining `if` and `let` into a less verbose way to handle values, which match one pattern while ignoring the rest
* *Naive control flow using `match`*.

    ```rs
    let config_max = Some(3u8);
    match config_max {
        Some(max) => println!("The maximum is configured to be {}", max),
        _ => (),
    }
    ```

* *`if let` approach*.

    ```rs
    let config_max = Some(3u8);
    if let Some(max) = config_max {
        println!("The maximum is configured to be {}", max);
    }
    ```

* *Syntax*. `if let` takes a pattern and an expression separated by an equal sign
* *Work flow*. `if let` works the same way as a match, where the expression is given to the match and the pattern is its first arm
* *Pros and cons*. 
    * *Pros*. Using `if let` means less typing, less indentation, and less boilerplate code
    * *Cons*. We lose the exhaustive checking that `match` enforces

**`if let` and `else`**. We can include an `else` with an `if let

$\to$ The block of code that goes with the `else` is the same as the block of code that would go with the `_` case in the `match` expression that is equivalent to the `if let` and `else`
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    let mut count = 0;
    if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
        println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
    } else {
        count += 1;
    }
    ```
