# Error handling
**Types of errors in Rust**. Recoverable and unrecoverable errors
* *Recoverable errors*. We report the problem to the user and retry the operation
* *Unrecoverable errors*. Always symptoms of bugs, hence we immediately stop the program

**Exceptions in Rust**. Rust does not have exceptions

$\to$ It has the type `Result<T, E>` for recoverable errors and the `panic!` macro to stop execution when the program encounters an unrecoverable error

## Unrecoverable errors with `panic!`
**`panic!` macro**. When the `panic!` macro executes, THE program will print a failure message, unwind and clean up the stack, and then quit
* *Usage*. A panic is commonly invoked when a bug of some kind has been detected and it is not clear how to handle the problem at the time of writing the program
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    fn main() {
        panic!("crash and burn");
    }
    ```

**Unwinding the stack or aborting in response to a panic**.
* *Unwinding*. By default, when a panic occurs, the program starts unwinding
    * *Unwinding*. Rust walks back up the stack and cleans up the data from each function it encounters
    * *Drawback*. This walking back and cleanup is a lot of work
        
        $\to$ Rust allows us to choose the alternative of immediately aborting
* *Aborting*. End the program without cleaning up
    
    $\to$ Memory used by the program will need to be cleaned up by the OS
    * *Usage*. If we want the resulting binary as small as possible
        
        $\to$ We can switch from unwinding to aborting upon a panic by adding `panic = 'abort'` to the appropriate `[profile]` sections in the `Cargo.toml` file, i.e.

        ```yaml
        [profile.release]
        panic = 'abort'
        ```

### Using a `panic!` backtrace
**Brief**. We can use the backtrace of the functions the `panic!` call came from to figure out the part of our code that is causing the problem

**Backtrace**. A list of all the functions, which have been called to get to a certain point
* *Reading backtraces*. Start from the top and read until we see files we wrote
    
    $\to$ That is the spot where the problem originated

## Recoverable errors with `Result`
**`Result` enum**. 
* *Definition*. Have two variants, `Ok` and `Err`, i.e.

    ```rs
    enum Result<T, E> {
        Ok(T),
        Err(E),
    }
    ```

    * *`T` and `E` parameters*. Generic type parameters
        * `T` represents the type of the value, which will be returned in a success case within the `Ok` variant
        * `E` represents the type of the error that will be returned in a failure case within the `Err` variant
* *Usage*. We can use the `Result` type and the functions defined on it in many different situations where the successful value and error value we want to return may differ
    * *Explain*. `Result` has these generic type parameters

**Similarity to `Option`**. Like the `Option` enum, the `Result` enum and its variants have been brought into scope by the prelude

$\to$ We do not need to specify `Result::` before the `Ok` and `Err` variants in the `match` arms
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    let f = File::open("hello.txt");
    let f = match f {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(error) => panic!("Problem opening the file: {:?}", error),
    };
    ```

### Matching on different errors
**Example**.

```rs
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::ErrorKind;

fn main() {
    let f = File::open("hello.txt");

    let f = match f {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(error) => match error.kind() {
            ErrorKind::NotFound => match File::create("hello.txt") {
                Ok(fc) => fc,
                Err(e) => panic!("Problem creating the file: {:?}", e),
            },
            other_error => {
                panic!("Problem opening the file: {:?}", other_error)
            }
        },
    };
}
```

**Alternatives to using `match` with `Result<T, E>`**. The `match` expression is very useful but also very much a primitive

$\to$ We can use closures and `unwrap_or_else` method instead

* *Example*.

    ```rs
    use std::fs::File;
    use std::io::ErrorKind;

    fn main() {
        let f = File::open("hello.txt").unwrap_or_else(|error| {
            if error.kind() == ErrorKind::NotFound {
                File::create("hello.txt").unwrap_or_else(|error| {
                    panic!("Problem creating the file: {:?}", error);
                })
            } else {
                panic!("Problem opening the file: {:?}", error);
            }
        });
    }
    ```

### Shortcuts for panic on error: `unwrap` and `expect`
**Brief**. Using `match` works well enough, but it can be a bit verbose and does not always communicate intent well

$\to$ `Result<T, E>` type has many helper methods defined on it to do various, more specific tasks

**`unwrap` method**. A shortcut method implemented like the `match` expression
* *Idea*.
    * If the `Result` value is the `Ok` variant
        
        $\to$ `unwrap` will return the value inside the `Ok`
    * If the `Result` is the `Err` variant
        
        $\to$ `unwrap` will call the `panic!` macro
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    use std::fs::File;

    fn main() {
        let f = File::open("hello.txt").unwrap();
    }
    ```

**`expect` method**. Let us also choose the `panic!` error message
* *Purpose*. Using `expect` instead of `unwrap` and providing good error messages can convey your intent and make tracking down the source of a panic easier
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    use std::fs::File;

    fn main() {
        let f = File::open("hello.txt").expect("Failed to open hello.txt");
    }
    ```

### Propagating errors
**Propagating the error**. When a function’s implementation calls something that might fail

$\to$ We can return the error to the calling code for later handling
* *Explain*. We gives more control to the calling code, where there might be more information or logic dictating how the error should be handled
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    use std::fs::File;
    use std::io::{self, Read};

    fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
        let f = File::open("hello.txt");

        let mut f = match f {
            Ok(file) => file,
            Err(e) => return Err(e),
        };

        let mut s = String::new();

        match f.read_to_string(&mut s) {
            Ok(_) => Ok(s),
            Err(e) => Err(e),
        }
    }
    ```

>**NOTE**. Error propagation is common in Rust that Rust provides the question mark operator `?` to make this easier

### A shortcut for propagating errors - The `?` operator
**The `?` operator**. A shortcut for propagating errors
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    use std::fs::File;
    use std::io;
    use std::io::Read;

    fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
        let mut f = File::open("hello.txt")?;
        let mut s = String::new();
        f.read_to_string(&mut s)?;
        Ok(s)
    }
    ```

* *Idea*. The `?` placed after a `Result` value is defined to work as the `match` expressions defined to handle the `Result` values

    ```rs
    match f.read_to_string(&mut s) {
        Ok(_) => Ok(s),
        Err(e) => Err(e),
    }
    ```

    * If the value of the `Result` is an `Ok`
        
        $\to$ The value inside the `Ok` will be returned from the `?` expression, and the program will continue
    * If the value is an `Err`, the `Err` will be returned from the whole function
        
        $\to$ The error value gets propagated to the calling code
* *Difference from using `match`*.
    * Error values, which have the `?` operator called on them, go through the `from` function defined in the `From` trait in the standard library
        * *`from` function of `From` trait*. Used to convert errors from one type into another
        * *Explain*. When the `?` operator calls the `from` function
            
            $\to$ The error type received is converted into the error type defined in the return type of the current function
        * *Consequence*. This is useful when a function returns one error type to represent all the ways a function might fail, even if parts might fail for many different reasons
        * *Requirements*. There must be an `impl From<OtherError> for ReturnedError` to define the conversion in the trait’s `from` function
* *Benefits*. The `?` operator eliminates a lot of boilerplate and makes the function’s implementation simple

### Where the `?` operator can be used
**Usage of the `?` operator**. Used in functions, whose return type is compatible with the value the `?` is used on
* *Explain*. The `?` operator is defined to perform an early return of a value out of the function
* *Example*. The following code will not compile

    ```rs
    use std::fs::File;

    fn main() {
        let f = File::open("hello.txt")?;
    }
    ```

    * *Explain*. The `main` function has a return type incompatible with the type of the value we use `?` on
* *Solutions*.
    * *Option 1*. Change the return type of our function to be compatible with the value we are using the `?` operator on
    * *Option 2*. Use a match or one of the `Result<T, E>` methods to handle the `Result<T, E>` in some appropriate way

**Using `?` with `Option<T>`**. `?` can be used with `Option<T>` values

$\to$ As with using `?` on `Result`, we can only use `?` on `Option` in a function that returns an `Option`
* *Behavior of the `?` operator on an `Option<T>`*. Similar to the behavior when called on a `Result<T, E>`, i.e.
    * If the value is `None`, the `None` will be returned early from the function at that point
    * If the value is `Some`, the value inside the `Some` is the resulting value of the expression and the function continues
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    fn last_char_of_first_line(text: &str) -> Option<char> {
        text.lines().next()?.chars().last()
    }
    ```

**Mixing `?` with `Result` and `Option<T>`**. We can use the `?` operator on a `Result` in a function returning Result, and on an `Option` in a function returning `Option`

$\to$ However, we cannot mix and match
* *Explain*. The `?` operator will not automatically convert a `Result` to an `Option` or vice versa
* *Solution*. Use methods like the `ok` method on `Result` or the `ok_or` method on `Option` to do the conversion explicitly

**`main` function returning `Result`**. The `main` function is special since it is the entry and exit point of executable programs

$\to$ There are restrictions on what its return type can be for the programs to behave as expected
* *`main` function returning `Result`*. `main` can return a `Result<(), E>`
* *Example*.

    ```rs
    use std::error::Error;
    use std::fs::File;

    fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
        let f = File::open("hello.txt")?;

        Ok(())
    }
    ```

* *Idea*. When a `main` function returns a `Result<(), E>`, the executable will exit with a value of `0` if main returns `Ok(())`, otherwise with a nonzero value if main returns an `Err` value
    * *Analogy to C++*. Executables written in C return integers when they exit
        * Programs that exit successfully return the integer `0`
        * Programs that error return some integer other than `0`

## To `panic!` or not to `panic!`
**Brief**. How to decide when to call `panic!` and when to return `Result`
* *Idea*. When code panics, there is no way to recover

    >**NOTE**. We can call `panic!` for any error situation, whether there is a possible way to recover or not
    
    * By calling `panic!`, we are assuming that the situation is unrecoverable on behalf of the calling code
    * By returning a `Result` value, we give the calling code options, i.e.
        * The calling code may attempt to recover in an appropriate way for its situation, or
        * The calling code may decide that the `Err` is unrecoverable
            
            $\to$ It can call `panic!` and turn the recoverable error into an unrecoverable one
* *Conclusion*. Returning `Result` is a good default choice when defining a function that might fail

**When to use `panic!`**. When writing examples, prototype code, and tests

$\to$ It is more appropriate to write code that panics instead of returning a Result

### Examples, prototype code, and tests
**Brief**. 
* *Using `panic!` in examples*. When writing an example to illustrate some concept

    $\to$ Including robust error-handling code can make the example less clear
* *Using `panic!` in prototype code*. The `unwrap` and `expect` methods are very handy when prototyping, before we are ready to decide how to handle errors
    * *Explain*. They leave clear markers in the code for when we are ready to make our program more robust
* *Using `panic!` in tests*. If a method call fails in a test, the whole test should fail, even if that method is not the functionality under test
    * *Consequence*. Since `panic!` is how a test is marked as a failure
        
        $\to$ Calling `unwrap` or `expect` is exactly what should happen

### Cases we have more information than the compiler
It would also be appropriate to call unwrap when you have some other logic that ensures the Result will have an Ok value, but the logic isn’t something the compiler understands. You’ll still have a Result value that you need to handle: whatever operation you’re calling still has the possibility of failing in general, even though it’s logically impossible in your particular situation. If you can ensure by manually inspecting the code that you’ll never have an Err variant, it’s perfectly acceptable to call unwrap. Here’s an example:


    use std::net::IpAddr;

    let home: IpAddr = "127.0.0.1".parse().unwrap();
We’re creating an IpAddr instance by parsing a hardcoded string. We can see that 127.0.0.1 is a valid IP address, so it’s acceptable to use unwrap here. However, having a hardcoded, valid string doesn’t change the return type of the parse method: we still get a Result value, and the compiler will still make us handle the Result as if the Err variant is a possibility because the compiler isn’t smart enough to see that this string is always a valid IP address. If the IP address string came from a user rather than being hardcoded into the program and therefore did have a possibility of failure, we’d definitely want to handle the Result in a more robust way instead.

### Guidelines for error handling
It’s advisable to have your code panic when it’s possible that your code could end up in a bad state. In this context, a bad state is when some assumption, guarantee, contract, or invariant has been broken, such as when invalid values, contradictory values, or missing values are passed to your code—plus one or more of the following:

The bad state is something that is unexpected, as opposed to something that will likely happen occasionally, like a user entering data in the wrong format.
Your code after this point needs to rely on not being in this bad state, rather than checking for the problem at every step.
There’s not a good way to encode this information in the types you use. We’ll work through an example of what we mean in the “Encoding States and Behavior as Types” section of Chapter 17.
If someone calls your code and passes in values that don’t make sense, the best choice might be to call panic! and alert the person using your library to the bug in their code so they can fix it during development. Similarly, panic! is often appropriate if you’re calling external code that is out of your control and it returns an invalid state that you have no way of fixing.

However, when failure is expected, it’s more appropriate to return a Result than to make a panic! call. Examples include a parser being given malformed data or an HTTP request returning a status that indicates you have hit a rate limit. In these cases, returning a Result indicates that failure is an expected possibility that the calling code must decide how to handle.

When your code performs operations on values, your code should verify the values are valid first and panic if the values aren’t valid. This is mostly for safety reasons: attempting to operate on invalid data can expose your code to vulnerabilities. This is the main reason the standard library will call panic! if you attempt an out-of-bounds memory access: trying to access memory that doesn’t belong to the current data structure is a common security problem. Functions often have contracts: their behavior is only guaranteed if the inputs meet particular requirements. Panicking when the contract is violated makes sense because a contract violation always indicates a caller-side bug and it’s not a kind of error you want the calling code to have to explicitly handle. In fact, there’s no reasonable way for calling code to recover; the calling programmers need to fix the code. Contracts for a function, especially when a violation will cause a panic, should be explained in the API documentation for the function.

However, having lots of error checks in all of your functions would be verbose and annoying. Fortunately, you can use Rust’s type system (and thus the type checking done by the compiler) to do many of the checks for you. If your function has a particular type as a parameter, you can proceed with your code’s logic knowing that the compiler has already ensured you have a valid value. For example, if you have a type rather than an Option, your program expects to have something rather than nothing. Your code then doesn’t have to handle two cases for the Some and None variants: it will only have one case for definitely having a value. Code trying to pass nothing to your function won’t even compile, so your function doesn’t have to check for that case at runtime. Another example is using an unsigned integer type such as u32, which ensures the parameter is never negative.

### Creating custom types for validation
Let’s take the idea of using Rust’s type system to ensure we have a valid value one step further and look at creating a custom type for validation. Recall the guessing game in Chapter 2 in which our code asked the user to guess a number between 1 and 100. We never validated that the user’s guess was between those numbers before checking it against our secret number; we only validated that the guess was positive. In this case, the consequences were not very dire: our output of “Too high” or “Too low” would still be correct. But it would be a useful enhancement to guide the user toward valid guesses and have different behavior when a user guesses a number that’s out of range versus when a user types, for example, letters instead.

One way to do this would be to parse the guess as an i32 instead of only a u32 to allow potentially negative numbers, and then add a check for the number being in range, like so:


    loop {
        // --snip--

        let guess: i32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) => num,
            Err(_) => continue,
        };

        if guess < 1 || guess > 100 {
            println!("The secret number will be between 1 and 100.");
            continue;
        }

        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            // --snip--
    }
The if expression checks whether our value is out of range, tells the user about the problem, and calls continue to start the next iteration of the loop and ask for another guess. After the if expression, we can proceed with the comparisons between guess and the secret number knowing that guess is between 1 and 100.

However, this is not an ideal solution: if it was absolutely critical that the program only operated on values between 1 and 100, and it had many functions with this requirement, having a check like this in every function would be tedious (and might impact performance).

Instead, we can make a new type and put the validations in a function to create an instance of the type rather than repeating the validations everywhere. That way, it’s safe for functions to use the new type in their signatures and confidently use the values they receive. Listing 9-13 shows one way to define a Guess type that will only create an instance of Guess if the new function receives a value between 1 and 100.



pub struct Guess {
    value: i32,
}

impl Guess {
    pub fn new(value: i32) -> Guess {
        if value < 1 || value > 100 {
            panic!("Guess value must be between 1 and 100, got {}.", value);
        }

        Guess { value }
    }

    pub fn value(&self) -> i32 {
        self.value
    }
}
Listing 9-13: A Guess type that will only continue with values between 1 and 100

First, we define a struct named Guess that has a field named value that holds an i32. This is where the number will be stored.

Then we implement an associated function named new on Guess that creates instances of Guess values. The new function is defined to have one parameter named value of type i32 and to return a Guess. The code in the body of the new function tests value to make sure it’s between 1 and 100. If value doesn’t pass this test, we make a panic! call, which will alert the programmer who is writing the calling code that they have a bug they need to fix, because creating a Guess with a value outside this range would violate the contract that Guess::new is relying on. The conditions in which Guess::new might panic should be discussed in its public-facing API documentation; we’ll cover documentation conventions indicating the possibility of a panic! in the API documentation that you create in Chapter 14. If value does pass the test, we create a new Guess with its value field set to the value parameter and return the Guess.

Next, we implement a method named value that borrows self, doesn’t have any other parameters, and returns an i32. This kind of method is sometimes called a getter, because its purpose is to get some data from its fields and return it. This public method is necessary because the value field of the Guess struct is private. It’s important that the value field be private so code using the Guess struct is not allowed to set value directly: code outside the module must use the Guess::new function to create an instance of Guess, thereby ensuring there’s no way for a Guess to have a value that hasn’t been checked by the conditions in the Guess::new function.

A function that has a parameter or returns only numbers between 1 and 100 could then declare in its signature that it takes or returns a Guess rather than an i32 and wouldn’t need to do any additional checks in its body.
