# Good parts
**Proper ways to study a programming language**. Most programming languages contain good parts and bad parts

$\to$ It is better to use only the good parts and avoid the bad parts
* *Benefits*. By focusing on the good parts
    * We can reduce the learning time, increase robustness, and save some trees
    * We can avoid the need to unlearn the bad parts, which is very difficult
* *Question of interest*. How can you build something good out of bad parts
* *Standard-committee-based approach*. It is rarely possible for standards committees to remove imperfections from a language
    * *Explain*. Doing so would cause the breakage of all of the bad programs depending on those bad parts. 
    * *Consequence*. Committees are usually powerless to do anything except heap more features on top of the existing pile of imperfections
        
        $\to$ The new features do not always interact harmoniously, producing more bad parts
* *Self-based approach*. We have the power to define our own subset
    
    $\to$ We can write better programs by relying exclusively on the good parts

**Javascript**. A language with more than its share of bad parts
* *History*. 
    * JS went from non-existence to global adoption in an alarmingly short period of time
        
        $\to$ It never had an interval in the lab when it could be tried out and polished
    * JS went straight into Netscape Navigator 2 just as it was, and it was very rough
    * When Java applets failed, JS became the "Language of the Web" by default
        
        $\to$ JavaScript's popularity is almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language
* *Good parts of JS*. JavaScript has some extraordinarily good parts, i.e.
    * In JavaScript, there is a beautiful, elegant, highly expressive language that is buried under a steaming pile of good intentions and blunders
    * The best nature of JavaScript is so effectively hidden
        
        $\to$ For many years the prevailing opinion of JavaScript was that it was an unsightly, incompetent toy

## Pros and cons of JS
**Pros**. 
* JS's association with the browser makes it one of the most popular programming languages in the world

    $\to$ JavaScript is an important language because it is the language of the web browser
* It is possible to get work done with it without knowing much about
JS, or even knowing much about programming
    * *Explain*. JS is a language with enormous expressive power
        
        $\to$ It is even better when you know what we are doing

**Cons**. JS is one of the most despised programming languages in the world, i.e.
* The API of the browser, the Document Object Model (DOM) is quite awful, and JavaScript is unfairly blamed, i.e. 
    * The DOM would be painful to work with in any language
    * The DOM is poorly specified and inconsistently implemented
* JS is most despised because it is not some other language, i.e.
    * If we are good in some other language and we have to program in an environment that only supports JavaScript
        
        $\to$ We are forced to use JavaScript, and that is annoying
    * Most people in that situation do not even bother to learn JavaScript first

        $\to$ They are surprised when JavaScript turns out to have significant differences from the some other language they would rather be using, and that those differences matter

## Analyzing JS
**Brief**. JavaScript is built on some very good ideas and a few very bad ones
* *Good ideas*. Functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation
* *Bad ideas*. 
    * A programming model based on global variables

**Characteristics of JS**.
* JavaScript's functions are first class objects with mostly lexical scoping
* JavaScript is the first lambda language to go mainstream
* Deep down, JavaScript has more in common with Lisp and Scheme than with
Java, i.e. it is Lisp in C's clothing
    
    $\to$ This makes JavaScript a remarkably powerful language

**Strong typing and loose typing**. 
* *Strong typing*. The fashion in most programming languages today demands strong typing
    * *Explain*. Strong typing allows a compiler to detect a large class of errors at compile time
        
        $\to$ The sooner we can detect and repair errors, the less they cost us
    * *Drawbacks of strong typing*. 
        * Strong typing does not eliminate the need for careful testing
        * The sorts of errors that strong type checking finds are not the errors we worry about
* *Loose typing*. 
    * *Drawbacks*. JavaScript is a loosely typed language, hence JavaScript compilers are unable to detect type errors
        
        $\to$ This can be alarming to people who are coming to JavaScript from strongly typed languages
    * *Benefits*. Loose typing is liberating, i.e.
        * We do not need to form complex class hierarchies
        * We never have to cast or wrestle with the type system to get the behavior we want

**Object literal notation**. JavaScript has a very powerful object literal notation
* *Object literal notation in JS*. Objects can be created simply by listing their components
    
    $\to$ This inspires JSON, the popular data interchange format

**Prototypal inheritance** A controversial feature in JavaScript
* *Prototypal inheritance*. JavaScript has a class-free object system, in
which objects inherit properties directly from other objects
    
    $\to$ This is really powerful, but it is unfamiliar to classically trained programmers
    * *Consequence*. 
        * If we attempt to apply classical design patterns directly to JavaScript
            
            $\to$ We will be frustrated
        * If we learn to work with JavaScript's prototypal nature, our efforts will be rewarded

**Global variables**. A bad part of JS, i.e. JavaScript depends on global variables for linkage
* *Global variables in JS*. All of the top-level variables of all compilation units are tossed together in a common namespace, i.e. the global object
* *Drawback*. Global variables are evil, and in JavaScript they are
fundamental
* *Solution*. JavaScript gives us the tools to mitigate this problem
    
    $\to$ We will succeed in avoiding most of the bad parts

## A simple testing ground
**Requirements**. A web browser and any text editor

**Create testing ground**.
1. Make an HTML file with the following content

    ```js
    <html>
        <body>
            <pre>
                <script src="program.js">
                </script>
            </pre>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```
2. Make a file `program.js` in the same directory, e.g.

    ```js
    document.writeln('Hello, world!');
    ```

3. Open the HTML file in a browser to see the result


# Appendix
## Concepts
**First-class object**. 
* *Definition*. An entity within a programming language, which can
    * Appear in an expression
    * Be assigned to a variable
    * Be used as an argument
    * Be returned by a function call
* *"First class" meaning*. We can operate on them in the usual manner

**Lexical scoping (static scoping)**. A convention used with many programming languages, which sets the scope, i.e. range of functionality, of a variable so that it may only be called, i.e. referenced, from within the block of code, in which it is defined
* *Scope determination*. When the code is compiled

**Lambda language**. Any programming language supporting Lambda function
* *Lambda abstraction function*. Anonymous function, which is a function not bound to an identifier
* *Characteristics*. 
    * Passing a function to another function, where the function is treated as any other variable, is allowed
    * We can define lambda functions to be passed anonymously, or inline
* *Usage*. Required for immediate execution of a function, or for short term use, where there is no significance of giving name to function
* *Reference*. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3865335/what-is-a-lambda-language
