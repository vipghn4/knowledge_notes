# Objects
**Simple types and objects in JS**.
* *Simple types of JavaScript*. Numbers, strings, booleans, i.e. `true` and `false`, `null`, and `undefined`

    $\to$ All other values are objects
    * *Object-like simple types*. Numbers, strings, and booleans are object-like, i.e. they have methods, but they are immutable
* *Objects*.  Mutable keyed collections
    * *Examples*. Arrays are objects, functions are objects, regular expressions are objects, and objects are objects

**Object properties**. An object is a container of properties, where a property has a name and a value
* *Property name*. Can be any string, including the empty string
* *Property value*. Can be any JavaScript value except for `undefined`

**Class-free objects**. Objects in JavaScript are class-free, i.e. there is no constraint on the names of new properties or on the values of properties

$\to$ Objects are useful for collecting and organizing data
* *Nested objects*. Objects can contain other objects, so they can easily represent tree or graph structures

**Object prototype**. JavaScript includes a prototype linkage feature allowing one object to inherit the properties of another

$\to$ When used well, this can reduce object initialization time and memory consumption

## Object literals
**Object literals**. Provide a very convenient notation for creating new object values
* *Object literal syntax*. A pair of curly braces surrounding zero or more name/value pairs
    
    >**NOTE**. An object literal can appear anywhere an expression can appear

* *Property's name*. Can be any string, including the empty string
    * *Name quotes*. The quotes around a property's name in an object literal are optional if the name would be a legal JavaScript name and not a reserved word
* *Property's value*. Can be obtained from any expression, including another object literal
* *Key-value pairs separation*. Commas are used to separate the pairs

**Examples**.
* *Simple example*.

    ```js
    var empty_object = {};
    
    var stooge = {
    "first-name": "Jerome",
    "last-name": "Howard"
    };
    ```

* *Nested object*.

    ```js
    var flight = {
        airline: "Oceanic",
        number: 815,
        departure: {
            IATA: "SYD",
            time: "2004-09-22 14:55",
            city: "Sydney"
        },
        arrival: {
            IATA: "LAX",
            time: "2004-09-23 10:42",
            city: "Los Angeles"
        }
    };
    ```

## Retrieval
**Object's property value retrieval**. Values can be retrieved from an object by 
* *Option 1*. Wrapping a string expression in a `[ ]` suffix
* *Option 2*. If the string expression is a constant, and if it is a legal JavaScript name and not a reserved word
    
    $\to$ The `.` notation can be used instead
    
    >**NOTE**. The `.` notation is preferred because it is more compact and it reads better

* *Example*.

    ```js
    stooge["first-name"] // "Joe"
    flight.departure.IATA // "SYD"
    ```

**Retrieving nonexisting properties**. The undefined value is produced if an attempt is made to retrieve a nonexistent member, e.g.

```js
stooge["middle-name"] // undefined
flight.status // undefined
stooge["FIRST-NAME"] // undefined
```

* *Default value filling*. The `||` operator can be used to fill in default values

    ```js
    var middle = stooge["middle-name"] || "(none)";
    var status = flight.status || "unknown";
    ```

**Property value retrieval from `undefined`**. Attempting to retrieve values from `undefined` will throw a `TypeError` exception
* *Solution*. This can be guarded against with the `&&` operator, e.g.

    ```js
    flight.equipment // undefined
    flight.equipment.model // throw "TypeError"
    flight.equipment && flight.equipment.model // undefined
    ```

## Update
**Object property value update**. A value in an object can be updated by assignment
* If the property name already exists in the object, the property value is replaced, e.g.

    ```js
    stooge['first-name'] = 'Jerome';
    ```

* If the object does not already have that property name, the object is augmented

    ```js
    stooge['middle-name'] = 'Lester';
    stooge.nickname = 'Curly';
    flight.equipment = {
    model: 'Boeing 777'
    };
    flight.status = 'overdue';
    ```

## Reference
**Object reference**. Objects are passed around by reference

$\to$ They are never copied

## Prototype
**Object prototype**. Every object is linked to a prototype object, from which it can inherit properties
* *`Object.prototype`*. All objects created from object literals are linked to `Object.prototype`, an object that comes standard with JavaScript
* *Object creation via prototype*. When making a new object, you can select the object that should be its prototype

    $\to$ The mechanism provided by JavaScript to do this is messy and complex, but it can be significantly simplified

**Object creation via prototype** We will add a `beget` method to the `Object` function

$\to$ The beget method creates a new object that uses an old object as its prototype

```js
if (typeof Object.beget !== 'function') {
    Object.beget = function (o) {
        var F = function () {};
        F.prototype = o;
        return new F();
    };
}
var another_stooge = Object.beget(stooge);
```

**Object property value update and object prototype**. The prototype link has no effect on updating, i.e. when we make changes to an object

$\to$ The object's prototype is not touched
* *Example*.

    ```js
    another_stooge['first-name'] = 'Harry';
    another_stooge['middle-name'] = 'Moses';
    another_stooge.nickname = 'Moe';
    ```

**Object property value retrieval and object prototype**. The prototype link is used only in retrieval
* *Property value delegation*. 
    1. If we try to retrieve a property value from an object, and if the object lacks the property name

        $\to$ JavaScript attempts to retrieve the property value from the prototype object
    2. If that object is lacking the property, then it goes to its prototype, and so on
    3. The process repeats until finally bottoms out with `Object.prototype`
    4. If the desired property exists nowhere in the prototype chain
        
        $\to$ The result is the `undefined` value

**Dynamic prototype relationship** The prototype relationship is a dynamic relationship, i.e. if we add a new property to a prototype

$\to$ That property will immediately be visible in all of the objects that are based on that prototype
* *Example*.

    ```js
    stooge.profession = 'actor';
    another_stooge.profession // 'actor'
    ```

## Reflection
**Reflection**. An object can look at itself, listing and changing its properties and methods

$\to$ Reflection means examining the structure of a program and its data
* *Object property inspection*. It is easy to inspect an object to determine what properties it has by attempting to retrieve the properties and examining the values obtained

**`typeof` operator**. Can be very helpful in determining the type of a property, e.g.

```js
typeof flight.number // 'number'
typeof flight.status // 'string'
typeof flight.arrival // 'object'
typeof flight.manifest // 'undefined'
```

**Functional properties**. Some care must be taken because any property on the prototype chain can produce a value, even the property is of type `function`, e.g.

```js
typeof flight.toString // 'function'
typeof flight.constructor // 'function'
```

* *Solution 1*. Have our program look for and reject function values
    
    $\to$ Generally, when we are reflecting, i.e. we are interested in data, and so we should be aware that some values could be functions
* *Solution 2*. Use the `hasOwnProperty` method, which returns `true` if the object has a particular property
    
    >**NOTE**. The hasOwnProperty method does not look at the prototype chain

    * *Example*.

        ```js    
        flight.hasOwnProperty('number') // true
        flight.hasOwnProperty('constructor') // false
        ```

## Enumeration
**Object property enumeration**. The `for in` statement can loop over all of the property names in an object
* *Enumerated properties* The enumeration will include all of the properties, including functions and prototype properties we might not be interested in
    
    $\to$ It is necessary to filter out the values we do not want
* *Property enumeration order*. There is no guarantee on the order of the names, so be prepared for the names to appear in any order

**Property filter during enumeration**. The most common filters are the `hasOwnProperty` method and using `typeof` to exclude functions

**Enumeration order enforcement**. If we want to assure that the properties appear in a particular order

$\to$ It is best to avoid the for in statement entirely and make an array containing the names of the properties in the correct order

* *Example*.

    ```js
    var i;
    var properties = ['first-name', 'middle-name', 'last-name', 'profession'];
    for (i = 0; i < properties.length; i += 1) {
        document.writeln(properties[i] + ': ' + another_stooge[properties[i]]);
    }
    ```

## Delete
**`delete` operator**. Can be used to remove a property from an object, i.e. it will remove a property from the object if it has one
* *Deletion and prototyping* `delete` will not touch any of the objects in the prototype linkage

    $\to$ Removing a property from an object may allow a property from the prototype linkage to shine through
* *Example*.

    ```js
    another_stooge.nickname // 'Moe'
    // Remove nickname from another_stooge, revealing
    // the nickname of the prototype.
    delete another_stooge.nickname;
    another_stooge.nickname // 'Curly'
    ```

## Global abatement
**Global variables in JS**. JavaScript makes it easy to define global variables that can hold all of the assets of your application
* *Problem*. Global variables weaken the resiliency of programs and should be avoided

**Minimization of global variable usage**. An approach is to create a single global variable for your application

$\to$ That variable then becomes the container for your application
* *Example*.

    ```js
    var MYAPP = {};
    
    MYAPP.stooge = {
        "first-name": "Joe",
        "last-name": "Howard"
    };
    MYAPP.flight = {
        airline: "Oceanic",
        number: 815,
        departure: {
            IATA: "SYD",
            time: "2004-09-22 14:55",
            city: "Sydney"
        },
        arrival: {
            IATA: "LAX",
            time: "2004-09-23 10:42",
            city: "Los Angeles"
        }
    };
    ```

* *Benefits*. By reducing our global footprint to a single name
    * We significantly reduce the chance of bad interactions with other applications, widgets, or libraries
    * Our program also becomes easier to read because it is obvious that `MYAPP.stooge` refers to a top-level structure
