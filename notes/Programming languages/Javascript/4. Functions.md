# Functions
**Brief**. The best thing about JavaScript is its implementation of functions, i.e. it got almost everything right

>**NOTE**. As we should expect with JavaScript, it didn't get everything right

**Function**. Enclose a set of statements
* *Importance*. Functions are the fundamental modular unit of JavaScript, i.e.
    * They are used for code reuse, information hiding, and composition 
    * Functions are used to specify the behavior of objects
* *Function in computer science*. Generally, the craft of programming is the factoring of a set of requirements into a set of functions and data structures

## Function objects
**Function objects**. Functions in JavaScript are objects, which are collections of name/value pairs having a hidden link to a
prototype object
* *Prototyping*.
    * *Objects produced from object literals*. Linked to `Object.prototype`
    * *Function objects*. Linked to `Function.prototype`, which is itself linked to `Object.prototype`
* *Similarity to ordinary objects*. Since functions are objects, they can be used like any other value, i.e.
    * Functions can be stored in variables, objects, and arrays
    * Functions can be passed as arguments to functions
    * Functions can be returned from functions
    * Functions can have methods
* *Difference from ordinary objects*. Functions can be invoked

**Difference between `Function.prototype` and `Object.prototype`**.
* *Hidden properties*. Every function is created with two additional hidden properties
    * The function's context
    * The code implementing the function's behavior
* *`prototype` property*.  Every function object is also created with a `prototype` property
    * *`prototype` property*. An object with a `constructor` property whose value is the function
    
    >**NOTE**. This is distinct from the hidden link to `Function.prototype`

## Function literal
**Creation of function objects**. Function objects are created with function literals
* *Example*.

    ```js
    // Create a variable called add and store a function
    // in it that adds two numbers.
    var add = function (a, b) {
    return a + b;
    };
    ``` 

* *Function literal*. A function literal has four parts
    * The reserved word `function`
    * The optional function's name
        * *Usage*.
            * Used for recursive calls
            * Used by debuggers and development tools to identify the function
        * *Anonymous function*. A function, whose name is not given
    * The set of parameters of the function, wrapped in parentheses, within which is a set of zero or more parameter names, separated by commas
        * *Function parameters*. The parameter names will be defined as variables in the function
            
            $\to$ Unlike ordinary variables, instead of being initialized to undefined, they will be initialized to the arguments supplied when the function is invoked
    * A set of statements wrapped in curly braces, which are the body of the function
        
        $\to$ They are executed when the function is invoked

**Function literal location**. A function literal can appear anywhere that an expression can appear
* *Inner functions*. Functions can be defined inside of other functions
    * *Variable scope for inner functions*. An inner function of course has access to 
        * Its parameters and variables
        * The parameters and variables of the parent functions
* *Outer context linkage*. The function object created by a function literal contains a link to that outer context, i.e. closure
    
    $\to$ This is the source of enormous expressive power

## Invocation
**Function invocation**. Invoking a function suspends the execution of the current function, passing control and parameters to the new function
* *Hidden function parameters*. In addition to the declared parameters, 
    
    $\to$ Every function receives two additional parameters, i.e. `this` and `arguments`
    * *`this` parameter*. Very important in OOP, and its value is determined by the invocation pattern

**Function invocation patterns**. There are four patterns of invocation in JavaScript, which differ in how the bonus parameter this is initialized
* Method invocation pattern
* Function invocation pattern
* Constructor invocation pattern
* Apply invocation pattern

**Invocation operator**. A pair of parentheses following any expression, which produces a function value
* *Expression arguments*. The parentheses can contain zero or more expressions, separated by commas
    * *Expression argument*. Each expression produces one argument value
        
        $\to$ Each of the argument values will be assigned to the function's parameter names
* *Number of arguments*. There is no runtime error when the number of arguments and the number of parameters do not match
    * *Too many argument values*. The extra argument values will be ignored
    * *Too few argument values*. The `undefined` value will be substituted for the missing values
* *Argument types*. There is no type checking on the argument values, i.e. any type of value can be passed to any parameter

### Method invocation pattern
**Method**. When a function is stored as a property of an object, we call it a method
* *Object-bounding during method invocation*. When a method is invoked, `this` is bound to that object
* *Method invocation*. If an invocation expression contains a refinement, i.e. a `.` dot expression or `[subscript]` expression
    
    $\to$ It is invoked as a method, e.g.

    ```js
    var myObject = {
        value: 0;
        increment: function (inc) {
            this.value += typeof inc === 'number' ? inc : 1;
        }
    };
    
    myObject.increment( );
    document.writeln(myObject.value); // 1

    myObject.increment(2);
    document.writeln(myObject.value); // 3
    ```

* *`this` variable*. A method can use `this` to access the object to retrieve values from the object or modify the object
    * *The binding of `this` to the object*. Happen at invocation time
        
        $\to$ This very late binding makes functions that use this highly reusable
* *Public methods*. Methods getting their object context from `this`

### Function invocation pattern
**Function invocation**. When a function is not the property of an object, then it is invoked as a function, e.g.

```js
var sum = add(3, 4);
```

* *Object bounding during function invocation*. When a function is invoked with this pattern, `this` is bound to the global object
    * *Caution*. This was a mistake in the design of the language
        * *Explain*. If the language had been designed correctly, when the inner function is invoked

            $\to$ `this` should be bound to the `this` variable of the outer function
        * *Consequence*. A method cannot employ an inner function to help it do its work
            * *Explain*. The inner function does not share the method's access to the object as its `this` is bound to the wrong value
    * *Soltuion*. If the method defines a variable and assigns it the value of `this`
        
        $\to$ The inner function will have access to `this` through that variable
        * *Naming convention*. By convention, the name of that variable is `that`
* *Example*.

    ```js
    // Augment myObject with a double method.
    myObject.double = function ( ) {
        var that = this; // Workaround.
        var helper = function ( ) {
            that.value = add(that.value, that.value)
        };
        helper( ); // Invoke helper as a function.
    };

    // Invoke double as a method.
    myObject.double( );
    document.writeln(myObject.getValue( )); // 6
    ```

### Constructor invocation pattern
**Prototypal inheritance**. JavaScript is a prototypal inheritance language

$\to$ Objects can inherit properties directly from other objects, i.e. the language is class-free
* *Comparison to classical methods*. Most languages today are classical
    * Prototypal inheritance is powerfully expressive, but is not widely understood
        * *Consequence*. JavaScript itself is not confident in its prototypal nature
            
            $\to$ It offers an object-making syntax, which is reminiscent of the classical languages
    * Few classical programmers found prototypal inheritance to be acceptable, and classically inspired syntax obscures the language's true prototypal nature

**`new` prefix**. If a function is invoked with the new prefix

$\to$ A new object will be created with a hidden link to the value of the function's prototype member
* *Object bounding during function invocation*. `this` will be bound to the new object
* *`return` and `new`*. The `new` prefix changes the behavior of the `return` statement

    ```js
    // Create a constructor function called Quo.
    // It makes an object with a status property.
    var Quo = function (string) {
        this.status = string;
    };

    // Give all instances of Quo a public method
    // called get_status.
    Quo.prototype.get_status = function ( ) {
        return this.status;
    };
    
    // Make an instance of Quo.
    var myQuo = new Quo("confused");
    document.writeln(myQuo.get_status( )); // confused
    ```

**Constructors**. Functions intended to be used with the `new` prefix
* *Naming convention*. Constructors are kept in variables with a capitalized name
* *Constructor without `new`*. If a constructor is called without the new prefix

    $\to$ Very bad things can happen without a compile-time or runtime warning
    * *Consequence*. The capitalization convention is really important

>**NOTE**. Use of this style of constructor functions is not recommended

### Apply invocation pattern
**Brief**. Because JavaScript is a functional object-oriented language, functions can have methods

**`apply` method**. 
* *Usage*.
    * Used to construct an array of arguments to use to invoke a function
    * Used to choose the value of `this`
* *Method arguments*. The `apply` method takes two parameters
    * The value, which should be bound to `this`
    * An array of parameters
* *Example*.

    ```js
    // Make an array of 2 numbers and add them.
    var array = [3, 4];
    var sum = add.apply(null, array); // sum is 7
    // Make an object with a status member.
    var statusObject = {
        status: 'A-OK'
    };
    // statusObject does not inherit from Quo.prototype,
    // but we can invoke the get_status method on
    // statusObject even though statusObject does not have
    // a get_status method.
    var status = Quo.prototype.get_status.apply(statusObject);
    // status is 'A-OK'
    ```

## Concepts
**Closures in Javascript**. The combination of a function bundled together, i.e. enclosed, with references to its surrounding state, i.e. the lexical environment

$\to$ A closure gives us access to an outer function's scope from an inner function
* *Example*. The `displayName()` inner function is returned from the outer function before being executed

    ```js
    function makeFunc() {
        var name = 'Mozilla';
        function displayName() {
            alert(name);
        }
        return displayName;
    }

    var myFunc = makeFunc();
    myFunc();
    ```

**Adding new properties using `prototype`**. The issues around JS and inheritance may be complex
* *Scenario*. Consider the following code

    ```js
    function Klass() { }
    var obj1 = new Klass();
    var obj2 = new Klass();
    ```

* *Adding properties to objects and `Kclass`*.
    * If we add a property to `obj1`, that property exists only on `obj1`, likewise `obj2`
    * If we add a property to `Klass`, that property likewise exists only on Klass, i.e. the function object
        
        $\to$ It does not affect `obj1` and `obj2`
* *Adding properties to `Kclass.prototype`*.
    * If we add a property to `Klass.prototype`, that property will then be present on both `obj1`, `obj2`, and any future objects created via `new Klass`
    * If we then change the value of the property on the prototype
        
        $\to$ The changed value will be what you see on all those objects
* *Adding properties inside `Kclass`*. We can add code inside the body of `Klass` to add properties to `this`
    
    $\to$ That will then cause any future Klass objects to get those properties
    * *Difference from adding properties to `Kclass.prototype`*. Each object would have its own copy, i.e.
        * The copies can add up, memory-wise, especially when the properties are methods
        * The copies would not be affected by future changes to the body of `Klass`
