# The basics
**C++ as a compiled language**. For a program to run, its source text has to be processed by a compiler, producing object files, which are combined by a linker yielding an executable program

* *Portability of executable programs*. An executable program is created for a specific hardware / system combination

    $\to$ It is not portable

    >**NOTE**. When talking about portability of C++ programs, we usually mean portability of source code, i.e. sucessfully compiled and run on a variety of systems

**Types of entities in the ISO C++ standard**.
* *Core language features*. Built-in types, e.g. `char` and `int`, and loops, e.g. `for` and `while` statements
* *Standard-library components*. Containers, e.g. `vector` and `map`, and I/O operations, e.g. `<<` and `getline()`

**C++ as a statically typed language**. The type of every entity must be known to the compiler at its point of use
* *The type of an object*. Determine the set of operations applicable to it

## Types, variables, and arithmetic
**`auto` keyword**. We use `auto` where we do not have a specific reason to mention the type explicitly
* *"Specific reason"*.
    * The definition is in a large scope, where we want to make the type clearly visible to readers of our code
    * We want to be explicit about a variable's range or precision, e.g. `double` rather than `float`
* *Benefits*. Avoid redundancy and writing long type names

## Constants
**Notions of immutability in C++**.
* *`const`*. Mean roughly "I promise not to change this value"
    * *Usage*. Primarily to specify interfaces, so that data can be passed to functions without fear of it being modified
* *`constexpr`*. Mean roughly "To be evaluated at compile time", i.e. the evaluated value will be treated as constants during runtime
    * *Compile time function evaluation*.
        * For a function to be usable in a constant expression, i.e. in an expression which will be evaluated by the compiler

            $\to$ It must be defined `constexpr`
        * To be `constexpr`, a function must be sample, i.e. just a `return`-statement computing value

        >**NOTE**. `constexpr` function can be used for non-constant arguments, but when that is done, the result is not a constant expression

        >**NOTE**. We allow a `constexpr` function to be called with non-constant-expression arguments in contexts that do not require constant expressions
        >$\to$ We do not have to define essentially the same function twice

    * *Requirements*.
        * *`constexpr` for variable declaration*.
            * The variable type must be `LiteralType`
            * The variable must be intialized at the declaration
        * *`constexpr` for function*.
            * The function must not be a virtual function
            * The return type must be `LiteralType`
            * The types of the arguments must be `LiteralType`
    * *Usage*. Primarily to specify constants, to allow placement of data in memory where it is unlikely to be corrupted, and for performance
    * *Example*.
        * *Example 1*.

            ```c
            const int dmv = 17;
            int var = 17;
            constexpr double max1 = 1.4 * square(dmv); // OK if square(17) is a constant expression
            constexpr double max2 = 1.4 * square(var); // ERROR: var is not a constant expression
            ```

        * *Example 2*.

            ```c
            double sum(const vector<double>&); // sum will not modify its argument
            vector<double> v{1, 2, 3};
            const double s1 = sum(v); // OK: evaluated at runtime
            constexpr double s2 = sum(v); // ERROR: sum(v) not constant expression
            ```

## Modularity
### Separate compilation
**Separate compilation**. User code sees only declaration of types and functions used

$\to$ The definitions of those types and functions are in separate source files and compiled separately
* *Usage*. Organize a program into a set of semi-independent code fragments
* *Benefits*.
    * Minimize compilation times
    * Strictly enforce separation of logically distinct parts of a program

        $\to$ This minimizes the chance of errors
* *Library*. A separately compiled code fragments, e.g. functions

**Declarations**. We place the declarations, which specify the interface to a module, in a file with a name indicating its intended use
* *Header files*. The declarations would be placed in a header file, which will be included later in other files
* *Source files*. To help the compiler ensure consistency, the `.cpp` file providing the implementation of the interface will also include the header file providing the interface

**Compilation of included files**. Suppose there are two independent source files `code.cpp` and `Vector.cpp` both including `Vector.h`

$\to$ They can be compiled separately

    <figcaption>Two source files both include the same header file</figcaption>
</div>

* *Key idea*. Maximize modularity, represent that modularity logically through language features, then exploit the modularity physically through files for effective separate compilation

# Abstraction mechanisms
## Classes
**Class**. The central language feature of C++
* *Ideas*. Whenever our design for a program has a useful concept, idea, entity, etc.

    $\to$ We try to represent it as a class in the program so that the idea is there in the code

>**NOTE**. A program built out of a well chosen set of classes is far easier to understand and get right than one which builds everything directly in terms of the built-in types

>**NOTE**. Classes are often what libraries offer

**Important types of classes**. Concrete classes, abstract classes, and classes in class hierarchies

## Concrete types
**Concrete classes**. Behave just like built-in types
* *Example*. A complex number type, an infinite-precision integer, etc.
* *Formal definition*. A concrete class is a class having an implementation for all of its method

    $\to$ They cannot have any unimplemented methods

**Defining characteristic**. The representation of a concrete class is part of its definition
* *Example*. `vector`, i.e.
    * *Representation*. Only one or more pointers to more data stored elsewhere

>**NOTE**. The representation can be private and accessible only through the member functions, but it present
>$\to$ If the representation changes in any significant way, a user must recompile

**Examples**.
* Arithmetic types
* Containers, i.e. objects holding a collection of elements

# Appendix
## Cautions
* Template parameters are specified and evaluated at compilation time

## Concepts
**Aggregate type**.
* *Definition*. Any of the following
    * Array type
    * Class type, e.g. `struct` or `union`, which has
        * No private or protected non-static data members
        * No user-declared constructors
        * No user-provided constructors
        * No user-provided, inherited, or explicit constructors
        * No user-declared or inherited constructors
        * No `virtual`, `private`, or `protected` base classes
        * No virtual member functions
        * No default member initializers
* *Intuition*. An aggregate type groups together multiple fields of data

**Literal type**.
* *Defintion*. Any of the following
    * `void`
    * Scalar type
    * Reference type
    * An array of literal type
    * Class type, which has all of the following properties
        * Has a trivial destructor
        * Is either an aggregate type, or a type with at least one `constexpr` constructor that is not a copy or move constructor
    * All non-static data members and base classes are of non-volatile literal types
* *Definition*.
    * *Stroustrup's definition*. A class wih a `constexpr` constructor is called a literal type
    * *C++ 17 footnote's definition*. The term "literal" generally designates, in this International Standard, those tokens that are called "constants" in ISO C

**C++ project structure**.
* *`bin`*. The output executables, both for the app and for any tests and spikes

    >**NOTE**. Recently, executables are moved to `build` for easier manipulations (from Sinh)

* *`build`*. Container object files
* *`doc`*. Notes, configuration files, etc.
* *`include`*. Project header files, also all necessary third-party header files which do not exist under `/usr/local/include`
* *`lib`*. Any libs compiled by the project, and third-party or any needed in development

    >**NOTE**. Prior to development, third-party libraries get moved to `/usr/local/lib` where they belong, leaving the project clean enough to compile on Linux deployment servers

* *`src`*. Contain the source files
* *`test`*. Container the test codes

**How CMake find packages**. https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html

**Cross compilation**. The act of compiling code for one computer system, i.e. target system, on a different system, i.e. host system
* *Usecases*. When the target system is too small to host the compiler and all relevant files, e.g. embedded system, smartphone
