# Constraint satisfaction problems (CSP)
## Introduction
**Constraint satisfaction problems**: assign values to variables so that it matches some pre-defined constraints

**Binary CSP**: each constraint relates at most two variables
* Represent a binary CSP: use constraint graph
    * Nodes: each node represents a variable
    * Arcs: each arc show a constraints

**Varieties**:
* Varieties of variable types:
    * Discrete variables
    * Continuous variables
* Variety of constraints:
    * Unary: constraints involve a single variable
    * Binary: constraints involve a pair of variable
    * Higher-order: constraints involve 3 or more variables
    * Preferences (soft constraints): often represented by a cost for each variable assignment

**Applications**:
* Assignment problems
* Timetabling problems
* Hardware configuration
* Spreadsheets
* Transport scheduling

## Solve CSP
**Standard search formulation**:
* Formulation:
    * States: variables and values assigned so far
    * Initial states: the empty assignment
    * Action: choose any unassigned variable and assign to it a value that doesn't violate any constraint

    >**NOTE**: the algorithm fail if there's no legal assignment

    * Goal test: the current assignment is complete and satisfies all constraints
* Solution depth (in search tree): $n$ (fixed)

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ This is good
* Number of paths in search tree: $n! m^n$ where $m$ is the number of possible values for any variable and $n$ is the number of variables

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ This is too large

**Backtracking search**: 
* Motivation: if variable assignments are commutative

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ We only need to consider assignments to a single variable at each level of the tree (i.e. other assignments are fixed)
* Number of leaves: $m^n$
* Idea: use DFS for CSPs with single-variable assignments
* Pseudo-code:

    ```python
    RECURSIVE-BACKTRACKING(assignment, csp):
        if assignment is complete:
            return assignment
        var = SELECT-UNASSIGNED-VARIABLE(VARIABLE[csp], assignment, csp)
        for each value in ORDER-DOMAIN-VALUES(var, assignment, csp)
            if value is consistent with assignment given CONSTARINTS[csp]
                add {var = value} to assignment
                result = RECURSIVE-BACKTRACKING(assignment, csp)
                if result != failure:
                    return result
                remove {var = value} from assignment
        return failure
    ```

* Improvements:
    * Choose variable to assign next:  
        * Approach 1: minimum remaining value (MRV) heuristic: choose the most constrained variable (i.e. the variable with the fewest legal values)
        * Approach 2: choose the variable that imposes the most constraints on the remaining variables
    * Choose the order of values to be tried: choose the least constraining value (i.e. the value that rules out the fewest values in the remaining variables)
    * Detect failure assignment in advance

**Local search**: the same as local search (operation research)
