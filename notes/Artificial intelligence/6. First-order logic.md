# Introduction
**First-order logic**: a collection of formal systems used in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science
* Other name: predicate logic, first-order predicate calculus
* Idea: use quantified variables over non-logical objects and allow the use of sentences that contain variables
    * Example: "There exists $x$ that $x$ is Socrates and $x$ is a man" instead of "Socrates is a man"
* Foundation of first-order logic: propositional logic

# Substitution
## Substitution
**Substitution**: 
* Idea: the same as variable assignment

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ This allow us to make use of variables
* Definition: a finite set of specifications of the form $x/t$ where $x$ is a term and $v$ is a variable
    * Notation: $\theta = \{x_1/t_1, ..., x_n/t_n\}$ is a substitution 
        * $x_i$ are different variables 
        * $t_i$ are expressions not containing $x_i$
* Application of substitution: substitute $\theta$ in $G$ obtain $G_\theta$
    * Example: $G = P(x, y, f(a, x))$ and $\theta = [x/b, y/g(z)]$
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow G_\theta = P(b, g(z), f(a, b))$
* Constraints:
    * A constant $a$ cannot be substituted by a variable $x$
    * A variable $x$ cannot be substituted by a expression containing $x$

**Substitution rule**: $\frac{\forall x, G}{G_{[x|t]}}$

## Unification
**Motivation**: a tool for employing resolution for first-order logic

**Unification**: the process of making two terms $C$ and $D$ with variables equal via some substitution $\theta$
* Unify: $C$ and $D unify if there's some substitution $\theta$ of terms for variables that makes them (i.e. $C$ and $D$) equal
* Unifier of $C$ and $D$: $\theta$
* Unifiability: $C$ and $D$ are unifiable

**Most general unifier**: a substitution $\theta$ is more general than a substitution $\mu$ if and only if, there exists a substitution $\lambda$ that

$\hspace{3.0cm} G_\mu = G_{\theta \lambda}$

**Composition of substitutions**:
* Assumptions:
    * $\theta = \{x_1/t_1, ..., x_n/t_n\}$ is a substitution
    * $\eta = \{y_1/s_1, ..., y_m/s_m\}$ is a substitution
* Conclusion:
    * The composition of $\theta$ and $\eta$: the substitution $\theta \eta$ so that $E_{\theta \eta} = (E_\theta)_\eta$ $\forall E$
    
    >**NOTE**: substitution composition occurs from left to right (i.e. $\theta, \eta$ means that $\theta$ should be applied first, and then $\eta$)

* Combine substitution:
    * Step 1: remove all $y_i$ where $y_i$ contains some $x_k$
    * Step 2: $\theta \eta = \{(x_1/t_1)_\eta, ..., (x_n/t_n)_\eta, y_1/s_1, ..., y_m/s_m\}$

## Unification algorithms
**Task**: determine whether $C$ and $D$ are unifiable

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ If yes, unify them using the most general unifier

**Determine the difference between two expressions $C$ and $D$**:
* Idea: read $C$ and $D$ from left to right until we meet two different symbols
* Example: the difference between $P(x, f(a, u))$ and $P(x, f(a, g(b)))$ is the tuple $(u, g(b))$

**Most General Unification algorithm**:

```python
INITIALIZE():
    theta = [] # empty substitution

UNIFY(E, F):
    dif = FIND-DIFFERENCE(E, F)
    if dif.size == 0:
        return True
    for (x, t) in dif:
        if not t.contain(x):
            E = E[x/t]
            F = F[x/t]
            theta = COMPOSE(theta, [x/t])
            return UNIFY(E, F)
    return False
```
