# Search problem
## Search problem
**Search problem components**:
* Initial state
* Actions: actions which can be taken at each search step
* Transition model: the results of each action which causes transitions of states
* Goal state
* Path cost

**State space of the problem**: the set of all states reachable from initial state by any sequence of actions

>**NOTE**: state space is defined by the initial state, actions and transition model

* Represent the state space: use directed graph where nodes are states and edges are actions

**Optimal solution**: the sequence of actions which gives the lowest path cost of reaching the goal state from the initial state
* Find optimal solution:
    * Why not Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm ?: 
        * Complexity: $O(E + V \log V)$ where $V$ is the size of state space
        
        $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ The state space may be large and causes bad complexity
    * Solution: use searching algorithms (see below)

## Searching algorithms
**Searching algorithms**:
* Basic idea:
    * Initialization: 
        * Begin at the start state
        * Expand the start state my making a list of all possible successor states
        * Initialize a "frontier" (i.e. a list of reachable unexpanded states)
    * Iterations:
        * Pick a state from "frontier" 
        * Expand to all nodes, reachable from the chosen state, which haven't been visited
        
        >**NOTE**: try to expand as few states as possible
        
        * Update the cost for all nodes, reachable from the chosen state, which haven't been visited
    * Termination: when the algorithm reaches a goal state
* Represent the searching process: use search tree
    * Root node: represent the start state
    * Children of a node: represent the successor states of the state represented by the node
    * A path through the tree: represent a sequence of actions
    
    >**NOTE** a solution is a path ending in the goal state

**Search algorithm with strategy (general search algorithm)**:
* Strategy: defined by the order in which the nodes are expanded
    * Uninformed search (blind search): when we have no prior knowledge about the problem
        * Solution: brute-force-like approaches
    * Informed search (heuristic search): when we have prior knowledge about the problem
        * Solution: derive a loss function which reflects the prior knowledge
    * Optimal search
    * Adversarial search: when the algorithm has some opponent to fight against
* Pseudo code:

    ```python
    GENERAL-SEARCH(strategy):
        initialize the search tree using the initial state
        while true:
            if no candidate for expansion:
                return failure
            choose a leaf node for expansion according to strategy
            if the node contains a goal state:
                return solution
            else:
                expand the node and add the resulting nodes to the search tree
                update the cost for visited nodes reachable from the chosen node
    ```

## Problem solving and evaluation
**Problem-solving procedure**:
* Step 1: goal formulation
* Step 2: problem formulation
* Step 3: search for solution

**Evaluation for search strategies**:
* Completeness: if a solution exists, it must be found by the algorithm
* Time complexity
* Space complexity
* Optimality: the cost of the proposed path from the start state to the goal state must be minimized
