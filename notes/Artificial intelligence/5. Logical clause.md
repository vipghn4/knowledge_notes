# Knowledge and inference
## Data, information and knowledge
**Data**: numbers, characters, images, etc. which can be processed by computers

**Information**: everything which can be aware directly or indirectly by human

**Knowledge**: data, which are ordered or collected according to some relationship, may contain information

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ The clearly defined relationships are "knowledge"

* Types of knowledge:
    * Events knowledge: knowledge about some event or definition
    * Procedure knowledge: knowledge about methods, algorithms or procedures
    * Description knowledge: knowledge describing objects, events, problems, etc.
    * Heuristic knowledge: knowledge obtained via experiences, observations, etc.
* Knowledge interpretation: use propositional logic
    * Syntax and semantic
    * Inference rules
    * Algorithms on propositional logic

## Data representation - logical clause
**Represent knowledge**:
* Syntax: 
    * A set of symbols 
    * Syntax rules: principles for connecting those symbols to construct an expression (or formula)
* Semantic: allow us to determine the meaning of expressions
* Reasoning mechanism:
    * Automated reasoning: a process of computation
        * Input: a set of formulas
        * Output: a new formula (describing new knowledge)
    * Rule of inference: allow us to infer a formula from a set of formulas

**Clause (logic)**:
* Notations:
    * Logical constants: True and False
    * Symbols (variables): use Latin characters
    * Logical connection: $\land$, $\lor$, $\lnot$, $\implies$ and $\iff$
* Rules for expression construction:
    * Each logical variable is a formula
    * If $A$ and $B$ are formulas then the following are formulas
        * $A \land B$
        * $A \lor B$
        * $\lnot B$
        * $A \implies B$
        * $A \iff B$

**Semantic of a logical clause**: allow us to determine the meaning of that clause
* Interpretation: an assignment of a logical variable
* Types of formulas:
    * Satisfiable: formulas which is True in some interpretation
    * Valid (or tautology): formulas which is True in all interpretation
    * Unsatisfiable: formulas which is False in all interpretation
* Model of a formula: an interpretation where the formula is True

**Equivalence formulas**: $A$ and $B$ are equivalent if they have the same value in every interpretation

## Equivalent transformation
**Interpretation**: 
* $\lor$ can be understood as addition
* $\land$ can be understood as multiplication

**De Morgan rule**: 
* $\lnot (A \lor B) = (\lnot A) \land (\lnot B)$
* $\lnot (A \land B) = (\lnot A) \lor (\lnot B)$

**Combination**: 
* $(A \lor B) \lor C = A \lor (B \lor C)$
* $(A \land B) \land C = A \land (B \land C)$

**Distribution**:
* $A \land (B \lor C) = (A \land B) \lor (A \land C)$
* $A \lor (B \land C) = (A \lor B) \land (A \lor C)$

## Inference rules
**Modus Ponens rule**: $\frac{\alpha \implies \beta, \alpha}{\beta}$

**Module Tollens rule**: $\frac{\alpha \implies \beta, \lnot \beta}{\lnot \alpha}$

**Resolution rule**: $\frac{\alpha \lor \beta, \gamma \lor \lnot \beta}{\alpha \lor \gamma}$

**Other rules**:
* $\frac{\alpha \implies \beta, \beta \implies \gamma}{\alpha \implies \gamma}$
* $\frac{\alpha_1 \land ... \land \alpha_m}{\alpha_i}$ where $i \in [1, m]$
* $\frac{\alpha_i}{\alpha_1 \lor ... \lor \alpha_m}$ where $i \in [1, m]$

## Logical inference
**Normal form**:
* Horn normal form: $(q_1 \land ... \land q_n) \implies c$
* Disjunctive normal form: OR of ANDs (i.e. sum of products)
* Conjunctive normal form: AND of ORs (i.e. product of sums)
    * Convert to conjunctive normal form:
        * Step 1: replace $A \implies B$ by $\lnot A \lor B$
        * Step 2: move $\lnot$ from each clause to its inner atom variables
        * Step 3: apply the rule $A \lor (B \land C) = (A \lor B) \land (A \lor C)$

**Logical consequence**: $H$ is a logical consequence of $G = \{G_1, ..., G_m\}$ if we can obtain $H$ from $G$

**Inference rule**: consists of two parts - conditions and conclusion
* Represent inference rules: $\frac{\text{conditions}}{\text{conclusion}}$

**Robinson resolution algorithm**:
* Resolution (logical): $\frac{a \lor c, b \lor \lnot c}{a \lor b}$
  * Explain: since both $c$ and $\lnot c$ appears in the numerator
  
  $\hspace{1.0cm}$ Either $a$ or $b$ must be True, thus $a \lor b$ is True
* Target: infer a formula from the given set of formulas
* Idea: prove by contradiction

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ If we want to obtain $A$ from $G$, we should prove that $G$ and $\lnot A$ implies empty formula (i.e. contradiction)
* Pseudo-code:

    ```python
    ROBINSON(G, H):
        # G is the set of input formulas
        # H is the formula to be proven
        G.append(not(H))
        convert G into a conjunctive normal form with the conjuncts viewed as elements in G
        repeat:
            choose A, B from G
            if A, B is resolvable:
                res = resolution(A, B)
                remove A, B
                if res is the empty clause:
                    return H is true
                add res to G
        until not able to generate new formula
        return H is false
    ```

* Explain:
    * If we come up with empty formula (i.e. $\frac{H, \lnot H}{\emptyset}$) then we know that adding $\lnot H$ to $G$ leads to contradiction (i.e. $\lnot H$ contradicts formulas in $G$)
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow H$ is true
    * If we cannot derive any new formula (i.e. $G$ contains only $\lnot H$) then we know that adding $\lnot H$ to $G$ doesn't lead to contradiction
    
    $\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow H$ is false

* Interpretation (for easy problem solving): use resolution tree with root $\{\}$
    * Each node is a clause with children are clauses used to obtain the clause (via resolution rule)
        * Formal: $a \lor b$ is the parent of $a \lor c$ and $b \lor \lnot c$

# BONUS
* Conjunctive normal form (CNF): a formula is in CNF if it's a conjunction (i.e. logical AND) of one or more clauses where a clause is a disjunction (i.e. logical OR) of symbols
    * Conjunct: a disjunction of one or more clauses
* Empty clause: the clause defined from an empty set of symbols
    * Ground truth value: always False
    * Notation: $\emptyset$
