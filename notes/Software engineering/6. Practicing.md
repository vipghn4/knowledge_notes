# 6. Practicing
## Some background on practicing
**Principle**. Writing and executing a program is proof that we can write and execute that program, not practicing

### Twenty-two zeros
**Principle**. Programming languages and programming tools  are getting better. But the nature of the statements has not changed at all

### Turn-around time
**Hammock-driven development**.
* Often it is better to slow down and just think
* But there are other times when spinning around the loop as fast as possible is highly productive

**Principle**. Doing anything quickly requires practice. Speed depends on practice
* *Explain*. When we are spinning around the code / test loop several times per minute, it is our body knowing what keys to hit
    * A primal part of our mind recognizes the situation and rects within milliseconds with the appropriate solution
    * Meanwhile, our mind is free to focus on the higher-level problem

**Practicing**. We choose a repertoire of problem-solution pairs and execute them over and over again, until we know them cold

## The coding Dojo
**Coding Dojo**. Everyone open their laptops and code along with the host as they used TDD to write Conway's Game of Life
* *Idea*. A group of programmers meet and practice together, just like martial artists do

    >**NOTE**. Sometimes, programmers will practice solo, again as martial artists do

### Kata
**Kata**. A kind of activities taking place in a dojo
* *Martial art meaning*. A precise set of choreographed movements simulating one side of a combat
* *Goal*. Perfection, i.e. the artist strives to teach his body to make each movement perfectly and to assemble movements into fluid enactment
* *Purpose*. Train our mind and body how to react in a particular combat situation

    $\to$ To make the perfected movements automatic and instinctive so that they are there when we need them

**Programming kata**. A precise set of choreographed keystrokes and mouse movements which simulates the solving of some programming problem

>**NOTE**. We are not actually solving the problem since we already know the solution
>
>$\to$ We are practicing the movements and decisions involved in solving the problem

* *Goal*. The asymptote of perfection
* *Usage*.
    * A good way to learn hot keys and navigation idioms
    * A good way to learn disciplines, e.g. TDD and CI
    * A good way to drive common problem-solution pairs into our subconscious

        $\to$ We know how to solve them when facing them in real programming

### Wasa
**Wasa**. Very much like two-man kata
* *Martial art meaning*. Routines are precisely memorized and played back, i.e.
    * One partner is the aggressor
    * One partner is the defender
    * The motions are repeated over and over again

**Programming wasa**.
* *Description*.
    1. Two partners choose a kata or a simple problem
    2. One programmer writes a unit test, and then the other must make it pass
    3. Reverse the roles

### Randori
**Randori**.
* *Martial art meaning*. A free-form combat
* *Programming meaning*. Two-man wasa, in which the partners are solving a problem
    1. Many people solving the same problem
    2. One person writes a test
    3. The screen projected on the wall
    4. The next person making the test pass will writes the next test

## Broadening our experience
### Open source
**Principle**. Take on some pro-bono work by contributing to an open-source project

### Practice ethics
**Principle**. Professional programmers practice on their own time
* *Explain*.
    * It is not our employer's job to keep our skills sharp
    * It is not our employer's job to keep our resume tuned
* *Consequence*. We do not have to use the same languages or platforms we use with our employer

# Appendix
## Tricks and advices
**Martial arts and coding**. Many programmers have adopted a martial arts metaphor for their practice session
