# 1. Professionalism
**Learn about taking responsibility** by suffering through the consequences of not taking it

## Do not harm to software function
**Do no harm to function of the software**. We harm the function of a software when we create bugs
* *Objective*. Not create bugs
* *Key idea*. We must be responsible for our imperfections, i.e. our bugs
    * *Explain*. The fact that perfect software is impossible does not imply that we are not responsible for the imperfection
* *Advices*.
    * Practice apologizing when errors occur
    * Do not repeat errors and apologize
    * Reduce our error rate rapidly overtime

**QA should find nothing**. It is unprofessional (in extreme) to purposely send code which you know to be faulty to QA
* *Faulty code*. Code which we are not certain about
* *Advice*
    * *Bad practice*. Use QA as bug catchers and send them uncertain code
    * *Good practice*. Do not release uncertain code to QA

**We must know our code works**.
* *Key idea*. We must test our code again and again to make sure that it works
* *Advices*.
    * Automate our test
        * *Explain*. We have schedules and deadlines to keep, thus we cannot spend all our time testing
    * We should test all the codes before release
    * Design our code so that we can test them easily
        * *Test Driven Development (TDD)*. Write test first, before we write code

## Do not harm to software structure
**Do not harm to software structure**. If we write inflexible structured codes, we are undercutting the economic model which the entire industry is based on
* *Key idea*. We must be able to make changes without exorbitant costs
* *Advices*.
    * If we want our software to be flexible, we have to flex it
    * The only way to prove that our system is easy to change is to make easy changes to it
    * When we find that changes are not as easy as we thought, then refine the design so that the next change is easier
    * If we have an automated suite of tests which covers virtually 100% of the code, we will not be afraid to change the code

## Work ethic
**Key idea**. Making ourself marketable or training ourself is our responsibility
* It's not our employer's responsibility to give us the time we need to learn, i.e. we should not expect that

**Advices**.
* We should plan on working 60 hours per week, i.e. 40 for our employer, 20 for ourself
    
    >**NOTE**. The 20 hours is for our career, not our employer, these hours are used to make ourself more valuable as a professional
    >**NOTE**. During the 20 hours, we should be fun!

### Practicing
**Kata**. The repetition of simple exercises
* *Purpose*. Practice our fingers and our brain
* *Example*. A simple programming problem to solve

>**NOTE**. The point of doing the kata is not to figure out how to solve the problem, we know how to solve it already

**Frequency of doing a kataI*. Do a kata or two every day, i.e.
* A 10-minute warm-up exercise in the morning
* A 10-minute cool-down exercise in the evening

### Domain knowledge
**Domain knowledge**. It is the responsibility of every software professional to understand the domain they are working on
* *Advices*.
    * When starting working on a domain
        * Read one or two book about that domain
        * Interview customers and users about the foundation and the basis of the domain
        * Spend time with experts to understand the principles of the field

# Appendix
## Tricks and advices
**Professionalism**
1. Professionalism is all about taking responsibility
2. When a professional makes a mistake, he cleans up the mess
3. When we cannot finish the task ontime, tell our boss (or customer), do not do things irresponsibly

**Software structure**.
1. A fundamental assumption underlying all software projects is that software is easy to change
2. Code structure must be flexible and maintainable
3. *Merciles refactoring*. Always check in a module cleaner than when we checked it out
    
    >**NOTE**. Most developers fear to make continuous changes to their code since they afraid that they will break it, ie. since they do not have tests

4. Professional developers are so certain of their code and tests that they are free to make random, opportunistic changes

**Work ethic**.
1. Professionals spend time caring for their profession
2. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
3. Practice is not daily job, it is when we specifically exercise our skills outside of the performance of our job for the purpose of refining and enhancing our skills
4. Put ourself in our employer's shoes, i.e. their problems are our problems. Thus, we need to find best solution

**Best ways to learn**. These points are sorted by efficiency
1. Mentoring
2. Collaborating
3. Practicing

## Knowledge list
**Must-know things of a software professsional**.
1. Design pattern
2. Design princle, i.e. SOLID principle
3. Methods, i.e. XP, Scrum, Learn, Kanban, Waterfall, Structured Analysis, and Structured Design
4. Disciplines, i.e. TDD, Object-oriented design, Structured programming, Continuous Integration, Pair programming
5. Artifacts, i.e. UML, DFDs, Structure charts, Petri Nets, State transition diagrams, Tables, flow charts, and decision table
