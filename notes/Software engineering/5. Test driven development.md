# 5. Test driven development
## The Jury is in
**Principle**. How can we consider ourself to be a professional if we do not know that all our code works?
* *Tests*.
    * We cannot know all our code works if we do not test it everytime we make a change
    * We cannot test it everytime we make a change if we do not have automated unit tests with very high coverage
* *Consequence*. We must practice test driven development

## The three laws of TDD
**Principle**. Three laws of TDD
1. We are not allowed to write any production code until we have first written a failing unit test
2. We are not allowed to write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing
3. We are not allowed to write more production code that is sufficient to pass the currently failing test

**Loop**.
1. Write a bit to test code
2. Write a bit to production code to make the test code compiles

### The litany of benefits
**Certainty**. If we adopt TDD as a professional discipline, then we will write dozens of tests everyday

$\to$ We will keep those tests on hand and run them anytime we make changes to code
* *Consequence*. If the tests pass, we are nearly certain, i.e. certain enough to ship, that the change we made did not break anything

    $\to$ If the tests all pass, we ship the code

**Defect injection rate**. TDD helps decreaing the defect injection rate dramatically

**Courage**. We have courage to fix bad code
* *Explain*. Once we fix bad code, we can run unit test and make sure things are okay

>**NOTE**. This is one of the most powerful benefits of TDD

**Documentation**. Writing unit tests is like writing documentation
* *Explain*. When following the three laws of TDD, we are
    1. Write code
    2. Describe how the system should be used
* *Example*. If we follow the three laws, then
    * There will be a unit test describing how to create every object in the system, every way to create objects
    * There will be a unit test describing how to call every function in the system everyway, so that the functions can be meaningfully called
* *Consequence*. Unit tests are documents
    * They describe the lowest-level design of the system
    * They are unambiguous, accurate, written so that audience understands
    * They are so formal that they execute

**Design**. Often we know exactly what code we want to write, but the three laws tell us to write a unit test that fails since the code does not exist

$\to$ We have to test the code that we are about to write
* *Problem with testing code*. We have to isolate the code to be tested
    * *Explain*. It is often difficult to test a function if the function calls other functions
    * *Consequence*. To write tests, we have to figure out some way to decouple the function (to be tested) from all others

        $\to$ The test first forces us to think about good design
* *Consequence*. Follwing the three laws, we have to
    1. Write our tests first
    2. Create a force which drives us to a better decoupled design

**The professional option**. TDD is a discipline which enhances certainty, courage, defect reduction, documentation, and design

## What TDD is not
**Principle**.
* We can still write bad code even if we write our tests first. Indeed, we can write bad tests
* There are times when following the three laws is impractical or inappropriat
