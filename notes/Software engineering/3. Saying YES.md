# 3. Saying YES
## A language of commitment
**Three parts of making a commitment**:
* Step 1: we say we'll do it
* Step 2: we mean to do it
* Step 3: we actually do it

### Recognizing lack of commitment
**Telltale signs of non-commitment**: we should look at the language we use when we commit to doing something, as the telltale sign of things to come
* Need / should
* Hope / wish
* Let's (not followed by "I ...")

### What does commitment sound like
**The secret ingredients to recognize real commitment**: "I will do something by sometime"
* *Explain*. We are stating a fact about something we will do with a clear end time

    $\to$ There's technically no way out of this verbal commitment (i.e. if we don't do what we promise, we will lose our reputation)
* *Consequence*. We put ourself in the situation which forces us to do something

    $\to$ This will help us get though the next two stages

### Reasons we might not mean to do something
**It wouldn't work because I rely on person X to get this done**: 
* *Solution*. We only commit to things which we have full control of

    $\to$ If we rely on someone else, we can commit to specific actions which will bring us closer to our target
* *Example*.
    * Create an interface which abstract our module's dependency from the other team
    * Create our personal build which runs our integration tests for the module

**It wouldn't work because we don't really know if it can be done**:
* *Solution*. If it can't be done, we can still commit to actions which will bring us closer to the target

**It wouldn't work because sometimes I just won't make it**:
* *Explain*. Something unexpected might happen so that we cannot get our work done and that's life
* *Solution*. Change the expectations, as soon as possible

    $\to$ Raise the flag to the stakeholders so that the team can stop and think through to change to a different commitment

## Learning how to say "YES"
### The other side of "try"
**Principle**. Instead of saying "try", we can describe our own uncertainty to the manager if he may be able to deal with the uncertainty

### Committing with discipline
**Principle**. If the proposed deadline is too close that we may think about dropping writing tests or something similar

$\to$ Say NO to save the professional

>**NOTE**. In case we are the last hope (i.e. the manager begs us for the deadline), know our limits and how much overtime we can effectively apply and the cost of overtiming
>$\to$ Tell the manager about that (i.e. the cost of overtiming)

## Tricks and advices
1. Use some language-related tricks to try and figure out if people really mean to do what they say
2. It isn't okay when we or someone else relies on promises as part of the jo
