# 12. Collaboration
## Programmers versus people
**Programmers versus employers**. It is good to be passionate about what we do, but it is also good to keep our eye on the goals of our employers
* *Responsibility of a professional programmer*. Meet the needs of his employer
    * *Explain*. Collaborate with our managers, BAs, testers, and other teammates to deeply understand the business goals

        >**NOTE**. We do not have to become a business work, it means that we need to understand 
        >* Why we are writing the codes we are writing
        >* How the business will benefit from it
* *Advices*. Pay attention to the ship we are sailing on
    * *Good practice*. Take time to understand the business
    * *Bad practice*. Bury ourself with technology, watching the business burns

**Programmers versus programmers**. Programmers often have difficulty working closely with other programmers
* *Wost symptom of a dysfunctional team*. Each programmer builds a wall around his code and refuses to let other programmers touch it
* *Consequences*.
    * Massive code duplication
    * Interfaces between modules are completely skewed

**Collective ownership**. It is far better to break down all walls of code ownership and have the team own all the code
* *Objective*. Any team member can check out any module and make any changes they think are appropriate

**Pairing**. Pair-programming is the most efficient way to solve the problem
* *Benefits of pair-programming*.
    * It is the best way to share knowledge with each other
    * All team members should be able play another position in a pinch
    * Pair programming is the best way to review code
