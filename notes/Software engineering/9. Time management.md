# 9. Time management
## Meetings
**Meeting cost**. About $200 per hour per attendee, i.e. including salaries, benefits, facilities costs, etc.
* *Facts about meetings*. 
    * Meetings are necessary
    * Meetings are huge time wasters
* *Professional behavior*. Professionals are aware of the high cost of meetings
    * *Consequence*. They actively resist attending meetings which do not have an immediate and significant benefit

### Declining
**Principle**. We do not have to attend every meeting, to which we are invited

>**NOTE**. It is unprofessional to go to too many meetings
>* Explain: The one inviting us to a meeting is not responsible for managing our time. Only us can do that

* *Consequence*. Only accept a meeting if our participation is immediately and significantly necessary to the job we are doing

**Common cases**.
* Sometimes, the meeting will be interesting, but is not immediately necessary
    
    $\to$ Can we afford the time?
* Sometimes, the meeting will be about something we can contribute to, but is not immediately significant to what we are doing

    $\to$ Is the loss to our project worth the benefit to theirs?
* Sometimes, our presence at the meeting will be requested by someone in authority

    $\to$ Does authority outweight our work schedule?

>**NOTE**. Our team and our supervisor can help making the decision

### Leaving
**Problem**. Meetings do not always go as planned
* *Cases*.
    * Sometimes, we find ourself sitting in a meeting which we would have declined had we know more
    * Sometimes, new topics get added, or somebody's pet peeve dominates the discussion
* *Solution*. Leave the meeting
    * *Explain*. We do not have that much time
    * *Strategies for leaving a meeting*.
        * Ask, at an opportune moment, if our presence is stilll necessary
        * Explain that we cannot afford a lot more time
        * Ask whether there is a way to expedite the discussion, or shuffle the agenda

**Principle**. Being in a meeting, which has become a waste of time for us, and to which we cannot significantly contribute, is unprofessional
* *Explain*. We are not spending our employer's time and money wisely

### Have an agenda and a goal
**Principle**. To use participants' time wisely, the meeting should have 
* A clear agenda, with times for each topic
* A stated goal

**Advices**.
* If we are asked to go to a meeting, make sure we know
    * What discussions are on the table
    * How much time is allotted for them
    * What goal is to be achieved
* If we cannot get a clear answer on points above, then decline to attend
* If we go to a meeting, whose agenda has been highly-jacked or abandoned
    
    $\to$ Request that the new topic be tabled, and the agenda be followed, otherwise leave the meeting when possible

### Stand-up meetings
**Stand-up meetings of Agile cannon**. Each participant takes a turn to answer three questions
1. What did I do yesterday?
2. What am I going to do today?
3. What is in my way?

>**NOTE**. Each question should require no more than 20 seconds, i.e. each participant has 1 minute

### Iteration meetings
**Iteration**. A work period, e.g. a week 

**Iteration planning meetings**. Select the backlog items, which will be executed in the next iteration
* *Preparation*.
    * Estimates should already be done for the candidate items
    * Assessment of business value should already be done
    * The acceptance / component tests are already written, or at least sketched out
* *In-meeting requirements*.
    * Each candidate backlog item should be briefly discussed and either selected or rejected
        * *Explain*. No more than 5 or 10 minutes should be spent on any given item

    >**NOTE**. If a longer discussion is required, it should be scheduled for another time, with a subset of the team
* *Rule of thumb*. The meeting should take no more than 5% of the total time in the iteration

**Iteration review and demo**. 
* *Objectives*. Meeting at the end of each iteration to
    * Discuss what went right and what went wrong
    * Stakeholders see a demo of the newly working features
* *Rule of thumb*. 
    * Spend 45 minutes before quitting time on the last day of the iteration
        * *Explain*. These meetings can be badly abused and can soak up a lot of time
    * Allocate no more than 20 minutes for review, and 25 minutes for demo
        * *Explain*. It has only been a week or two, so there should not be all that much to talk about

### Arguments and disagreements
**Principle**. Any argument, which cannot be settled in 5 minutes, cannot be settled by arguing
* *Explain*. There is no clear evidence supporting either side
* *Solution*. Go get some data or evidence

**Passive-aggressive behavior**. The worst kind of unprofessional behavior
* *Example*.
    * Agree just to end the argument
    * Sabotage the result by refusing to engage in the solution
* *Consequence*. Once we agree, we must engage

**Getting data to settle a disagreement**.
* Run experiments, simulation, or modeling
* Sometimes, the best way is to flip a coin to choose one of the two paths in question
    * If things work out, then that path was workable
    * Otherwise, we can go back and try the other path

**Advices**.
1. Avoid meetings just for argument purpose
2. If an argument must truly be settled, then
    1. Ask each of the arguers to present their case to the team in 5 minutes or less
    2. Have the team vote

## Focus manna
**Focus-manna as a scarce resource**. Focus is a scarce resource, just like manna
* *Explain*. After expending our focus-manna, we must recharge by doing unfocused activities for an hour or more
* *Consequence*. Professional developers learn to manage their time to take advantage of their focus-manna, i.e.
    * Write code when our focus-manna is high
    * Do other, less producetive things when it is not

**Focus-manna as a decaying resource**. If we do not use it when it is there, we are likely to lose it
* *Consequence*. If we spend all our focus-manna in a meeting, we will not have any left for coding

>**NOTE**. Worrying and distractions also consume focus-manna quickly

### Sleep
**Principle**. We will have the most focus-manna after a good night's sleep
* *Rule of thumb*. 7 hours of sleep often give us a full 8 hours' worth of focus-manna

**Professional behavior**. Manage their sleep schedule to ensure that they have topped up their focus-manna, by the time they get to work in the morning

### Caffein
**Principle**. Some of us can make more efficient use of our focus-manna by consuming moderate amounts of caffein

### Recharging
**Principle**. Focus-manna can be partially recharged by de-focussing

>**NOTE**. Once the manna is gone, we cannot force the focus
>* *Consequence*. It is better to take 30, or even 60 minutes, to de-focus

### Muscle focus
**Principle**. Martial arts, tai-chi, or yoga require significant focus, but it is a different kind of focus from coding

$\to$ They can help to recharge mental focus

>**NOTE**. Regular regimen of muscle focus increases our capacity for mental focus

### Input versus output
**Principle**. Balance our output with appropriate input
* *Example*. 
    * Writing a software is a creative exercise
    * We can gain creativity when being exposed to other people's creativity

## Time boxing and tomatoes
**Pomodoro technique for managing time and focus**.
* *Basic idea*.
    1. Set a standard kitchen timer for 25 minutes
    2. While the timer is running, let nothing interfere with what we are doing
    3. When the timer dings, we stop what we are doing immediately
    4. Process any interruptions occurred during the timer
    5. Take a break of 5 minutes or so
    6. Set the timer for another 25 minutes and start the next iteration
* *Consequences*. Our time is divided into timer and non-timer time
    * *Timer time*. Productive time
    * *Non-timer time*. Distractions, meetings, breaks, etc.

**Variations**.
* Estimate tasks in timers and then measure the weekly timer velocity
* See how much productive we are by plotting the timer day by day

## Avoidance
**Problem**. Sometimes, our heart is not in our work

**Priority inversion**. We find ways to avoid doing the real work, arguing that something else is more urgent, and we do that instead
* *Solution*.
    1. Evaluate the priority of each task, disregarding their personal fears and desires
    2. Execute the tasks in priority order

## Blind alleys
**Blind alleys**. Sometimes we make a decision and wander down a technical pathway which leads to nowhere

>**NOTE**. The more vested we are in our decision, the longer we will wander in the wilderness

**Advices**.
* Prudence and experience will help us avoid certain blind alleys, but we will never avoid them all
* The real skill we need is to quickly realize when we are in one, and have the courage to back out

**The rule of holes**. When we are in a blind alley, stop digging
* *Explain*. 
    * Avoid getting so vested in an idea which we cannot abandon it and turn around
    * Keep an open mind about other ideas, so that when we hit a dead end, we still have other options

## Marshes, bogs, swamps, and other messes
**Messes**. Worst than blind alleys are messes
* *Explain*. 
    * Messes slow us down, but do not stop us

        $\to$ We can always see the way forward, and it always looks shorter than the way back (but it is not, in fact)
    * Nothing has a more profound or long-lasting negative effect on the productivity of a software than a mess
* *Problem*. Starting a mess is unavoidable

**Progress of a mess**.
1. Create a solution to a simple problem, being careful to keep the code simple and clean
2. As the problem grows in scope and complexity, we extend the code base, keeping it as clean as we can
3. At some point, we realize a wrong design choice made when starting
    * *Going back* looks expensive since we will have to rework the existing code
    * *Going forward* looks less expensive

**Rule of thumb**. Going back will never be easier than it is now. If we go forward, we will drive the system into a swamp, which it may never escape
* *Consequence*. Moving forward through a swamp, when we know it is a swamp, is the worst kind of priority inversion

**Professional behavior**. Professionals fear messes far more than blind alleys
* *Consequences*. They are always on the lookout for messes, which start to grow without bound

# Appendix
## Tricks and advices
1. Our responsiblity is our projects first
2. One of the most important duties of our manager is to keep us from meetings, i.e. they concern about our time as we are
3. When meeting gets boring, leav
