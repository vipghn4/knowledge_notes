# 1. What is software architecture
## What software architecture is and what it is not
**The software architecture of a system**. The set of structures required to reason about the system, which comprise
* Software elements
* Relations among software elements
* Properties of both

**Structure**. A structure is a set of elements held together by a relation
* *Architectural structures*. Not all structures are architectural
    * *Example*. The set of lines of source code containing the letter `z`, ordered by increasing length from shortest to longest
* *Requirements for a architectural structure*. A structure is architectural if it supports reasoning about the system and the system's properties,
    * *Example*. Reasoning about an attribute of the system, which is important to some stakeholder

**Software system**. Composed of many structures, where no single structure holds claim to being the architecture

**Categories of architectural structure**. Architectural structures can be divided into major categories, depending on the broad nature of the elements they show
* *Module structures*. Structures which partition systems into implementation units, i.e. modules
    * *Modules*. Modules are assigned specific computational responsibilities

        $\to$ The elements are modules, i.e. units of implementation
        
        >**NOTE**. Modules are the basis of work assigments for programming teams
    
    * *Example*. Module decomposition structures is the struture capturing the decomposition of modules into submodules
    * *Static structure*. Module structures are static structures
* *Component-and-connector structures*. The system is to be built as a set of services
    * *Services*. Services are made up of programs in various implementation units

        $\to$ The elements are runtime components, i.e. units of computation, and connectors, i.e. communication vehicles among components
    
    * *Example*. A kind of structure often used to describe a system is composed of
        * The services
        * The infrastructure they interact with
        * The synchronization and interation relations among them
    * *Dynamic structure*. Component-and-connector structures are dynamic structures
* *Allocation structures*. Srtuctures which describes the mapping from software strctures to the system's organizational, developmental, installation, and execution environments
    * *Examples*.
        * Modules are assigned to teams to develop
        * Modules are assigned to places in a file structure for implementation, integration, and testing
        * Components are deployed onto hardware in order to execute

### Architecture is an abstraction
**Software architecture as an abstraction**. An architecture is an abstraction of a system, which selects certain details and suppresses others
* *Explain*. Architecture consists of structures and structures consists of elements and relations

    $\to$ An architecture comprises software elements and how they relate to each other
    * *Consequence*. Architecture specifically omits certain information about elements, which are not useful for reasoning about the system
        * *Explain*. It omits information, which has no ramifications outside of a single element

**Example**. In all modern systems, elements interact with each other via interfaces, which partition details about an element into public and private parts

$\to$ Architecture is concerned with the public side
* *Explain*. Private details of elements, i.e. details having to do solely with internal implementation, are not architectural

### Every software system has a software architecture
**Fact**. Every system can be shown to comprise elements and relations among them to support some type of reasoning
* *Consequence*. Every system has an architecture

>**NOTE**. In the most trivial case, a system itself is a single element

>**NOTE**. Every system has an architecture, but it does not necessarily follow that the architecture is known to anyone
>$\to$ This reveals the difference between the architecture of a system and the representation of that architecture

**Architecture and its representation**. An architecture can exist independently of its description or specification
* *Example*. When all we have is the executing binary code, i.e.
    * All the people who designed the system are long gone
    * The documentation has vanished
    * The source code has been lost
* *Consequence*. Architecture documentation is important

### Architecture includes behavior
**Fact**. The behavior of each element is part of the architecture insofar that behavior can be used to reason about the system
* *Explain*. This behavior embodies how elements interact with each other

>**NOTE**. Box-and-line diagrams are not architectures
>* *Explain*. These diagrams approach an architecture, but they spring from the imagination of the observer's mind, which relies on information which is not present

>**NOTE**. The exact behavior and performance of every element is not necessarily documented in all circumstances
>* *Explain*. Some aspect of behavior are fine-grained and below the architect's level of concern

**Conclusion**. If an element's behavior influences another element or the acceptability of the system as a whole

$\to$ This behabior must be considered and should be documented, as part of the software architecture

### Not all architectures are good architectures
**Fact**. Not all architectures are good architectures

**Consequence**. Architecture design is important

## Architectural structures and views
**Principle**. Modern systems are frequently too complex to grasp all at once

$\to$ We restrict our attention at any one moment to one, or a small number, of the software system's structures
* *Motivation*. The neurologist, the orthopedist, the hematologist, and the dermatologist all have different views of the structure of a human body
* *Consequence*. To communicate meaningfully about an architecture, we must make clear which structure(s) we are discussing at the mooment

### Structures and views
**View and structure**. A view is a representation of a structure
* *View*. A view is a representation of a coherent set of architectural elements, as written by and read by system stakeholders

$\to$ It consists of a representation of a set of elements and the relations among them
* *Structure*. A structure is the set of elements itself, as they exist in software or hardware

**Example**. 
* A module structure is the set of system's modules and their organization
* A module view is the representation of a module structure, documented according to a template, in a chosen notation, and used by some system stakeholders

**Conclusion**. Architects design structures. They document views of those structures

### Three kinds of structures
**Module structures**. Embody decisions as how the system is to be strutured, as a set of code or data unit which have to be constructed or procured
* *Elements*. Modules, i.e. units of implementation, e.g. classes, layers, etc.

>**NOTE**. Modules represent a static way of considering the system

* *Questions*. Module structures allow us to answer questions such as
    * What is the primary functional responsibility assigned to each module
    * What other software elements is a module allowed to use
    * What other software does it actually use and depend on
    * What modules are related to other modules by generalization or inheritance relationships
    * What is the impact on the system when the responsibilities assigned to each module change
* *Consequence*. Module views are an excellent way to reason about a system's modifiability

**Component-and-connector structures**. Embody decisions as how the system is to be structured, as a set of elements having runtime behavior (components) and interactions (connectors)
* *Elements*. Runtime components and connectors
* *Questions*. C&C structures allow us to answer questions such as
    * What are the major executing components and how do they interact at runtime
    * What are the major shared data stores
    * Which parts of the system are replicated
    * How does data progress through the system
    * What parts of the system can run in parallel
    * Can the system's structure change as it executes and, if so, how
* *Consequence*. C&C views are crucially important for asking questions about the system's runtime properties, e.g. performance, security, availability, etc.

**Allocation structures**. Embody decisions as how the system will relate to nonsoftware structures in its environment, e.g. CPUs, file systems, network, development teams, etc.
* *Questions*. Allocation structures allow us to answer questions such as
    * What processor does each software element execute on
    * In what directories or files is each element stored during development, testing, and system building
    * What is the assignment of each software element to development teams

### Structures provide insight
**Principle**. Each structure provides a perspective for reasoning about some of the relevant quality attributes
* *Examples*.
    * The module "uses" structure, i.e. what modules use what other modules, is strongly tied to the ease, with which a system can be extended or contracted
    * The concurrency structure, i.e. parallelism within the system, is strongly tied to the ease, with which a system can be made free of deadlock and performance bottlenecks

**Structures and design**. Each structure presents the architect wih an engineering leverage point, i.e. by designing the structures appropriately

$\to$ The desired quality attributes emerge

### Some more useful module structures
**Decomposition structure**. Show how modules are decomposed into smaller modules recursively until the modules are small enough to be easily understood
* *Struture units*. Modules related to each other by *is-a-submodule-of* relation
* *Benefits*.
    * Enumerate what the units of software will have to do and assign each item to a module for subsequent design and eventual implementation
    * Determine, to a large degree, the system's modifiability, by assuring that changes are localized
* *Usage*. Used as the basis for the development project's organization, e.g.
    * Documentation structure
    * Project's integration and test plans

**Uses structure**. 
* *Structure units*. Modules, perhaps classes, related by *uses* relation
    * *Uses relation*. A software unit uses another if the correctness of the former requires the presence of a correctly functioning version of the latter
* *Usage*. Engineer systems which can be extended to add functionality, or from which useful functional subsets can be extracted

$\to$ The ability to easily create a subset of a system allows for incremental development

**Layer structure**.
* *Structure units*. Layers, i.e. abstract "virtual machines" providing a cohesive set of services through a managed interface
    * *Strictly managed fashion*. Layers are allowed to use other layers
    * *Strictly layered system*. Layers are only allowed to use their immediately below layers
* *Benefits*. Provide a system with portability, i.e. the ability to change the underlying computing platform

**Class (or generalization) structure**. Support reasoning about collections of similar behavior or capability and parameterized differences
* *Structure units*. Classes related by *inherits-from* or *is-an-instance-of* relation
* *Benefits*. Allow us to reason about reuse and incremental addition of functionality

**Data model**. Describe the static information structure in terms of data entities and their relationships
* *Example*. In a banking system, entities are typically Account, Customer, etc.
