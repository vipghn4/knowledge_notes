# 2. Saying NO
## Introduction
**Principle**: Professionals speak truth to power, they have courage to say no to their managers
* Explain:
    * Slaves aren't allowed to say no
    * Laborers may be hesitant to say no
    * Professionals are expected to say no
    * Good managers want someone who has courage to say no

## Adversarial roles
**Principle**: don't be afraid to have be in a adversarial role to our boss
* Explain: hard decisions are best made through the confrontation of adversarial roles

### Managers and professionals programmers
**Managers and professionals programmers**. Both pursue and defend their objectives as aggressively as they can
* Consequence: If our boss asks us to do something which is impossible

$\hspace{1.0cm} \rightarrow$ We aren't doing our job if we say "YES"

**The best possible outcomes**. When we say "NO", our boss is counting on us to defend our objectives as aggressively as he defends his

$\to$ This is how the two are going to the the best possible outcome (i.e. the goal which we and our manager share)

### "Why" and "Fact"
**Principle**: "why" is a lot less important than "fact"
* Example: The fact that a function will require two weeks is much more important than why it takes two weeks

    $\to$ Don't try to explain "why" if not needed or useful (i.e. don't provide too much detail)

## High stakes
**Principle**: When the risk or the cost of failures is so high

$\to$ Give the managers the best information we can (this often means saying no)

## Being a "team player"
**Principle**: A team player isn't someone who says yes all the time

$\to$ Play for the team, tell the truth so that nothing impossible is assigned to our team

**Team player**: Play our position as well as we possibly can, and help our teammates when they get into a jam
* Characteristics:
    * Communicate frequently
    * Keep an eye for the teammates
    * Execute our own responsibilities as well as possible

### Trying
**Principle**: There's no "OK, we'll try", everything must be clear
* Explain: Promise to try is an admission that the goal is attainable through the application of extra effort (although it's impossible)

    $\to$ Promising to try is committing to succeed

### Passive aggreession
**Principle**: If our manager doesn't tell the customers about the discussion between him and us, we can
* *Solution 1*. Save copies of all appropriate memos on file

    $\to$ When the disaster trikes, we can show what we told the manager, and when we told him
* *Solution 2*. Communicate directly with the customer

    >**NOTE**: This is risky, but it's what being a team player is really all about

## The cost of saying YES
**Principle**: Sometimes, the only way to get to the right YES is to be unafraid to say NO

# Appendix
## Tricks and advices
1. Don't accept anything without question (both managers and programmers shouldn't do this), it's unprofessional
    * Explain: it comes up with no best possible outcome
2. Argue with our managers to come up with possible outcome, don't accept everything given
3. Don't say "I'll try" if we have no way to try
4. Be clear and clean to anybody and anythin
