# 11. Pressure
## Avoiding pressure
**Principle**: The best way to stay calm under pressure is to avoid the situations which cause pressure

>**NOTE**: Avoidance may not eliminate the pressure completely, but it can go a long way towards minimizing and shortening the high-pressure periods

### Commitments
**Principle**: Avoid committing to deadlines which we aren't sure we can meet
* *Explain*.
    * *Business goal*. Always want these commitments since they want to eliminate risk
    * *Our goal*. Make sure that the risk is quantified and presented to the business so that they can manage it appropriately

**Unrealistic commitments**.
* *Consequences of accepting unrealistic commitments*. Introduce a pressure to both the business and to ourselves
* *Roots of unrealistic commitments*. Sometimes, our business has made promises to the customers without consulting us
* *Professional solution*. 
    * Always help the business find a way to meet those commitments
    * Don't accept the commitments made by the business
        * *Explain*. If we can find no way to meet promises made by the business
        
            $\to$ The people who made the promises must accept the responsibility

### Staying clean
**Principle**. The way to go fast is to stay clean, not temporarily create a mess to move quickly
* *Explain*. Dirty always means slow

    $\to$ We should keep our systems, code, and design as clean as possible

    >**NOTE**. This doesn't mean that we spend endless hours polishing code
    >$\to$ It means that we don't tolerate meses

### Crisis discipline
**Principle**. We know what we believe by observing ourself in a crisis, i.e.
* If we follow the disciplines

    $\to$ We truly believe in those disciplines
* If in a crisis, we change our behavior

    $\to$ We don't truly believe in our normal behavior

**Tricks**. Choose disciplines which we feel comfortable following in a crisis then follow them all the time
* *Explain*. Following disciplines is the best way to avoid getting into a crisis

## Handling pressure
### Don't panic
**Principle**. To manage the stress, the worst thing we can do is to rush
* *Explain*. Sleepless nights won't help, sitting and fretting won't help

**Solution**. 
1. Slow down, think the problem through
2. Plot a course to the best possible outcome
3. Drive towards that outcome at a reasonable and steady pace

### Communicate
**Principle**. Let our teams and superiors know that we are in trouble, e.g.
* Tell them our best plans for getting out of trouble
* Ask them for their input and guidance
* Avoid creating surprises
    * *Explain*. Nothing makes people more angry and less rational than surprises

### Rely on our disciplines
**Principle**. When the going gets tough, trust our disciplines
* *Use of disciplines*. Give us guidance through times of high pressures

### Get help
**Principle**. Find an associate who is willing to hel
