# Top-level view of computer. Function and interconnection
## Computer function
**Steps of instruction processing**.
1. *Fetching cycle*. The processor reads, or fetches, instructions from memory one at a time
2. *Execute cycle*. The processor executes each instruction

**Instruction cycle**. The processing required for a single instruction

### Instruction fetch and execute

</div>

**Procedure**.
1. PC (program counter) register holds the address of the instruction to be fetched next

    >**NOTE**. Unless told otherwise, the processor always increments the PC after each instruction fetch so that it will fetch the next instruction in sequence

2. The fetched instruction is laoded into the instruction register (IR) in the processor

    >**NOTE**. The instruction contains bits specifying the action the processor should take
3. The processor interprets the instruction and performs the required action

</div>

**Types of actions**. An instruction's execution may involve a combination of the following actions
* *Processor-memory*. Data may be transferred from processor to memory or vice versa
* *Processor-I/O*. Data may be transferred from processor to a peripheral device or vice versa
* *Data processing*. The processor may perform some arithmetic or logic operation on data
* *Control*. An instruction may specify that the sequence of execution be altered

**Instruction cycle state diagram**.
* *Instruction address calculation (iac)*. Determine the address of the next instruction to be executed
* *Instruction fetch (if)*. Read instruction from its memory location into the processor
* *Operand address calculation (oac)*. If required, determine the address of the operand
* *Operand fetch (of)*. Fetch the operand from memory, or read it in from I/O
* *Data operation (do)*. Perform the operation indicated in the instruction
* *Operand store (so)*. Write the result into memory or out to I/O

>**NOTE**. For any given instruction cycle, some states may be null and others may be visited more than once

### Interrupts
**Interruption**. Virtually, all computers provide a mechanism, by which other modules, e.g. I/O or memory, may interrupt the normal processing of the processor
* *Purpose*. Improve processing efficiency
    * *Example*. Most external devices are much slower than the processor

        $\to$ The processor should not wait for those devices

**Stages of an I/O program**.
* *Preparation code*. Prepare for the actual I/O operation, e.g.
    * Copying data to be output into a special buffer
    * Preparing the parameters for a device command
* *Actual I/O command*. Without interrupts, once this command is issued

    $\to$ The program must wait for the I/O device to perform the requested function

    * *Example*. The program repeatedly performs a test operation to determine if the I/O operation is done
* *Completion code*. Complete the operation, e.g.
    * Set a flag indicating the success or failure of the operation

**Instruction cycle without interruption**.
1. The user program reaches a WRITE call
2. The WRITE call performs the I/O program
3. The user program continues its job

**Instruction cycle interruption**.
1. The user program reaches a WRITE call
2. The WRITE call performs the preparation part and the actual I/O command
3. The program continue its job while the I/O device performing the requested operation
4. When the I/O operation is done, the I/O device sends an interrupt request signal to the processor
    * The processor responds by suspending operation of the current program
    * The processor branches off to a program to service the particular I/O device, called *interrupt handler*
5. The processor resumes the original execution after the device is serviced

</div>

**Interrupt cycle**.
1. The processor checks to see if any interrupt signal is present
2. If no interrupts are pending, the processor proceeds to the fetch cycle
3. If an interrupt is pending
    * The processor suspends execution of the current program
    * The processor saves the context of the current program, including
        * The address of the next instruction to be executed
        * Relevant data of the processor's current activity
    * The processor sets the PC to the starting address of an *interrupt handler routine*

**The interrupt handler program** is generally part of the OS, i.e.
* It determines the nature of the interrupt
* It performs actions needed

**Multiple interrupts**. When some interrupt occurs while some interrupt are being handled
* *Approaches*.
    1. *Disabled interrupt*.
        * *Description*.
            * Disable interrupts while an interrupt is being processed
            * Process disabled interrupts once the current interrupt is done
        * *Advantages*. Siple and nice
        * *Drawback*. No relative priority or time-critical needs are taken into account
    2. *Interrupt priority*. Define priorities for interrupts and handle higher priortized interrupts first
        * *Description*.
            * Choose the highest prioritized interrupt to process
            * Stop the current interrupt processing if some higher prioritized interrupt is pending

### Expansions
>**NOTE**. Most external devices are much slower than the processor

## Interconnection structures
**Interconnection structure**. The collection of paths connecting the various modules of a computer

**Computer modules**.

    <figcaption>Computer modules</figcaption>
</div>

* *Memory*. A memory module consists of $N$ words of equal length
    * *Memory word*. Each word has a unique numerical address, i.e. $0,1,\dots,N-1$
    * *Operations*. A word of data can be read from, or written into, the memory
* *I/O module*. I/O is functionally similar to memory
    * *External devices*. An I/O module may control several devices
        * *Ports*. The interfaces of external devices
        * *Address*. Each port has a unique address
        * *Data path*. There are external data paths for the I/O of data with an external device
    * *Operations*.
        * Read and write
        * Send interrupt signals to the processor
* *Processor*.
    * *Operations*.
        * Read in instructions and data
        * Write out data after processing
        * Use control signals to control the overall operation of the system
        * Receive interrupt signals

**Types of data transfers**.
* *Memory to processor*. The processor reads an instruction, or a unit of data from memory
* *Processor to memory*. The processor writes a unit of data to memory
* *I/O to processor*. The processor reads data from an I/O device via an I/O module
* *Processor to I/O*. The processor sends data to the I/O device
* *I/O to / from memory*. I/O exchanges data directly with memory
