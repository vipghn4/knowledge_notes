# 4. Coding
## Preparedness
**Coding objectives**.
1. Our code must work
    * We must understand the problem we are solving
    * We must understand how to solve our prolem
    * We must ensure that our code is a faithful representation of the solution
2. Our code must solve the problem set for us by the customer
    * We have to see and negotiate with our customer to ensure that their true needs are met
        * *Explain*. Customer's requirements often do not actually solve their problems
3. Our code must fit well into the existing system
4. Our code must be readable by other programmers

### Worry code
**Principle**. After we got into a big fight with our spouse or friend, there was a background process running in our mind trying to resolve, or at least review the fight

$\to$ This is distracting, i.e. we are working through the problem in the background rather than actually solving the coding problem
* *Solution*. 
    * Resolve the worry, then code, rather than coding right away
    * Learn to shutdown the background process, or at least reduce its priority so that it is not a continuous distraction

**Time partitioning**. A solution to resolve distraction
* *Idea*. Spend a block of time, e.g. an hour, working on the issue which is creating the worry
* *Personal time and office time*. Ideally, the time spent working on personal issues would be personal time
    * *Good practice*. Allocate personal time to ensure that the time spent at office is as productive as possible
        * *Explain*. Set aside time at home to settle our anxieties so that we do not bring them to the office

        >**NOTE**. If we find ourself at the office and the background anxieties are harming our productivity, then spend an hour quieting them

## The flow zone
**Flow**. Also called *the Zone*. The hyper-productive state, i.e. when we are highly focusing
* *Symptoms*. We feel productive and infallible

**Principle**. Avoid the Zone, since it is not really hyper-productive and certainly not infallible
* *Explain*. The Zone is really just a mild meditative state, in which certain rational falcuties are diminished in favor of a sense of speed
* *Effects of the Zone*. We will write more code in the Zone, and feel a mild euphoria or a sense of conquest
    * *Consequence*. We will lose some of the big picture, thus we will likely make decisions which we will later have to go back and reverse

        $\to$ Code written in the Zone may come out faster, but will be revisited more
* *Solution*. 
    * When being in the Zone, do something else
    * To present the Zone, do pair-coding, i.e. it is virtually impossible for a pair to enter the Zone

**When should we get into the Zone**. When we are practicing

### Interruptions
**Problem**. What if someone ask for help when we are coding
* *Effects*. We may be trying to understand their problem, which requires concentration. Thus we lose concentration on our problem
* *Solution*.
    * Pair-coding, i.e. our partner can hold the context of the problem at hand, while we deal with other's problem
    * Test-driven development (TDD), i.e. if we have a failling test, the test holds the context of where we are

**Principle**. The next time, we may be the one who needs to interrupt someone else. Thus, the correct attitude is a polite willingness to be helpful

## Writer's block
**Problem**. Sometimes, the code just does not come
* *Roots*. Lack of sleep, worry, fear, and depression
* *Solution*. Find a pair partner
    * *Explain*. When we sit down next to someone else, the issues blocking us melt away

### Creative input
**Principle**. Creative output depends on creative input
* *Example*. The thing that best primes the pump of creative output is science fiction, i.e. creative input

>**NOTE** Not all forms of creative input result in creative output. Thus, find a good source of creative input for you!

## Pacing ourself
**Principle**. Software development is a marathon, not a sprint. We cannot win the race by trying to run as fast as we can. We win by conserving our resources and pacing ourself
* *Consequence*. Professional programmers conserve their energy and creativity with the same care

### When to walk away
**Problem**. We cannot go home until we solve this problem?
* *Solution*. When we are stuck, or getting tired, disengage for awhile
    * *Explain*. Creativity and intelligence are fleeting states of mind, i.e. when we are tired, they go away
        
        $\to$ If we pound our nonfunctioning brain for hour after late-night hour trying to solve a problm, we will simply make ourself more tired and reduce the possibility of solving the problem

**Activities to reduce tiredness**.
* Driving home
* The shower

## Being late
**Problem**. We will be late. Sometimes, we just blow our estimates and wind up late
* *The trick to manage lateness*. Early detection and transparency, i.e.
    * Regularly measure our progress against our goal
    * Come up with three fact-based end dates, i.e. best case, nominal case, and worst case
    * Do not incorporate hope into our estimates
    * Present all three numbers to our team and stakeholders and update these numbers daily

### Hope
**Principle**. Do not hope that we can get a 10-days task all done within 2 days. Hope is the project killer
* *Explain*. Hope destroys schedules and ruins reputations. Hence, it will get us into deep trouble
* *Good practice*. 
    * Make sure that the team and the stakeholders understand the situation and do not let up until there is a fall-back plan
    * Do not let anyone else have hope

### Rushing
**Principle**. If our boss ask us for a deadline, hold to our estimates!
* *Explain*. Our original estimates are more accurate than any changes we make in front of our boss
* *Good practice*. Tell our boss that we have considered the options, and the only way to improve the schedule is to reduce scope
    * *Explain*. There is no way to rush, we cannot make ourself code faster or solve problems faster
        * We will start taking shortcuts and working extra hours in the hope of working a miracle
        * We will give ourself, our team, and our stakeholders false hope

>**NOTE**. Do not tempted to rush

### Overtime
**Principle**. Overtime can work, and sometimes it is necessary
* *Risks*.
    * We are not likely to get 20% more work done by working 20% more hours
    * Overtime will certainly fail if it goes on for more than two or three weeks
* *Consequence*. Do not agree to work overtime unless
    * We can personally afford it
    * It is short term, i.e. two weeks or less
    * Our boss has a fall-back plan in case overtime effort fails

        >**NOTE**. This is th deal breaker criterion

### False delivery
**Principle**. Saying we have done when we know we are not is the worst unprofessional behavior
* *More insidious case*. When we manage to rationalize a new definition of "done"
    * *Example*.
        * We convince ourselves that we are done enough, and move on to the next task
        * We rationalize that remaining any work can be dealt with later when we have more time 

>**NOTE**, THis is a contagious practice, i.e. if one programmer does it, others will see and follow suit

### Define "Done"
**Principle**. To avoid false delivery, we create an independent definition of "done"
* *Best practice*. Have our BAs and testers create automated acceptance tests which must pas before we can say that we are done

>**NOTE**. The tests should be understandable by the stakeholders and business people, and should be run frequently

## Help
**Principle**. Programming is hard
* *Explain*.
    * When we are young, we less believe this, since after all, it is just a bunch of `if` and `while` statements
    * After gaining experience, we begin to realize that we way we combine `if` and `while` statements is critically important
* *Consequence*. No matter how skilled we are, we will certainly benefit from another programmer's thoughts and ideas

### Helping others
**Principle**. It is the responsibility of programmers to be available to help each other
* *Explain*. Our work is not so important that we cannot lend some time to help others
* *Good practice*. Offer helps whenever it is needed, i.e. we should be conscious of the status of our teammates

    $\to$ If we see someone in trouble, we should offer our help

>**NOTE**. When we help someone, sit down and write code together. Plan to spend the better part of an hour or more, so that we will not appear to be rushed

### Being helped
**Principle**. When someone offers to help us, be gracious about it, i.e. accept the help gratefully and give ourself to that help
* *Bad practices*.
    * Protect our turf when getting offers to help
    * Push the helps away since we are under the gun
* *Good practice*. Be honor bound to offer helps and accept helps

**Learning to ask for help**. When we are stuck, or befuddled, or just cannot wrap our mind around a problem

$\to$ Ask someone for help

>**NOTE**. Asking for help is a metter of professional ethics

### Mentoring
**Principle**. Training less experienced programmers is the responsibility of those who have more experience
* *Explain*. Nothing can bring a young SWE to high performance quicker than his own drive, and effective mentoring by his seniors
* *Consequence*. Young programmers have a professional duty to seek out mentoring from their seniors

# Appendix
## Tricks and advices
1. When we are tired or distracted, do not code. Instead, find a way to eliminate the distractions and settle our mind
    * *Explain*. Otherwise, we will only end up redoing what we did
2. Dedication and professionalism are more about discipline than hours
    * *Example*. Writing code at 3AM is not what serious professionals do!
3. Make sure that our sleep, health, and lifestyle are tuned so that we can put in 8 good hours per day
4. Do not keep telling everyone that we will be on time, then let them all dow
