# 13. Teams and projects
## Do team and projects blend?
**Principle**. There is no such thing as half a person
* *Bad practice*. There are many projects, each of which is so small that no individual can be assigned to it on a full-time basis. Everybody is working on the project at 50 or even 25 percent

### The gelled team
**Principle**. It takes time for a team to form, i.e. prior to beginning to gel
* They must learn how to collaborate with each other
* They must learn each other's quirks, strengths, and weakness

**Benefits of a gelled team**.
* They can work miracles
* They anticipate each other, cover each other, support each other, and demand the best from each other
* They make things happen

**Common time for a team to gel**. 6 months, or even a year

**Gelled team structure**.
* *Number of members*. The best number is probably around 12
* *Components of a team*. Programmers, testers, analysts, and a project manager
    * *Team structure*. The ratio of programmers to testers and analysts can vary greatly, but 2:1 is a good number
    * *Roles*.
        * *Project manager*. Track the progress of the team and make sure the team understands the schedules and priorities
        * *Coach*. A part-time employee with responsibility for defending the team's process and disciplines, especially when the team is tempted to go off-process due to schedule pressure
* *Example*. 7 programmers, 2 testers, 2 analysts, 1 project manager

### Team or project came first?
**Principle**. Professional development organizations allocate projects to existing gelled teams, rather than forming teams around projects
* *Explain*. A gelled team can accept many projects simultaneously and will divvy up the work according to their own opinions, skills, and abilities

### How can we manage gelling teams
**Team velocity**. The amount of work the team get done in a fixed period of time
* *Measuring team velocity*. Measure it for many short periods, e.g. per week, then average the results
* *Usage*. Set targets for each project given to a team

### The project owner dilemma
**Problem**. If we focus on teams, the project owners lose some security and power
* *Solution*. 
    * Project owners who have a team dedicated to their project can count on the effort of that team
    * Forming and disbanding a team is expensive operation, thus the business will not take the team away for short-term reasons
    * If projects are given to gelled teams and those teams take on several projects at the same time

        $\to$ The business is free to change priorities on a whim

# Appendix
## Discussions
**Difference between testers and analysts**.
* *Similarities*.
    * *Analysts*. Develop the requirements and write automated acceptance tests
    * *Testers*. Write automated acceptance tests
* *Difference*. 
    * Analysts focus on business values and write the happy path cases
    * Testers focus on correctness and worry about what may go wrong, writing failure and boundary case
