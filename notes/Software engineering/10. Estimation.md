# 10. Estimation
## What is an estimate
**Estimates from different perspective**.
* *From business' perspective*. Estimates are commitments
* *From developers' perspective*. Estimates are guesses

### A commitment and an estimate
**A commitment**. A commitment is something we must achieve, i.e. if we made the commitment, we have to honor it
* *Explain*. Commitment s about certainty. Other people are going to accept our commitments and make plans based upon them
* *Cost of missing commitments*. Our reputation will be ruined dramatically
    * *Explain*. Missing a commitment is an act of dishonesty only slightly less onerous than an overt lie

**An estimate**. No commitment is implied, no promise is made. Mising an estimate is not in any way dishonorable
* *Explain*. We make estimates since we do not know how long something will take
* *The true nature of an estimate*. An estimate is not a number, it is a distribution

**Professional's behavior**. Draw a clear distinction between estimates and commitments
* *Behaviors*.
    * They do not commit unless they know for certain they will succeed
    * They are careful not to make any implied commitments
    * They communicate the probability distribution of their estimates as clearly as possible
* *Objective*. Managers can make appropriate plans

## PERT
**PERT's way to calculate estimates**. Provide a very simple, but very effective way to convert estimates into probability distributions suitable for managers

**Single-task estimation**.
* *Phase 1. Trivariate analysis*. Produce three numbers
    * *Optimistic estimate $\cal{O}$*. The wildly optimistic estimate, i.e. we can only get the task done this quicly if absolutely everything went right
    * *Normal estimate $\cal{N}$*. This is the estimate with greatest chance of success
    * *Pessimistic estimate $\cal{P}$*. This is the time we will achieve our goal if every risk happens
* *Phase 2. Estimation distribution*.
    * *Expected duration of the task*. $\mu = \frac{{\cal{O}} + 4{\cal{N}} + {\cal{P}}}{6}$
    * *Standard deviation of the distribution*. $\sigma = \frac{{\cal{P}} - {\cal{O}}}{6}$

**Multi-task estimation**. Use probability rules, i.e.
$$\mu = \sum_{i=1}^n \mu_i, \qquad \sigma = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^2}$$

## Estimating tasks
**Principle**. The most important estimation resource we have are people around us
* *Explain*. 
    * They can see things that we do not
    * They can help us estimate our tasks more accurately than ourself

### Wideband delphi
**Wideband delphi**. An estimation technique based on consensus

**Idea**.
1. A team of people assemble
2. The team discuss a task and estimate the task
3. The team iterate the discussion and estimation until they reach agreement

### Flying fingers
**Flying fingers**. A variation of wideband delphi method

**Idea**.
1. A team sit around a table
2. Tasks are discussed one at a time. For each task
    * There is discussion about what the task involves
    * What may confound or complicate it
    * How the task may be implemented
3. The moderator counts 1-2-3, and all the participants show their hands at once
    * Each participant raise 0 to 5 fingers based on how long they think the task will take

    >**NOTE**. The simultaneity of displaying the fingers is important, i.e. we do not want people changing their estimates based on what they see others do
4. If everyone agrees, then they go on to the next task. Otherwise, they continue the discussion to determine why they disagree and repeat until reaching agreement

### Planning poker
**Planning poker**. A variation of wideband delphi method

**Idea**.
1. For each member of the estimation team, deal a hand of cards with different numbers on them, e.g. from 0 to 5
2. Pick a task and discuss it
3. At some point, the moderator asks everyone to pick a card
4. The members of the team pull out a card which matches their estimate and hold it up with the back facing outward, i.e. no one can see the value of the card
5. The moderator tells everyone to show their cards

### Affinity estimation
**Affinity estimation**. A variation of wideband delphi method

**Idea**. 
1. All the tasks are written onto cards, without any estimates showing
2. The estimation team stands around a table with the cards spread out randomly
3. The team members start sorting the cards relative to one another, without talking
    * *Task order*. Tasks taking longer are moved to the right

## The law of large numbers
**Principle**. If we break up a large task into many smaller tasks and estimate them independently

$\to$ The sum of the estimates will be more accurate than a single estimate of the larger task
* *Explain*. Errors in the small tasks tend to integrate out

# Appendix
## Tricks and advices
1. Professionals do not make commitments unless they know they can achieve them
    * If we are asked to commit to something we are not certain we can do, then we are honor bound to decline
    * If we are asked to commit to something we can achieve, but by working very hard, then the choice is yours

    >**NOTE**. We would better be willing to do what it takes
2. Most software developers are terrible estimators
    * *Explain*. We do not understand the true nature of an estimate
3. "Can you try to make it no more than six days?". If we agree to "try" then we are committing to six days
    * *Explain*. 
        * Agreeing to try is agreeing to succeed
        * Agreeing to try without actually trying, i.e. working more than 8 hours or working over weekends, is not good
4. Software professionals are very careful to set reasonable expectations despite the pressure to try to go fast
5. Agreement does not need to be absolute. As long as the estimates are close, it is good enoug
