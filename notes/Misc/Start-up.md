# Start-up plan
**Start-up ideas**. In order to make value, we have to solve problems which people need

* *Approaches*. These four approaches of getting start-up ideas come from converting my research experience to business sense
  * *Approach 1*. Find some emerging problem which need to be solved and solve it
      * *First step*. Observe problems, which has not been solved yet

          $\to$ This is more risky, i.e. it is like finding a new path, which has not been explored before, and move forward that path
      * *Pros and cons*.
          * *Pros*. It might require least resources
          * *Cons*. It is more risky, i.e. why didn't people solve this before?
  * *Approach 2*. Find some solved problem and solve it better w.r.t some aspect
      * *First step*. Observe aspects which can be improven of some existing work

          $\to$ This is easier thaand how tween approach 1 and 3, i.e.
          * Not as cheap as approach 1, in terms of resources
          * Not as difficult as approach 3
  * *Approach 3*. Solve an solved problem with better approach
      * *First step*. Be better at the problem than competitors

          $\to$ This may be hard, i.e. it is like competing directly against large AI labs, with limited resources (in this case, the resource is our mind), in AI research
      * *Pros and cons*.
          * *Pros*. It might require too many resources
          * *Cons*. It is the most safer approach (if we succeed)
  * *Approach 4*. Combine existing works by others to solve a particular problem
      * *First step*. Have a wide knowledge of what we can do and how well we can do, i.e. it is like applied-research, which is to combine existing research works to solve a particular problem

          $\to$ We will work as an intermediate layer between backend server, i.e. the vendors, and the frontend, i.e. the customers
      * *Pros and cons*.
          * *Pros*. We don't have to directly involve in making base productions
          * *Cons*. We cannot grow too large, and we have to understand the market welland how
* *Evaluating start-up ideas*. Use SWOT analysis
    * *Internal factors*. Strengths, and Weakness
    * *External factors*. Opportunities, and Threats
* *Notable ideas*. Borrowed from Full-stack deep learning bootcamp
    * Places where cheap predictions make valuable profit
    * Places where we can automate a single step within a complex pipelin
