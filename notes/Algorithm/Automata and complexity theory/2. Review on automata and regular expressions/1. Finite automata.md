# Finite automata
**Computational model**. Real computers are complicated to allow us to set up a manageable mathematical theory of them directly

$\to$ We use an idealized computer, called a computational model
* *Types of computational models*. A computational model may be accurate in some sense but not in others

    $\to$ We use several different computational models, depending on the features we want to focus on

**Motivating examples**. Finite automata are good models for computers with an extremely limited amount of memory
* *Example*. Finite automata lies at the heart of various eletromechanical devices, e.g. the controller for an automatic door

    </div>

    * *Idea*. Automatic doors swing open when sensing that a person is approaching
        * *Door components*.
            * A pad in front to detect the presence of a person about to walk thourgh the doorway
            * A pad located to the rear of the doorway for the controller to hold the door open for long enough for the person to pass through
    * *Controller states*. `OPEN` or `CLOSED`, i.e. the corresponding condition of the door
    * *Controller input conditions*. 
        * `FRONT`, i.e. a person is standing on the pad in front of the doorway
        * `REAR`, i.e. a person is standing on the pad to the rear of the doorway
        * `BOTH`, i.e. people are standing on both pads
        * `NEITHER`, i.e. no one is standing on either pad
    * *State transition*. The controller moves from state to state, depending on the received input
    * *Conclusion*. The controller is a computer with a single bit of memory, capable of recording which of the two states the controller is in
* *Other examples*.
    * Elevator controller with larger memories, i.e. a state may represent the floor the elevator is on, and the inputs is the signals received from the buttons
    * Household appliances' controllers
* *Representation*. Use state diagram, or state transition table

**Finite automata and Markov chains**. Markov chains are probabilistic counterpart of finite automata, which are useful tools when dealing with pattern recognition in data

$\to$ These devices are used in speech processing and OCR

**State diagram of finite automata**. Consider the following state diagram of a finite automaton $M_1$

* *State and transition*.
    * *Start state $q_1$*. Indicated by the arrow pointing at it from nowhere
    * *Accept state $q_2$*. The one with double circle
    * *Transitions*. The arrows going from one state to another
* *Input processing*. When $M_1$ receives an input string, e.g. `1101`, it processes the string and produces an output, which are either accept or reject, i.e. yes/no answer
    * *Work flow*. 
        1. The processing begins in the start state
        2. The automaton receives the symbols from the input string one by one, from left to right

            $\to$ After reading each symbol, $M_1$ moves from one state to another along the transition having that symbol as its label
        3. When reading the last symbol, $M_1$ produces its output

            $\to$ The output is accept if $M_1$ is in an accept state, otherwise the output is reject

## Formal definition of a finite automaton
**Finite automaton**. A 5-tuple $(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F)$, where
* $Q$ is a finite set of states
* $\Sigma$ is a finite set of symbols, i.e. alphabet
* $\delta:Q\times \Sigma\to Q$ is the transition function
* $q_0\in Q$ is the start state
* $F\subseteq Q$ is the set of accept states

**Language of machine $M$**. The set of all strings accepted by $M$, i.e. $L(M)=A$

$\to$ $M$ is said to recognize $A$ or accept $A$

>**NOTE**. Since "accept" has different meanings when referring to machines accepting strings and machines accepting languages
>
>$\to$ "Recognize" is preferred to avoid confusion

>**NOTE**. A machine may accept several strings, but it always recognizes only one language

>**NOTE**. If a machine accepts no strings, it still recognizes one language, i.e. the empty language $\emptyset$

**Formal description of a machine**. Describing a finite automaton by state diagram is not possible in some cases, e.g. when the diagram is too big to draw, or the description depends on some unspecified parameter

$\to$ We resort to a formal description to specify the machine
* *Example*. For each state $q_j$, we may describe $\delta$ as
    * $\delta_i(q_j,0)=q_j$
    * $\delta_i(q_j,1)=q_k$ where $k=(j+1)\mod i$
    * $\delta_i(q_j,2)=q_k$ where $k=(j+2)\mod i$
    * $\delta_i(q_j,\text{RESET})=q_0$

## Formal definition of computation
**Acceptance of string**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $M=(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F)$ is a finite automaton
    * $w=w_1 w_2 \dots w_n$ is a string, where $w_i\in\Sigma$
* *Acceptance of string*. $M$ accepts $w$ if a sequence of states $r_0,\dots,r_n$ in $Q$ exists with three conditions
    * $r_0=q_0$, i.e. the machine starts in the start state
    * $\delta(r_i,w_{i+1})=r_{i+1}$, for $i=0,\dots,n-1$, i.e. the machine goes from state to state, according to the transition function
    * $r_n\in F$, i.e. the machine accepts its input if it ends up in an accept state
* *Notation*. $M$ is said to recognizes language $A$ if $A=\{w:M\text{ accepts }w\}$

**Regular language**. A language recognized by some finite automaton

## Designing finite automata
**Brief**. Design is a creative process, which cannot be reduced to a simple recipe or formula
* *Approach to design various types of automata*. Put ourself in the place of the machine we are trying to design, then see how we would go about performing the machine's task

    $\to$ This is a psychological trick helping engage our whole mind in the design process

## The regular operations
**Brief**. Understanding the properties of finite automata and regular languages helps develop a toolbox of techniques to use when desinging automata to recognize particular languages

**Objects and tools in computation theory**. The objects are languages and the tools include operations specifically designed for manipulating them
* *Analogy in arithmetic*. The basic objects are numbers, and the tools are operations for manipulating them, e.g. addition or multiplication
* *Regular operations*. Basic operations on languages, i.e. consider two languages $A$ and $B$
    * *Union*. $A\cup B=\{x:x\in A\lor x\in B\}$
    * *Concatenation*. $A\circ B=\{xy:x\in A\land y\in B\}$
    * *Star*. $A^*=\{x_1x_2\dots x_k:k\geq 0\land x_i\in A\}$
        * *Explain*. Set of all strings, which can be written as the concatenation of zero or more strings from $A$

**Closed collection of objects**. A collection of objects is closed under some operation if applying the operation to members of the collection returns an object in the collection
* *Theorem*. The collection of regular languages is closed under regular operations
* *Proof*.
    * *Assumptions*.
        * $A_1$ and $A_2$ are regular languages
        * $M_1$ is a finite automaton recognizing $A_1$
        * $M_2$ is a finite automaton recognizing $A_2$
    * *Proof for union operation*. To prove that $A_1\cup A_2$ is regular, we demonstrate a finite automaton $M$ recognizing $A_1\cup A_2$
        * *Requirements on $M$*. 
            * $M$ accepts its input exactly when either $M_1$ or $M_2$ would accept it in order to recognize $A_1\cup A_2$
            * $M$ works by simulating both $M_1$ and $M_2$ and accepting if either of the simulation accept
        * *Implementation of $M$*. As the input symbols arrive one by one, we simulate both $M_1$ and $M_2$ simultaneously

            $\to$ Only one pass through the input is required, i.e. we cannot rewind the input tape once the symbols have been read and used to simulate $M_1$
            * *Keeping track of simulations simultaneously*. We need to remember a pair of states, i.e. the state that each machine would be in, if it had read up to a certain symbol
        * *Number of states in $M$*. $k_1\times k_2$, where
            * $k_1$ is the number of states in $M_1$
            * $k_2$ is the number of states in $M_2$
    * *Proof for concatenation operation*. Similarly, we construct $M$ by treating each accept state of $M_1$ as an initial state of $M_2$
    * *Proof for star operation*. Similarly, we construct $M$ by recurrently treating each accept state of $M_1$ as one of its initial state

# Appendix
## Discussion
**Precision of a formal definition**. A formal definition must resolve any uncertainties
* *Notation*. Good notation helps thinking and expressing our thoughts clearly
* *Language of a formal defintion*. Arcane, having some similarity to the language of legal document, i.e. both need to be precise, and every detail must be spelled out
