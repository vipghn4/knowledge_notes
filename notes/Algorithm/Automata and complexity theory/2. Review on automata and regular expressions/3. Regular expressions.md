# Regular expressions
**Regular expressions**. Expressions describing languages, which are built using the regular operations

$\to$ The value of a regular expression is a language
* *Analogy in arithmetic*. We can use operations $+$ and $\times$ to build up expressions like $(5+3)\times 4$

    $\to$ The value of the arithmetic expression is a number

>**NOTE**. Regular expressions describe regular languages, not how a DFA or NFA behaves conditional on each string of the language

* *Example*. Consider the expression $(0\cup 1) 0^*$, this means the language $\{0,1\}\circ \{0\}^*$, i.e.
    * The symbols $0$ and $1$ are shorthand for the sets $\{0\}$ and $\{1\}$

        $\to$ $0\cup 1=\{0,1\}$
    * $0^*$ means $\{0\}^*$, i.e. all strings containing any number of $0$s
    * The concatenation symbol $\circ$ is implicit in regular expressions
* *Usage*. Regular expressions have an important role in computer science applications, e.g.
    * In applications involving text, users may want to search for strings satisfying certain patterns
    * In compilers for programming languages, i.e.
        * Tokens, i.e. elemental objects in a programming language, e.g. variable names and constants, may be described with regular expressions
        * Once the syntax of the tokens of the programming language have been described with regular expressions

            $\to$ Automatic systems can generate the lexical analyzer, i.e. part of a compiler which initially processes the input program
* *Operation order*. The star operation is done first, followed by concatenation, and finally union, unless parentheses are used to change the usual order
    * *Analogy in arithmetic*. $\times$ has precedence over $+$, i.e. when there is a choice, we do $\times$ first

**Formal definition of regular expressions**. $R$ is a regular expression if 
* $R$ is $a$ for some $a$ in the alphabet $\Sigma$, i.e. $R=\{a\}$
* $R$ is $\varepsilon$, i.e. empty string
* $R$ is $\emptyset$
* $R$ is $(R_1\cup R_2)$, where $R_1$ and $R_2$ are regular expressions
* $R$ is $(R_1\circ R_2)$, where $R_1$ and $R_2$ are regular expressions
* $R$ is $(R_1^*)$, where $R_1$ is a regular expressions

**Circular definitions and inductive definitions**. The definition of regular expression includes itself, leading to invaliditiy

$\to$ However, $R_1$ and $R_2$ are smaller than $R$, hence we are defining regular expressions in terms of smaller ones, hence avoiding circularity

**Other notations**. 
* $R^+$ is a shorthand for $RR^*$
* $R^k$ denotes the concatenation of $k$ $R$'s with each other

**Theorem**. Consider any regular expression $R$
* $R\cup\emptyset =R$, i.e. adding the empty language to any other language will not change it
* $R\circ \varepsilon =R$, i.e. joining the empty string to any string will not change it
* $R\cup \varepsilon$ may not equal $R$
* $R\circ\emptyset$ may not equal $R$

## Equivalence with finite automata
**Brief**. Regular expressions and finite automata are equivalent in their descriptive power
* *Explain*. Any regular expression can be converted into a finite automaton recognizing the language it describes, and vice versa

    $\to$ This is surprising since finite automata and regular expressions superficially appear to be different

### GNFA
**Generalized nondeterministic finite automaton (GNFA)**. NFA, where the transition arrows may have any regular expression as labels, instead of only members of the alphabet or $\varepsilon$
* *Work flow*. The GNFA moves along a transition arrow connecting two states by reading a block of symbols from the input, which constitutes a string described by the regular expression on the arrow
* *Nondeterministicity of GNFA*. A GNFA is nondeterministic, hence may have several different ways to process the same input string
    * *Explain*. The machine accepts its input if its processing can cause the GNFA to be in an accept state at the end of the input
* *Requirements on GNFAs*. For convenience, we require that GNFAs always have a special form satisfying the following conditions
    * The start state has transition arrows going to every other state, but no arrows coming in from any other state
    * There is only a single accept state
    * The accept state has arrows coming in from every other state, but no arrows going to any other state
    * The accept state is not the same as the start state
    * Except for the start state and accept state, one arrows goes from every state to every other state, and also from each state to itself

**Formal defintion of GNFA**. 
* *Assumptions*.
    * $\mathcal{R}$ is the collection of all regular expressions over the alphabet $\Sigma$
* *Formal definition of GNFA*. A GNFA is a 5-tuple $(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_\text{start},q_\text{accept})$ where
    * $Q$ is the finite set of states
    * $\Sigma$ is the input alphabet
    * $\delta:(Q-\{q_\text{accept}\})\times (Q-\{q_\text{start}\})\to\mathcal{R}$ is the transition function
    * $q_\text{start}$ is the start state
    * $q_\text{accept}$ is the accept state
* *Explain*. $\delta$ has its form since an arrow connects every state to every other state, except that no rows are coming from $q_\text{accept}$ or going to $q_\text{start}$

**String accept**. A GNFA accepts a string $w\in\Sigma^*$ if $w=w_1w_2\dots w_k$, where each $w_i\in\Sigma^*$, and a sequence of states $q_0,\dots,q_K$ exists so that
* $q_0=q_\text{start}$ is the start state
* $q_k=q_\text{accept}$ is the accept state
* For each $i$, we have $w_i\in L(R_i)$, where $R_i=\delta(q_{i-1},q_i)$, i.e. the expression on the arrow from $q_{i-1}$ to $q_i$

### Main theorem
**Lemma**. If a language is described by a regular expression, then it is regular
* *Proof idea*. Consider a regular expression $R$ describing some language $A$

    $\to$ We show how to convert $R$ into an NFA recognizing $A$
* *Proof*. There are six cases in the formal definition of a regular expression
    * *Case 1*. $R$ is $a$ for some $a$ in the alphabet $\Sigma$, i.e. $R=\{a\}$

        $\to$ The NFA $N$ with the following state transition table can recognize $R$

        | InState | Input | OutState |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | $q_\text{0}$ | $a$ | $q_1$ |

        where $q_0$ is the start state and $q_1$ is the accept state
    * *Case 2*. $R$ is $\varepsilon$, i.e. empty string

        $\to$ The NFA $N$ with the following state transition table can recognize $R$

        | InState | Input | OutState |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | $q$ | $\varepsilon$ | $q$ |

        where $q$ is both the start and the accept state
    * *Case 3*. $R$ is $\emptyset$

        $\to$ The NFA $N$ with empty transition table and start state $q$ can recognize $R$
    * *Case 4*. $R$ is $(R_1\cup R_2)$, where $R_1$ and $R_2$ are regular expressions

        $\to$ $R$ is regular, due to the closure of regularity under union operation
    * *Case 5*. $R$ is $(R_1\circ R_2)$, where $R_1$ and $R_2$ are regular expressions

        $\to$ $R$ is regular, due to the closure of regularity under concatenation operation
    * *Case 6*. $R$ is $(R_1^*)$, where $R_1$ is a regular expressions

        $\to$ $R$ is regular, due to the closure of regularity under star operation

**Lemma**. If a language is regular, then it can be described by a regular expression
* *Proof idea*. Consider a regular language $A$, since it is accepted by a DFA
    
    $\to$ We describe a procedure for converting DFAs into equivalent regular expressions via two steps
    1. Convert the DFA into a GNFA
    2. Convert the GNFA into a regular expression
* *Conversion from DFA into GNFA in the special form*.
    1. Add a new start state, with $\varepsilon$ arrow to the old start state
    2. Add a new accept state, with $\varepsilon$ arrows from the old accept states
    3. If any two arrows have multiple labels, or if there are multiple arrows going between the same two states in the same direction

        $\to$ Replace each with a single arrow, whose label is the union of the previous one
    4. Add arrows labeled $\emptyset$ between states having no arrows
* *Conversion from GNFA into regular expression*.
    * *Idea*. Consider a GNFA $N$ with $k\geq 2$ states, then we construct an equivalent GNFA with $k-1$ states

        $\to$ The procedure repeats on the new GNFA until it is reduced to two states, i.e. $k=2$
    * *State reduction step*. Select a state $q_\text{rip}$, ripping it out of the machine, and repair the remainder so that the same language is still recognized, i.e.
        1. Select and remove $q_\text{rip}$ from the machine
        2. Repair the machine by altering the regular expressions labeling eahc of the remaining arrows
            * *Idea*. The new labels compensate for the absense of $q_\text{rip}$ by adding back the lost computations
                
                $\to$ The new label going from $q_i$ to $q_j$ is a regular expression describing all strings taking the machine from $_i$ to $q_j$, either directly or via $q_\text{rip}$
    * *Machine repair formulation*.
        * *Assumptions*.
            * $q_i$ going to $q_\text{rip}$ with an arrow labeled $R_1$
            * $q_\text{rip}$ goes to itself with an arrow labeled $R_2$
            * $q_\text{rip}$ goes to $q_j$ with an arrow labeled $R_3$
            * $q_i$ goes to $q_j$ with an arrow labeled $R_4$
        * *New arrow label from $q_i$ to $q_j$*.

            $$(R_1)(R_2)^*(R_3)\cup (R_4)$$

**Theorem**. A language is regular if and only if some regular expression describes it
