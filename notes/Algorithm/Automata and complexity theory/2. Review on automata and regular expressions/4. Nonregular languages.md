# Nonregular languages
**Brief**. To understand the power of finite automata, we must understand their limitations
* *Example*. Consider the language $B=\{0^n1^n:n\geq 0\}$, then if we attempt to find a DFA recognizing $B$

    $\to$ The machine may need to remember how many $0$s have been seen so far as it reads the input
* *Infeasibility of DFAs*. Since the number of $0$s is not limited, the machine will have to keep track of an unlimited number of possibilities

    $\to$ It cannot do so with any finite number of states
* *Proof of nonregularity of $B$*. The fact that the number of $0$s is unlimited does not prove nonregularity of $B$
    * *Explain*. The needs for unbounded memory does not mean it is necessarily nonregular

        $\to$ There are languages requiring an unlimited number of possibilities, yet are regular
    * *Example*. Consider two languages over the alphabet $\Sigma=\{0,1\}$
        
        $$\begin{aligned}
        C&=\{w:w\text{ has an equal number of 0s and 1s}\}\\
        D&=\{w:w\text{ has an equal number of occurrences of 01 and 10 as substrings}\}
        \end{aligned}$$

        $\to$ $C$ is not regular, but $D$ is regular
        * *Proof*. It is easy to have a machine recognizing $D$, i.e. the first and the last inputs must be the same
* *Conclusion*. Our intuition can sometimes lead us astray, hence we need mathematical proofs for certainty

## The pumping lemma for regular languages
**Brief**. Pumping lemma is a theorem for proving nonregularity stems
* *Idea*. All regular languages have a special property, i.e. if we can show that a language does not have this property

    $\to$ We are guaranteed that it is not regular
* *Property of regular languages*. All strings in the language can be pumped if they are at least as long as a certain special value, called the pumping length
    * *Explain*. Each string contains a section, which can be repeated any number of times with the resulting string remaining in the language

**Pumping lemma**.
* *Statement*. If $A$ is a regular language, then there exists a number $p$, i.e. the pumping length, where, if $s$ is any string in $A$ of length at least $p$

    $\to$ $s$ may be divided into three pieces, i.e. $s=xyz$, satisfying the following conditions
    * For each $i\geq 0$, $xy^iz\in A$
    * $|y|>0$, i.e. $y\neq\varepsilon$
    * $|xy|\leq p$
* *Explain*.
    * Without condition 2, the theorem is trivially true
    * Condition 3 is an extra technical condition, which is occasionally useful when proving certain languages to be nonregular
* *Proof idea*. $p$ is the number of states of a DFA $M=(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_1,F)$, which recognizes $A$
    * *Pigeonhole principle*. If $s\in A$ has length $n\geq p$, consider the sequence of states $\mathbf{q}$ gone through by $M$ when computing with inputs $s$

        $\to$ Since $n\geq p$, $|\mathbf{q}|$ has length $n+1>p$, hence $\mathbf{q}$ must contain a repeated state
    * We can dividing $s$ into pieces $x,y,z$, where
        * $x$ is the part of $s$ before the repeated states
        * $y$ is the repeated states
        * $z$ is the remaining part of $s$
    * It is easy to show that the division of $s$ above satisfies all three conditions

**Using pumping lemma to prove that a language $B$ is not regular**.
1. Assume that $B$ is regular to obtain a contradiction
2. Use the pumping lemma to guarantee the existence of a pumping length $p$, so that all strings of length at least $p$ in $B$ can be pumped
3. Find a string $s\in B$ with length at least $p$ but cannot be pumped

    >**NOTE**. Finding $s$ sometimes takes a bit of creative thinking

    * *Hints*. Try members of $B$, which seem to exhibit the essence of $B$'s nonregularity
4. Demonstrate that $s$ cannot be pumped by considering all ways of dividing $s$ into $x,y,z$

    $\to$ For each division, find a value $i$ where $xy^iz\notin B$
    * *Idea*. Group the various ways of dividing $s$ into several cases, and analyze them individually
5. The existence of $s$ contradicts the pumping lemma if $B$ were regular

    $\to$ $B$ cannot be regular

## Summary
**DFA, NFA, GNFA (in special form), and regular expression**. A regular language can be described by DFAs, NFAs, GNFAs, as well as regular expressions, whose relationships are given as
