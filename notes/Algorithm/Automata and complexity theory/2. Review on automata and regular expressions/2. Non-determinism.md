# Non-determinism
**Non-determinism**. A useful concept having great impact on the theory of computation
* *Deterministic computation*. When the machine is in a given state, and reads the next input symbol

    $\to$ The next state is determined
* *Nondeterministic computation*. A genralization of deterministic computation, i.e. every deterministic finite automaton is a nondeterministic finite automaton

**Difference between a DFA and NFA**.
* *State exiting arrows*.
    * Every state of a DFA always has exactly one exiting transition arrow for each symbol in the alphabet
    * A state of a NFA may have zero, one, or many exiting arrows for each alphabet symbol
* *Arrow labels*.
    * In a DFA, labels on the transition arrows are symbols from the alphabet
    * In a NFA, there is a label $\varepsilon$, i.e. zero or more arrows may exit from each state with label $\varepsilon$

**Computation of a NFA**. Consider running an NFA on an input string and coming to a state with multiple ways to proceed
1. After reading the symbol, the machine splits into multiple copies of itself, and follows all the possibilities in parallel
2. Each copy of the machine takes one of the possible ways to proceed and continues as before
    * If there are subsequent choices, the machine splits again
    * If the next input symbol does not appear on any of the arrows exiting the state occupied by a copy

        $\to$ That copy of the machine dies, along with the branch of computation associated with it
    * If a state with an $\varepsilon$ symbol on an exiting arrow is encountered

        $\to$ Without reading any input, the machine splits into multiple copies, one following each of the exiting $\varepsilon$-labeled arrows, and one staying at the current state
3. Finally, if any one of the copies of the machine is in an accept state at the end of the input

    $\to$ The NFA accepts the input string

**Interpretation of NFA**. 
* *NFA as a kind of parallel computation* Multiple independent processes or threads can be running concurrently
    * *Explain*. When the NFA splits to follow several choices

        $\to$ This corresponds to a process forking into several children, each proceeding separately
* *NFA as a tree of possibilities*. 
    * The tree root corresponds to the start of the computation
    * Each branching point corresponds to a point in the computation, where the machine has multiple choices

**Benefits**.
* Every NFA can be converted into an equivalent DFA
* Constructing NFAs is sometimes easier than directly constructing DFAs
* An NFA may be much smaller than its deterministic counterpart, or its functioning may be easier to understand

## Formal definition of a nondeterministic finite automaton
**Brief**. Formal definition of a NFA differs from a DFA in the type of transition function
* *DFA transition function*. Take a state and an input symbol, and produce the next state
* *NFA transition function*. Take a state and an input symbol, or the empty string, and produce the set of possible next states

**Nondeterministic finite automaton**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $\mathcal{P}(Q)$ denotes the power set of $Q$
    * $\Sigma_\varepsilon = \Sigma\cup \{\varepsilon\}$ for any alphabet $\Sigma$
* *Nondeterministic finite automaton*. A 5-tuple $(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F)$, where
    * $Q$ is a finite set of states
    * $\Sigma$ is a finite alphabet
    * $\delta:Q\times \Sigma_\varepsilon\to\mathcal{P}(Q)$ is the transition function
    * $q_0\in Q$ is the start state
    * $F\subseteq Q$ is the set of accept states

**String accept**. A NFA $N=(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F)$ accepts a string $w$ over $\Sigma$ if we can write

$$w=y_1y_2\dots y_m$$

where $y_i\in\Sigma_\varepsilon$, and a sequence of states $r_0r_1\dots r_m$ exists in $Q$ with three conditions
* $r_0=q_0$
* $r_{i+1}\in\delta(r_i,y_{i+1})$, for $i=0,\dots,m-1$
* $r_m\in F$

## Equivalence of NFAs and DFAs
**NFAs versus DFAs**. Deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata recognize the same class of languages

$\to$ This is both surprising and useful
* *Explain*.
    * It is surprising since NFAs appear to have more power than DFAs, i.e. we expect NFAs to recognize more languages
    * It is useful since describing an NFA for a given language is sometimes much easier than using a DFA

**Equivalent machines**. Two machines are equivalent if they recognize the same language

**Theorem**. Every NFA has an equivalent DFA
* *Proof idea*. If a language is recognized by an NFA, we must show the existence of a DFA recognizing it

    $\to$ We  convert the NFA into an equivalent DFA simulating it
    * *Simulation idea*. We need to keep track various branches of the computation by placing a finger on each state, which could be activate at given points in the input

        $\to$ We updated the simulation by moving, adding, and removing fingers according to the way the NFA operates
    * *Number of states of the NFA*. $2^k $ subsets of states, where $k$ is the number of states of the NFA

        $\to$ Each subset corresponds to a possibility that the DFA must remember
* *Consequence*. Every NFA can be converted into an equivalent DFA

    $\to$ NFA give an alternative way of characterizing the regular languages

**Corollary**. A language is regular if and only if some NFA recognizes it
