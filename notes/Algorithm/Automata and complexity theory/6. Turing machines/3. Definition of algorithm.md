# Definition of algorithm
**Informal definition of algorithm (or procedures or recipes)**. A collection of simple instructions for carrying out some task
* *Algorithms and mathematics*. Algorithms play an important role in mathematics
    * *Example*. Ancient mathematical literature contains descriptions of algorithms for a variety of tasks, e.g. finding prime numbers and greatest common divisors

## Hilbert's problems
**Brief**. In 1900, mathematician David Hilbert delivered a now-famous address at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris

$\to$ In his lecture, he identified twenty-three mathematical problems and posed them as a challenge fr the coming century

**Hilbert's tenth problem**. Devise an algorithm to test whether a polynomial has an integral root
* *Definition of algorithm by Hilbert*. A process, according to which it can be determined by a finite number of operations

    $\to$ Hilbert explicitly asked that an algorithm should be devised
* *Existence of solution*. No algorithm exists for this task, i.e. it is algorithmically unsolvable

    $\to$ For mathematicians of that period, to come to this conclusion with their intuitive concept of algorithm would be virtually impossible
    * *Explain*. The intuitive concept may have been adequate for giving algorithms for certain tasks, but it was useless for showing that no algorithm exists for a particular task

**Alonzo Church and Alan Turing's 1936 papers**. Church used a notation system called $\lambda$-calculus to define algorithms, while Turing used his machines

$\to$ The two definitions are shown to be equivalent, i.e. the precise definition has come to be called the Church-Turing thesis

**Church-Turing thesis**. Provide the definition of algorithm necessary to resolve Hilbert's tenth problem
* *Statement*. Intuitive notion of algorithms equals Turing machine algorithms

**Solving Hilbert's tenth problem with Church-Turing thesis**.
* *Mathematical modeling*. Consider

    $$D=\{p:p\text{ is a polynomial with an integral root}\}$$

    then Hilbert's tenth problem asks whether $D$ is decidable
* *Answer*. The answer is negative, i.e. $D$ is not decidable, yet it is Turing-recognizable
* *Simplified problem*. Consider

    $$D_1=\{p:p\text{ is a polyonmial over }x\text{ with an integral root}\}$$

* *Construction of a TM $M_1$ recognizing $D_1$*. 
    * *Informal definition of $M$*. Given a polynomial $p$ over $x$ as input
        1. Evaluate $p$ with $x$ set successively to $0,1,-1,2,-2,\dots$
        2. If at any point, the polynomial evaluates to $0$, accept
    * *Recognizability of $D_1$ by $M_1$*. If $p$ has an integral root, $M_1$ eventually will find it and accept, i.e. recognizability

        $\to$ Otherwise, $M_1$ will run forever, i.e. undecidability

## Terminology for describing Turing machines
**Brief**. We have come to a turning point in the study of the theory of computation, i.e. we continue speaking of TMs, but focus on algorithms

$\to$ TM merely serves as a precise model for the definition of algorithm
* *Consequence*. We skip the extensive theory of TMs and do not spend much time on the low-level programming of TMs

    $\to$ We only need to be comfortable with TMs to believe that they capture all algorithms

**Standardized way to describe TM algorithms**.
* *What is the right level of detail to give when describing TM algorithms*.
    * *Case 1*. The formal description spelling out in full the TM's states, transition function, etc.

        $\to$ This is the lowest, most detailed, level of description
    * *Case 2*. The implementation description, i.e. use English prose to describe the way that the TM moves its head and the way it stores data on its tape

        $\to$ We do not give details of stages or transition function
    * *Case 3*. The high-level description, i.e. use English prose to describe an algorithm, ignoring the implementation details

        $\to$ We do not need to mention how the TM manages its tape or head
* *Recommended level of details*.
    1. Practice with lower level TM descriptions helps understanding TMs and gain confidence in using them
    2. Once felt confident, high-level descriptions are sufficient
* *Format and notation for describing TMs*.
    * *Input to a TM*. Always a string, i.e. if we want to provide an object other than a string as input

        $\to$ We must represent the object as a string
        * *Explain*. A TM can be programmed to decode the representation so that it can be interpreted in the desired way
        * *Notation*. 
            * $\langle O\rangle$ denotes the encoding of an object $O$
            * $\langle O_1,\dots,O_k\rangle$ denotes the encoding of $O_1,\dots,O_k$
    * *TM algorithms*. Described with an indented segment of text within quotes
        * *Algorithm stages*. The algorithm is broken into stages, each usually involving many individual steps of the TM's computation
        * *Algorithm block*. We indicate the block structure of the algorithm with further indentation
         *Algorithm input*. Described in the first line
    * *Input checking*.
        * If the input is $w$, the input is a string
        * If the input is $\langle A\rangle$, the TM first implicitly tests whether the input properly encodes an object of the desired form, and rejects if it does not
