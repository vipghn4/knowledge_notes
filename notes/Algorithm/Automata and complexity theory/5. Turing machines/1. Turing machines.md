# Turing machines
**Turing machine**. A much more powerful model than DFAs, i.e. it is a DFA but with an unlimited and unrestricted memory

$\to$ A Turing machine is a much more accurate model of a general-purpose computer
* *Capabilities*. A TM can do everything a real computer can do

    >**NOTE**. Even a TM cannot solve certain problems, which are beyond the theoretical limits of computation

* *Memory tape*. A TM uses an infinite tape as its unlimited memory, and a tape head, which can read and write symbols and move around on the tape
    * *Initial tape content*. Contain only the input string and blank everywhere else
    * *Read and write operations*. 
        * *Write operation*. To store information, the machine writes the information on the tape
        * *Read operation*. To read written information, the machine moves its head back over it
* *Computing operation*. The machine continues computing until it decides to produce an output
    * *Output acceptance and rejection*. The outputs accept and reject are obtained by entering designated accepting and rejecting states

        $\to$ If it does not enter an accepting or rejecting state, it will go on forever without halting

## Formal definition of a Turing machine
**Transition function $\delta$**. The heart of the definition of a TM, i.e. $\delta$ tells us how the machine behaves
* *Transition function format*. $\delta:Q\times \Gamma\to Q\times\Gamma\times\{L,R\}$
    * *Interpretation*. When the machine is in a state $q$, and the head is over a tape square containing a symbol $a$, and if $\delta(q,a)=(r,b,L)$

        $\to$ The machine writes $b$ replacing $a$, and goes to state $r$, then the head moves to the left after writing

**Turing machine**. A 7-tuple $(Q,\Sigma,\Gamma,\delta,q_0,q_\text{accept},q_\text{reject})$, where $Q,\Sigma,\Gamma$ are finite sets
* $Q$ is the set of states
* $\Sigma$ is the input alphabet not containing the blank symbol $\sqcup$
* $\Gamma$ is the tape alphabet, where $\sqcup\in\Gamma$ and $\Sigma\subseteq\Gamma$
* $delta:Q'\times\Gamma\to Q\times\Gamma\times\{L,R\}$ is the transition function, where $Q'=Q-\{q_\text{start},q_\text{reject}\}$
* $q_0\in Q$ is the start state
* $q_\text{start}\in Q$ is the accept state
* $q_\text{reject}\noteq q_\text{start}\in Q$ is the reject state

**Behavior of a TM**. A TM $M=(Q,\Sigma,\Gamma,\delta,q_0,q_\text{accept},q_\text{reject})$ computes as follows
1. $M$ intially receives input $w=w_1 w_2\dots w_n\in\Sigma^*$ on the left most $n$ squares of the tape

    $\to$ The rest of the tape is blank, i.e. filled with $\sqcup$ symbols
2. The head starts on the leftmost square of the tape

    >**NOTE**. $\Sigma$ does not contain $\sqcup$, hence the first $\sqcup$ on the tape marks the end of the input

3. Once started, the computation of $M$ proceeds according to the rules described by the transition function
    
    >**NOTE**. If $M$ tries to move its head to the left off the left-hand end of the tape
    >
    >$\to$ The head stays in the same place for the move, even though $\delta$ indicates $L$

4. The computation continues until it enters either the accept or reject states, at which it halts

    $\to$ If neither occurs, $M$ goes on forever

**TM configuration**. As a TM computes, changes occur in the current state, the current tape contents, and the current head location

$\to$ A setting of these items is a configuration of the TM
* *Representation of configurations*. For a state $q$ and two strings $u,v\in\Gamma^*$

    $\to$ $uqv$ denotes the configuration where the current state is $q$, the current tape contents is $uv$, and the current head location is the first symbol of $v$
* *Yielding configurations*. Configuration $C_1$ yields configuration $C_2$ if the TM can legally go from $C_1$ to $C_2$ in one step, i.e.
    * *Assumptions*.
        * $a,b,c\in\Gamma$ are symbols
        * $u,v\in\Gamma^*$ are strings
        * $q_i,q_j\in Q$ are states
    * *Ordinary cases*.
        * *Left move*. $uaq_ibv$ yields $uq_jacv$  if $\delta(q_i,b)=(q_j,c,L)$
        * *Right move*. $uaq_ibv$ yields $uacq_jv$ if $\delta(q_i,b)=(q_j,c,R)$
    * *Special cases*. Occur when the head is at one of the ends of the configuration
        * *Left move*. $q_ibv$ yields $q_jcv$ if $\delta(q_i,b)$ results in a left move, otherwise yields $cq_jv$
        * *Right move*. $uaq_i$ is equivalent to $uaq_i\sqcup$, i.e. there is no right end
* *Special configurations*.
    * *Start configuration of $M$ on input $w$*. $q_0w$, i.e. $M$ is in state $q_0$ with its head at the leftmost position on the tape
    * *Accepting configuration*. The state of the configuration is $q_\text{accept}$
    * *Rejecting configuration*. The state of the configuration is $q_\text{reject}$
    * *Halting configurations*. Accepting and rejecting configurations

**Input processing by a TM**.
* *Acceptance of inputs*. A TM $M$ accepts input $w$ if a sequence of configurations $C_1,\dots,C_k$ exists, where
    * $C_1$ is the start configuration of $M$ on $w$
    * Each $C_i$ yields $C_{i+1}$
    * $C_k$ is an accepting configuration
* *Language of a TM (or language recognized by $M$)*. The collection $L(M)$ of strings accepted by $M$
    * *Turing-recognizable language*. A language, which can be recognized by some TM
* *Possible outcomes when starting a TM on an input*. Accept, reject, or loop
    
    $\to$ A TM $M$ can fail to accept an input by entering $q_\text{reject}$ and rejecting, or by looping
* *Deciders*. Sometimes, distinguishing a looping TM from one, which is merely taking a long time, is difficult

    $\to$ We prefer TMs, which halt on all inputs, i.e. deciders
    * *"Decider"*. The TM always make a decision to accept or reject
    * *Recognizing and deciding*. A decider, which recognizes a language $L$, is said to decide $L$

        $\to$ Every decidable language is Turing-recognizable
* *Turing-decidable (or decidable) language*. A language, which can be decided by some TM

**Example**. Consider a TM $M$ deciding $A=\{0^{2^n}:n\geq 0\}$
* *Informal description of $M$*. On input string $w$, $M$ behaves as follows
    1. Sweep left to right across the tape, crossing off every other $0$
    2. If in stage $1$, and the stape contained a stingle $0$, accept
    3. If in stage $1$, and the tape contained more than a single $0$, and the number of $0$s was odd, reject
    4. Return the head to the left-hand end of the tape
    5. Go to stage 1
* *Interpretation*.
    * Each iteration of stage 1 cuts the number of $0$s in half
    * As the machine sweeps across the tape in stage 1, it keeps track of whether the number of $0$s seen is even or odd
        * If the number if odd and greater than $1$, the original number of $0$s could not have been a power of $2$, hence reject
        * If the number of $0$s seen is $1$, the original number must have been a power of $2$, hence accept
* *Formal description of $M$*. $M=(Q,\Sigma,\Gamma,\delta,q_1,q_\text{accept},q_\text{reject})$ where
    * $Q=\{q_1,q_2,q_3,q_4,q_5,q_\text{accept},q_\text{reject}\}$
    * $\Sigma=\{0\}$
    * $\Gamma=\{0,x,\sqcup\}$
    * $\delta$ is given as

        </div>

    * The start, accept, and reject states are $q_1,q_\text{accept},q_\text{reject}$

**Finding the left-hand end of the tape**. 
* *Option 1*. The TM marks the leftmost symbol in some way when the machine starts with its head on that symbol

    $\to$ The TM may then scan left until it finds the mark when it wants to reset its head to the left-hand end
* *Option 2*. Exploit the way we define the TM model, i.e. if a TM tries to move its head beyond the left-hand end of the tape, it stays in the same place
    * *Left-hand end detector*. The TM writes a special symbol over the current position, while recording the symbol that it replaced in the control

        $\to$ The TM can then attempt to move the head to the left
        * If it is still over the special symbol, the leftward move did not succeed, and the head must have been at the left-end end
        * Otherwise, some symbols remained to the left of the position on the tape

        >**NOTE**. Before going further, the machine must be sure to restore the changed symbol to the original one

**Marking tape symbols**. The TM places a mark above a symbol by having two different symbols in its tape alphabet, i.e. marked and unmarked
* *Placing a mark on a symbol*. Write the corresponding marked symbol at the location
* *Removing a mark on a symbol*. Write the corresponding unmarked symbol at the location
