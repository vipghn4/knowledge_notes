# State minimization
## Distinguishable in indistinguishable states
**Distinguishable strings**. Consider a language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$, then two strings $x,y$ are distinguishable w.r.t $L$ if

$$\exists z,xz\in L\land yz\notin L$$

or vice versa, where $z$ is a string
* *Example*. Consider the language $\text{EQ}=\{0^n1^n:n\geq 1\}$, then
    * $x=0$ and $y=00$ are distinguishable
    * $x=0110$ and $y=10$ are not distinguishable, since

        $$\forall z,xz\notin \text{EQ}\land yz\notin \text{EQ}$$
* *Interpretation 1 - Path integral*. $L$ partitions $\Sigma^*$ into $L$ and $\Sigma^*-L$, one of which contains $xz$ and the other contains $yz$
    * *Distinguishable strings*. Starting from $x$ and $y$, walking along some direction $z$, the destinations $xz$ and $yz$ are in the different region, i.e. either $L$ or $\Sigma^* - L$
    * *Indistinguishable strings*. Starting from $x$ and $y$, walking along any direction $z$ will result in destinations $xz$ and $yz$ both in the same region
* *Interpretation 2 - Pattern matching*. Let $\tau(x)=\{xz:z\in\Sigma^*\}$ be the set of possible locations reachable from $x$, e.g. think of it as a region
    
    $\to$ $x$ and $y$ are indistinguishable if both regions intersects $L$ in the same way, i.e.

    $$\{z:z\in\Sigma^*\land xz\in L\}=\{z:z\in\Sigma^*\land yz\in L\}$$

    and 

    $$\{z:z\in\Sigma^*\land xz\not\in L\}=\{z:z\in\Sigma^*\land yz\not\in L\}$$
    
    * *Analogy in computer vision*. Two key points are indistinguishable if their local patterns are the same

        $\to$ Distinguishability is about locality of strings
    * *Consequence*. We can understand an equivalence classes in $\Sigma^*$ w.r.t $\approx_L$ (defined below) as a set of similar local patterns

        $\to$ The set of all different patterns recognizable by $L$ forms defines the set of equivalence classes in $\Sigma^*$ w.r.t $\approx_L$

**Lemma**.
* *Assumptions*.
    * $L$ is a language
    * $M$ is a DFA deciding $L$
    * $x,y$ are distinguishable strings w.r.t $L$
* *Conclusion*. The state reached by $M$ on input $x$ is different from the state reached by $M$ on input $y$
* *Proof*. Under the interpretation of distinguishable strings above, since $M(xz,q_0)\in F$ and $M(yz,q_0)\notin F$, and we both take the same trajectory $z$ starting from $x$ and $y$

    $\to$ $M(x,q_0)$ and $M(y,q_0)$ must be different

**Distinguishable set of strings**. Consider $L$ is a language, then a set $X=\{x_1,\dots,x_k\}$ are distinguishable w.r.t $L$ if every two different strings $x_i,x_j\in X$ are distinguishable

**Lemma**. This lemma follows directly from the previous lemma
* *Assumptions*.
    * $L$ is a language
    * There is a set of $k$ distinguishable strings w.r.t $L$
* *Conclusion*. Every DFA for $L$ has at least $k$ states
* *Interpretation*. $L$ defines $k$ different descriptive local patterns

    $\to$ The minimial DFA recognizing $L$ has the number of states equal to the number of descriptive local patterns defined by $L$

## State minimization
**Indistinguishable strings**. Consider a language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$, then two strings $x,y$ are indistinguishable, i.e. $x\approx_L y$, if they are not distinguishable
* *Formal*.

    $$x\approx_L y\implies \forall z,(xz\in L\Leftrightarrow yz\in L)$$

* *Properties*. 
    * $x\approx_L y\Leftrightarrow y\approx_L x$
    * $x\approx_L x$
    * $x\approx_L y\land y\approx_L w\implies x\approx_L w$
* *Conclusion*. $\approx_L$ is an equivalence relationship over the strings in $\Sigma^*$

**Equivalence relation over a set**. Define a way to partition the set into a collection of subsets, i.e. equivalence class
* *The equivalence class in $\Sigma^*$ w.r.t $\approx_L$*. A set of strings, which are
    * Indistinguishable from one another
    * Distinguishable from all others not in the set
* *Consequence*. Every DFA for $L$ must have at least as many states as the number of equivalence class in $\Sigma^*$ w.r.t $\approx_L$

**Myhill-Nerode theorem**.
* *Statement*. Consider a language $L$ over $\Sigma$
    * If $\Sigma^*$ has infinitely many equivalence classes w.r.t $\approx_L$, then $L$ is not regular
    * Otherwise, $L$ can be decided by a DFA, whose number of states is equal to the number of equivalence classes in $\Sigma^*$ w.r.t $\approx_L$
* *Proof*. The first proposition is obvious, hence it suffices to prove the second proposition only
    * Consider a DFA $M=(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F)$ recognizing $L$ and another DFA $M'=(Q',\Sigma,\delta',q'_0,F')$, which is constructed as following
        * For $L$ to be recognized by $M$, it suffices that any string $x\in L$ will results in a sequence of states $r_0,\dots,r_n$, where $r_0=q_0$ and $r_n\in F$

            $\to$ There is no need to consider $r_1,\dots,r_{n-1}$
        * Due to the definition of state equivalence (below), it suffices to group up $p,q$ into a single state, while keeping the recognizability of any string $z$ starting from $p$ or $q$

            $\to$ Recursively, it suffices to group up $p$ and its equivalent states into a single state $[p]$, and repeat for other states as well
        * Finally, $Q'$ consists of a state for each of the equivalence classes of $Q$
        * $\delta'$ is defined respectively as $\delta'([p],a)=[\delta(p,a)]$
    * It is easily shown that $M'$ can recognize any string in $L$, just as $M$
* *Consequence*. We can use the distinguishability method to prove optimal lower bounds on the number of states of a DFA for a given language

    >**NOTE**. The theorem does not give an efficient way to construct an optimal DFA

### Polynomial-time algorithm for finding optimal DFA
**Equivalence of states**. Consider a DFA $M=(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F)$, then two states $p,q\in Q$ are equivalent, i.e. $p\equiv q$ if

$$\forall x\in\Sigma^*,M(p,x)\in F\Leftrightarrow M(q,x)\in F$$
* *Explain*. If we change $M$ so that $p$ is the start state, the language recognized is the same as if we change $M$ so that $q$ is the start state
* *Interpretation*. If we interpret $p$ as $M(x_p,q_0)$ and $q$ and $M(x_q,q_0)$

    $\to$ The equivalence of states $p$ and $q$ is the same as the equivalence of strings $x_p$ and $x_q$ 
* *Conclusion*. $\equiv$ is an equivalence relation among $Q$, hence partitioning $Q$ into a set of equivalence classes

**Key idea for finding optimal DFA**. If $p\equiv q$, then it is redundant to have both of them
* *Motivation*. Follow directly from Myhill-Nerode theorem
* *Steps to find optimal DFA*.
    1. Compute the set of equivalence classes of $Q$ w.r.t $\equiv$
    2. Construct a new automaton with only one state for each equivalence class
* *Problem*. It is not clear how to compute the relation $\equiv$, since it looks like we need to test infinitely many cases to verify $p\equiv q$

**Equivalence for length**. Consider a DFA $M=(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F)$, then $p,q\in Q$ are equivalent for length $n$, i.e. $p\equiv_n q$, if

$$\forall x\in\{x:|x|\leq n,x\in \Sigma^*\},M(p,x)\in F\Leftrightarrow M(q,x)\in F$$

* *Interpretation*. Consider the previous interpretation of equivalence of states, then $p \equiv_n q$ is the same as $x_p\equiv x_q$, except that we consider only those strings $z$ with length $|z|\leq n$

**Lemma**. Consider a DFA $M=(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F)$, then for any $p,q\in Q$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}_+$, we have

$$p\not\equiv_n q\Leftrightarrow (p\not\equiv_{n-1} q)\lor [\exists a\in \Sigma, \delta(p,a)\not\equiv_{n-1}\delta(q,a)]$$

* *Proof*. Easy to prove

**Computation of equivalence relations $\equiv_n$**. Use recursion
* *Initialization*. $p\not\equiv_0 q\Leftrightarrow p\in F\land q\notin F$ (or vice versa)

    $\to$ The equivalence classes for $\equiv_0$ are $F$ and $Q-F$
* *Iteration*. Given $\equiv_{n-1}$, then $p\equiv_n q$ if and only if $p\equiv_{n-1} q$, and

    $$\forall a\in \Sigma,\delta(p,a)\equiv_{n-1}\delta(q,a)$$

* *Time complexity*. $O(|\Sigma|\cdot |Q|)$ is required to compute $\equiv_n$ given $\equiv_{n-1}$

    $\to$ $O(n\cdot |\Sigma|\cdot|Q|)$ is required to compute $\equiv_n$ from scratch

**Convergence of the algorithm**. 
* *Theorem*. For some $k$, if $\equiv_k$ is the same as $\equiv_{k+1}$, then $\equiv_k$ is the same as $\equiv_n$ for all $n>k$
    * *Proof idea*. The process used to go from $\equiv_k$ to $\equiv_{k+1}$ is independent of $k$
    * *Proof*. $\delta$ is closed under each equivalence class, given the partition defined by $\equiv_k$

        $\to$ This leads to closure of $\delta$ under $\equiv_n$ for all $n>k$
* *Convergence of the algorithm*. The algorithm converges to a fixed partition in $\leq |Q|-1$ steps
    * *Explain*. 
        * It starts with two equivalence classes, hence it cannot create more than $|Q|$ equivalence classes
        * At each step, it must either increase the number of equivalence classes, or reach the final partition
    * *Consequence*. The algorithm can be computed in time at most $O(|Q|^2\cdot |\Sigma|)$

**Equivalence of $\equiv$ and $\equiv_{|Q|-1}$**. 
* *Statement*. $\equiv_{|Q|-1}$ is the same as $\equiv$, i.e.
    * If $p\equiv q$ then $p\equiv_{|Q|-1} q$
    * If $p\not\equiv q$, then there is a string $x$ with length $n$ showing that $p\not\equiv q$, hence $p\not\equiv_n q$

**State minimization algorithm**.
* *Procedure*. Consider a DFA $M=(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F)$
    1. Let $k=|Q|-1$ and compute the equivalence classes of $Q$ w.r.t $\equiv_k$
    2. Define a new automaton $M'=(Q',\Sigma,\delta',q_0',F')$ as following
        * There is a state in $Q'$ for each equivalence class
        * $q_0'$ is the equivalence class $[q_0]$
        * $F'$ contains all the equivalence classes containing the final states in $F$
        * $\delta'([q],a)=[\delta(q,a)]$
    3. Remove from $Q'$ all states unreachable from $q'_0$, i.e. this can be done using DFS, resulting in a new DFA $M''=(Q'',\Sigma,\delta'',q_0',F'')$
        * *Correctness*. The removal of these states does not change the language accepted by automaton
            * *Explain*. They never occur in a computation
