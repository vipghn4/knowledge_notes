# Decidable language
**Brief**. This chapter investigates the power of algorithms to solve problems, i.e. we demonstrate certain problems can be solved algorithmically and others that cannot

$\to$ The objective is to explore the limits of algorithmic solvability
* *Needs for studying unsolvability*.
    * Knowing when a problem is algorithmically unsolvable is useful
        * *Explain*. We realize that the problem must be simplified or altered before being able to find an algorithmic solution

            $\to$ Like any tool, computers have capabilities and limitations which must be appreciated if they are to be used well
    * Cultural reasons, i.e. even if we deal with clearly solvable problems

        $\to$ A glimpse of the unsolvable can stimulate our imagination and help us gain an important perspective on computation

**Section introduction**. This section focuses on languages concerning automata and grammars
* *Context-free language (CFL)*. Interesting for several reasons
    * Certain problems related to CFL are related to application
        * *Example*. Testing whether a CFL generates a string is related to the problem of recognizing and compiling programs in a programming language
    * Certain other problems concerning automata and grammars are not decidable by algorithms

## Decidable problems concerning regular languages
**Brief**. We begin with certain computational problems concerning finite automata, i.e. we give algorithms for testing 
* Whether a finite automaton accepts a string
* Whether the language of a finite automaton is empty
* Whether two finite automata are equivalent

**Computational problem representation using languages**. This representation is convenient, since we already set up terminology for dealing with languages

### Acceptance problem
**Acceptance problem for DFAs**. Test whether a DFA accepts a given string
* *Language representation of the problem*. The language contains the encodings of all DFAs and the strings that the DFAs accept, i.e.

    $$A_\text{DFA}=\{\langle B,w\rangle:B\text{ is a DFA accepting input string }w\}$$

    * *Explain*. Testing whether a DFA $B$ accepts an input $w$ is equivalent to testing whether $\langle B,w\rangle$ is a member of $A_\text{DFA}$
    * *Consequence*. Showing that $A_\text{DFA}$ is decidable is equivalent to showing that the computational problem is decidable

**Theorem**. $A_\text{DFA}$ is a decidable language
* *Proof*. Given an input $\langle B,w\rangle$, we write the string representation of $B$ to the tape, followed by a special symbol `#`, then followed by $w$
    * *String representation of $B$*. 
        * We represent the transition function $\delta_B$ of $B$ as a table, then flatten it to a string $\sigma(\delta_B)$, then write it to the tape
        * For each accept state, we mark each of its occurrence in $\sigma(\delta_B)$ with a special symbol `<accept>`
        * For each reject state, we mark each of its occurrence similarly
    * *State space of the TM*. $(q,w,y)$, where 
        * $q$ is the current state of $B$
        * $w$ is the current input symbol if $y=1$, otherwise last input symbol
        * $y=1$ indicates that the TM should go to the square containing the next input symbol to read the latest input symbol in order to proceed
            
            $\to$ Otherwise the TM has read the latest input and is ready to proceed

**Theorem**. Consider the similar language for NFAs

$$A_\text{NFA}=\{\langle B,w\rangle:B\text{ is an NFA accepting input string }w\}$$

then $A_\text{NFA}$ is a decidable language
* *Proof*. Given an input $\langle B,w\rangle$, convert $B$ to an equivalent DFA then back to the previous theorem

**Theorem**. Consider the similar language for regular expression

$$A_\text{REX}=\{\langle R,w\rangle:R\text{ is a RE generating string }w\}$$

then $A_\text{REX}$ is a decidable language
* *Proof*. Given an input $\langle R,w\rangle$, convert $R$ to an equivalent DFA then back to the previous theorem

**Corollary**. For decidability purposes, presenting the TM with a DFA, NFA, or RE are all equivalent, since the TM can convert one form of encoding to another

### Emptiness testing
**Emptiness testing for the language of finite automaton**. Determine whether a finite automaton accepts any string at all

**Theorem**. Consider the language

$$E_\text{DFA}=\{\langle A\rangle:A\text{ is a DFA and }L(A)=\emptyset\}$$

then $E_\text{DFA}$ is a decidable language
* *Idea*. $L(A)\neq\emptyset$ if BFS or DFS from any start state of $A$ will not reach any accept state
* *Proof*. Construct a TM which can DFS from each of the start states of a given DFA

### Equivalence testing
**Equivalence testing for DFAs**. Determine whether two DFAs recognize the same language

**Theorem**. Consider the language

$$\text{EQ}_\text{DFA}=\{\langle A,B\rangle:A,B\text{ are DFAs and }L(A)=L(B)\}$$

then $\text{EQ}_\text{DFA}$ is a decidable language
* *Idea*. Construct a DFA $C$ from $A$ and $B$ where

    $$L(C)=[L(A)-L(B)]\cup [L(B)-L(A)]$$

    then by the previous theorem, it follows that $\text{EQ}_\text{DFA}$ is decidable
* *Existence of $C$*. Since regular languages are closed under complementation, union, and intersection

    $\to$ $L(C)$ is regular, hence $C$ exists

## Decidable problems concerning context-free languages
**Brief**. This section describes algorithms to determine whether a CFG generates a particular string, and to determine whether the language of a CFG is empty

**Lemma**. If a CFG $G$ is in CNF, then any derivation of a string $w$ generated by $G$ has $2|w|-1$ steps
* *Proof*. Prove by induction
    * *Assumption*. 
        * For any string $w=w_1\dots w_n$ of length $n$, let $w_{i:j}=w_i\dots w_j$ be one of its substring
        * $t(w)$ is a parse tree resulting in $w$ 
    * *Base case*. For $w_{1:1}=1$, the lemma obviously holds
    * *Inductive case*. Assuming that $w_{1:k}$ can be represented by a derivation of $2k-1$ steps
        * $t(w_{1:k+1})$ can be constructed by taking the parent $l$ of the right-most leaf node of $t(w_{1:k})$
            
            $\to$ $l$ represents a rule of the form $A\to a$
        * Replace $l$ by a node representing the rule $A\to BC$, which takes no additional number of steps
        * Apply two rules $B\to w_k$ and $C\to w_{k+1}$ and yield $w_{1:k+1}$, which additionally takes two steps

            $\to$ It takes $2k+1$ steps to generate $w_{1:k+1}$ from $G$

**Acceptance testing**.Consider a language

$$A_\text{CFG}=\{\langle G,w\rangle:G\text{ is a CFG generating }w\}$$

then $A_\text{CFG}$ is a decidable language
* *Proof for recognizability of $A_\text{CFG}$*. Given $\langle G,w\rangle$, let $G$ go through all derivations to determine whether any is a derivation of $w$

    $\to$ If $G$ does not generate $w$, the algorithm will never halt, since there are infinitely many derivations
    * *Consequence*. $A_\text{CFG}$ is recognizable by a TM
* *Proof for decidability of $A_\text{CFG}$*. Given $\langle G,w\rangle$, convert $G$ to CNF, then check derivations with $2|w|-1$ steps to determine whether $G$ generates $w$

    $\to$ $A_\text{CFG}$ is decidable
* *Usage*. Used in compiling programming languages

**Emptiness testing** Consider a language

$$E_\text{CFG}=\{\langle G\rangle:G\text{ is a CFG and }L(G)=\emptyset\}$$

then $E_\text{CFG}$ is a decidable language
* *Idea*. Check if the start variable can can generate a string of terminals
* *TM deciding $E_\text{CFG}$*. On input $\langle G\rangle$
    1. Mark all terminal symbols in $G$
    2. Mark any variable $A$ where $G$ has rule $A\to U_1\dots U_k$ and $U_i$ has already been marked for $1\leq i\leq k$
    3. Repeat until no new variables get marked
    4. If the start variable is not marked, accept, otherwise reject

**Equivalence testing**. Consider a language

$$\text{EQ}_\text{CFG}=\{\langle G,H\rangle:G,H\text{ are CFGs and }L(G)=L(H)\}$$

then $\text{EQ}_\text{CFG}$ is not decidable

**Theorem**. Every context-free language is decidable by a TM
* *Consequence*. The following relationship among classes of languages is established
