# Halting problem
**Brief**. This section proves one of the most philosophically important theorems of the theory of computation
* *Statement*. There is a specific problem, which is algorithmically unsolvable
* *Consequence*. Computers are limited in a fundamental way

**Software verification problem**. An unsolvable problem
* *Task*. Given a computer program and a precise specification of what the program is supposed to do

    $\to$ We need to verify that the program performs as specified
* *Solution*. The general problem of software verification is unsolvable by computer

**Halting problem of a TM**. Determine whether a TM $A_\text{TM}$ accepts a given input string
* *Theorem*. Consider $A_\text{TM}=\{\langle M,w\rangle:M\text{ is a TM accepting }w\}$, then $A_\text{TM}$ is undecidable yet recognizable
* *Proof*. Prove below
* *Consequence*. Recognizers are more powerful than deciders
* *"Halting"*. Indicate the problem of determining if an algorithm can halt

**Universal TM**. Capable of simulating any other TM from the description of that TM

$\to$ This plays an important early role in stimulating the development of stored-program computers
* *Informal description*. On input $\langle M,w\rangle$, where $M$ is a TM and $w$ is a string
    1. Simulate $M$ on $w$
    2. If $M$ enters its accept state, accept, otherwise if $M$ enters its reject state, reject

>**NOTE**. $U$ loops on input $\langle M,w\rangle$ if $M$ loops on $w$, hence $U$ does not decide $A_\text{TM}$

## Diagonalization method
**Brief**. The proof of undecidability of the halting problem uses diagonalization technique, which is discovered by mathematician Georg Cantor in 1873
* *Measurement of infinite sets*. If we have two infinite sets, how can we tell whether one is larger than the other, or if they are of the same size
* *Observation*. Two finite sets have the same size if the elements of one set can be paired with the elements of the other set

    $\to$ This method compares the size without resorting to counting

**Countable set**. A set $A$ is countable if it is either finite or has the same size as $\mathbf{N}$

$\to$ $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable
* *Applications to theory of computation*. Some languages are not decidable or even Turing-recognizable, i.e.
    * There are uncountably many languages yet only countably many Turing machines
    * One TM can recognize one language

**Theorem**. Some languages are not Turing-recognizable
* *Proof for countability of TMs*.
    * The set of all strings $\Sigma^*$ is countable for any $\Sigma$
        * *Explain*. There are finitely many strings of each length from $\Sigma^*$
    * Each TM $M$ has an encoding into a string $\langle M\rangle$

        $\to$ The list of all TMs is countable
* *Proof for uncountability of the set of all languages*.
    * The set $\mathcal{B}$ of all infinite binary sequences, i.e. unending sequences of zeros and ones, is uncountable
    * Consider the set $\mathcal{L}$ of all languages over alphabet $\Sigma$, we have $|\mathcal{L}|=|\mathcal{B}|$

        $\to$ $\mathcal{L}$ is uncountable

## Halting problem is undecidable
**Proof idea for halting problem on TMs**. Consider a TM $M$ and another TM $D$

$$D(\langle M\rangle)=\begin{cases}
\text{accept} & M\text{ does not accept }\langle M\rangle\\
\text{reject} & M\text{ accepts }\langle M\rangle
\end{cases}$$

then we have $D(\langle D\rangle)$ is an infinite loop, i.e. $A_\text{TM}$ is not decidable

## A Turing-unrecognizable language
**Brief**. If both a language and its complement are Turing-recognizable, then the language is decidable

$\to$ For any undecidable language, either it or its complement is not Turing-recognizable

**Co-Turing-recognizable language**. A language whose complement is Turing-recognizable

**Theorem**. A language is decidable if it is Turing-recognizable or co-recognizable
* *Proof*. Easy to prove

**Corollary**. $\bar{A}_\text{TM}$ is not Turing-recognizable, i.e. since $A_\text{TM}$ is undecidable
