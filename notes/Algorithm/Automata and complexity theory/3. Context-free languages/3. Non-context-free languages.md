# Non-context-free languages
**Brief**. This section presents a technique for proving that a certain languages are not context free

## The pumping lemma for context-free languages
**Pumping lemma for context-free languages**.
* *Statement*. Consider a context-free language $A$, then there exists a number $p$, i.e. the pumping length, where if $s\in A$ and $|s|\geq p$, then $s=uvxyz$ where
    * For each $i\geq 0$, $uv^ixy^iz\in A$
    * $|vy|>0$, and
    * $|vxy|\leq p$

>**NOTE**. The last condition is sometimes useful in proving that certain languages are not context free

* *Proof*. Consider a CFL $A$ and a CFG $G$ generating $A$, then we must show that any sufficiently long string $s\in A$ can be pumped and remain in $A$
    * Since $s\in A$, it is derivable from $G$ and hence has a parse tree, which must be very tall due to the length of $s$

        $\to$ The tree must contain some long path from the start variable at the root of the tree to one of the terminal symbols at a leaf
    * On this long path, some variable symbol $R$ must repeat, due to the pigeonhole principle

        $\to$ This repetition allows us to replace the subtree undert the second occurrence of $R$ with the subtree under the first occurrence of $R$
    * Hence, we may cut $s$ into $uvxyz$, and we may repeat $v$ and $y$ and obtain a string still in $A$
