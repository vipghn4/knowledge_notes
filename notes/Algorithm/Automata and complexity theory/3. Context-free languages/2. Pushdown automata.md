# Pushdown automata
**Pushdown automata**. Similar to NFA but with a stack providing additional memory beyond the finite amount available in control

$\to$ The stack allows pushdown automata to recognize some nonregular languages
* *Equivalence to CFGs in power*. Pushdown automata are equivalent in power to CFGs

    $\to$ This gives us two options for proving that a language is context free
    * *Consequence*. For a given language, we can give a CFG generating it, or a pushdown automaton recognizing it
        * *Explain*. Certain languages are more easily described in terms of generators, whereas others are more easily described with recognizers
* *Schematic of a finite automaton and a pushdown automaton*.
    * *Schematic of a finite automaton*. Consist of
        * A state controller, which represents the states and the transition function
        * A tape containing the input string
        * An arrow representing the input head from the state controller to the tape, pointing at the next input symbol to read
    * *Schematic of a pushdown automaton*. Similar to the schematic of a finite automaton, with a stack component

**PDA stack**.
* *Operations on stack*. a PDA can write symbols on the stack and read them back later
    * *Operations*. All access to the stack, for both reading and writing, may be done only at the top
        * *Writing (or pushing) a symbol*. Push down all the other symbols on the stack
        * *Reading (or popping) a symbol*. The symbol on top of the stack can be read and removed, and the remaining symbols move back up
* *Stack size*. A stack is valuable since it can hold an unlimited amount of information

**Deterministicity of PDAs**. A PDA can be nondeterministic, and nondeterministic PDAs are not equivalent in power with deterministic PDA
* *Explain*. NPDA recognize certain languages, which no DPDA can recognize

>**NOTE**. We will not prove this

>**NOTE**. We focus on NDFA since these automata are equivalent in power to CFGs

## Formal definition of a pushdown automaton
**Stack and transition function**. The stack is a device containing symbols drawn from some alphabet $\Gamma$, which may differ from the alphabet $\Sigma$ used for input
* *Assumptions*.
    * $\Sigma_\varepsilon=\Sigma\cup\{\varepsilon\}$
    * $\Gamma_\varepsilon=\Gamma\cup\{\varepsilon\}$
* *Domain of the transition function of a PDA*. $Q\times\Sigma_\varepsilon\times\Gamma_\varepsilon$
    * *Interpretation*. The current state, the next input symbol read, and top symbol of the stack determine the behavior of a PDA
    * *Possible behaviors of a PDA*. Move without reading a symbol from the input, or without reading a symbol from the stack
* *Range of the transition function of a PDA*. $Q\times \Gamma_\varepsilon$, or $\mathcal{P}(Q\times \Gamma_\varepsilon)$ in case of nondeterminism
* *Transition function*. $\delta:Q\times\Sigma_\varepsilon\times\Gamma_\varepsilon\to\mathcal{P}(Q\times\Gamma_\varepsilon)$

**Pushdown automaton**. A 6-tuple $(Q,\Sigma,\Gamma,\delta,q_0,F)$, where $Q,\Sigma,\Gamma,F$ are finite sets
* $Q$ is the set of states
* $\Sigma$ is the set of input alphabet
* $\Gamma$ is the stack alphabet
* $\delta:Q\times\Sigma_\varepsilon\times\Gamma_\varepsilon\to\mathcal{P}(Q\times\Gamma_\varepsilon)$ is the transition function
* $q_0\in Q$ is the start state
* $F\subseteq Q$ is the set of accept states

**Computation of a PDA**. 
* *Assumption*.
    * $M=(Q,\Sigma,\Gamma,\delta,q_0,F)$ is a PDA
    * $s_i$ is the sequence of stack concents of $M$ on the accepting branch of the computation
* *Acceptance of string*. $M$ accepts input $w$ if $w$ can be written as $w=w_1\dots w_m$, where $w_i\in\Sigma_\varepsilon$, and there exists $r_0,\dots,r_m\in Q$ and $s_0,\dots,s_m\in\Gamma^*$ so that
    * $r_0=q_0$ and $s_0=\varepsilon$, i.e. $M$ should start properly
    * For $i=0,\dots,m-1$, $(r_{i+1},b)\in\delta(r_i,w_{i+1},a)$ where $s_i=at$ and $s_{i+1}=bt$ for some $a,b\in\Gamma_\varepsilon$ and $t\in\Gamma^*$

        $\to$ $M$ moves properly according to the state, stack, and next input symbol
    * $r_m\in F$, i.e. an accept state occurs at the input end
* *Notation*. $a,b\to c$ denotes that when the machine is reading an $a$ from the input, it may replace $b$ on the top of the stack with a $c$

**Commonly-used procedures with PDA**.
* *Testing for empty stack*. A PDA can check for empty stack by initially placing a special symbol  $\$$ on the stack

    $\to$ If it sees $\$$ again, it knows that the stack is effectively empty
* *Testing for the ending of the input string*. We assume that PDAs can test for the end of the input
    * *Explain*. The accept state takes effect only when the machine is at the end of the input

## Equivalence with CFGs
**Brief**. CFGs and pushdown automata are equivalent in power, i.e. both can describe the class of CFLs

**Lemma**. If a language is context free, then some pushdown automaton recognizes it
* *Proof*. Easy to prove

**Lemma**. If a pushdown automaton recognizes some language, then it is context fere
* *Proof*. Easy to prove

**Theorem**. A language is context free if and only if some pushdown automaton recognizes it
* *Proof*. Follow directly from the previous two lemmas

**Corollary**. Every regular language is context free
* *Explain*. Regular language is recognized by a finite automaton, and every finite automaton is a PDA without its stack
