# Automata, computability, and complexity
**Central areas of computation theory**. Automata, computability, and complexity
* *Central question*. What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers

## Complexity theory
**Complexity theory**. Computer problems come in different varieties, some are easy, some are hard
* *Central question*. What makes some problems computationally hard and otyhers easy?
* *Important achievements of complexity theory*. An elegant scheme for classifying problems according to their computational difficulty

    $\to$ Using this scheme, we can demonstrate a method for giving evidence that certain problems are computationally hard, even if we are unable to prove that they are

**Solving hard problems**.
* *Option 1*. By understanding which aspect of the problem is at the roof of the difficulty

    $\to$ We can alter it to make the problem easily solvable
* *Option 2*. Settle for less than a perfect solution to the problem
    * *Idea*. In certain cases, finding solutions, which only approximate the perfect one, is relatively easy
* *Option 3*. Some problems are hard only in the worst case situation, but easy most of the time

    $\to$ Depending on the application, we may be satisfied with a procedure, which occasionally is slow but usually runs quickly
* *Option 4*. Consider alternative types of computation, e.g. randomized computation, which can speed up certain tasks

**Applied area affected directly by complexity theory**. The ancient field of cryptography
* *Explain*.
    * In most fields, an easy computational problem is preferrable to a hard one, since easy ones are cheaper to solve
    * Cryptography is unsual since it specifically requires computational problems, which are hard
        * *Explain*. Secret codes should be hard to break without the secret key or password
* *Consequence*. Complexity theory has pointed cryptographers in the direction of computationally hard problems, around which they have designed revolutionary new codes

## Computability theory
**Computability theory**. Kurt Godel, Alan Turing, and Alonzo Church discovered that certain basic problems cannot be solved by computers
* *Example*. Determine whether a mathematical statement is true or false
* *Consequence*. Ideas concerning theoretical models of computers, which eventually would help lead to the construction of actual computers, are developed

**Computability and complexity**. Closely related, i.e.
* *Complexity theory*. The objective is to classify problems as easy and hard
* *Computability theory*. The objective is to classify problems as solvable and unsolvable

    $\to$ Computability theory introduces several of the concepts used in complexity theory

## Automata theory
**Automata theory**. Deal with the definitions and properties of mathematical models of computation

$\to$ These models play a role in several applied areas of computer science
* *Finite automaton*. A model used in text processing, compilers, and hardware design
* *Context-free grammar*. A model used in programming languages and AI

**Automata theory and computation theory**. Automata theory is a great place to begin the study of the theory of computation
* *Explain*. Computability and complexity theories require a precise definition of a computer

    $\to$ Automata theory allows practice with formal definitions of computation, since it introduces concepts relevant to other nontheoretical areas of computer science
