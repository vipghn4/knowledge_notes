# Mathematical notions and terminology
## Sets
**Set**. A group of objects represented as a unit
* *Elements (or members)*. Sets may contain any type of object, i.e. elements, including numbers, symbols, or even other sets
* *Formal descriptions of sets*. List a set's elements inside braces, e.g. $\{7, 21, 57\}$
    * *Order and repetitions of set elements*. The order of describing a set does not matter, nor does repetition of its members
* *Visual descriptions of sets*. Venn diagram
* *Operations on sets*. Union, intersection, and complement

**Relationship between sets and elements**.
* *Membership symbols*. $\in$ and $\notin$
* *Subset*. $A \subseteq B$ if $x\in A\implies x\in B$
* *Proper subset*. $A\subset B$ if $A\subseteq B$ and

    $$\exists x\in B, x\notin A$$

**Types of sets**.
* *Multiset*. A set with number of occurrences of members taken into account
* *Infinite set*. A set with infinitely many elements, e.g.
    * *Set of natural numbers*. $\mathcal{N}=\{1,2,3,\dots\}$
    * *Set of integers*. $\mathcal{Z}=\{\dots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\dots\}$
* *Empty set $\emptyset$*. A set with zero members

## Sequences and tuples
**Sequences**. A list of objects in some order
* *Formal description of sequences*. List the elements within parentheses, e.g. $(7, 21, 57)$
    * *Order and repetitions of set elements*. The order of describing a set does matter, so does repetition of its members
* *Tuples*. Finite sequences, i.e. a sequence with $k$ elements is a $k$-tuple
    * *Pair*. A 2-tuple

**Types of sets**.
* *Power set of a set $A$*. The set of all subsets of $A$, including the empty set

**Operations on sets**. Cartesian product (or cross product)

## Functions and relations
**Function (or mapping)**. An object setting up an input-output relationship, i.e. it takes an input and produces an output

$\to$ This is central to mathematics

>**NOTE**. In every function, the same input always produces the same output

* *Domain and range*. $f:D\to R$ denotes a function with
    * *Domain $D$*. The set of possible inputs to the function
    * *Range $R$*. The outputs of a function come from a set
* *Function arguments*. When a domain of $f$ is $A_1 \times\dots\times A_k$ for some sets $A_1,\dots,A_k$

    $\to$ The input to $f$ is a $k$-tuple $(a_1,\dots,a_k)$
    * *Arguments to $f$*. $a_1,\dots,a_k$
    * *Unary function*. $f$ with $k=1$
    * *Binary function*. $f$ with $k=2$
* *Infix and prefix notation of functions*.
    * *Infix notation*. The symbol for the function placed between its two arguments
        
        $\to$ Certain binary functions are written in this notation
    * *Prefix notation*. The symbol for the function precedes its arguments
* *Types of functions*.
    * *Onto function*. A function using all elements of the range

**Function description**.
* *Option 1*. Use a procedure for computing an output from a specified input
* *Option 2*. Use a table listing all possible inputs and gives the corresponding outputs

**Relation**.
* *Predicate (or property)*. A function whose range if $\{\text{TRUE}, \text{FALSE}\}$
* *Relation (or $k$-ary relation, or $k$-ary relation on $A$)*. A property, whose domain is a set of $k$ tuples $A\times \dots\times A$
    
    $\to$ A common case is 2-ary relation, i.e. binary relation
* *Equivalence relation*. Capture the notion of two objects being equal in some feature
    * *Formal*. A binary relation $R$ is an equivalence relation if $R$ satisfies three conditions
        * $R$ is reflexive, i.e. for every $x$, $xRx$ is true
        * $R$ is symmetric, i.e. for every $x$ and $y$, $xRy \implies yRx$
        * $R$ is transitive, i.e. for every $x,y,z$, $xRy\land yRz\implies xRz$

## Strings and languages
**Strings**. Strings of characters are fundamental building blocks in computer science
* *Alphabet*. Any nonempty finite set, upon which strings are defined
    * *Alphabet symbols*. The members of the alphabet
    * *Notation*. $\Sigma$ or $\Gamma$ are usually used to denote alphabets and a typewriter font for symbols from an alphabet
* *String over an alphabet*. A finite sequence of symbols from the alphabet, usually written next to one another, and not separated by commas
    * *String length of a string $w$*. $|w|$, i.e. the number of symbols contained in $w$
        * *Empty string $\varepsilon$*. A string with zero length, and play the role of $0$ in a number system
    * *Representation*. A string $w$ of length $n$ can be written as

        $$w=w_1 w_2 \dots w_n$$

        where each $w_i\in\Sigma$
    
    * *Reverse of a string $w$*. $w^\mathcal{R}$, i.e. obtained by writing $w$ in the opposite order
    * *Substring*. $z$ is a substring of $w$ if $z$ appears consecutively within $w$
* *Concatenation of two strings $x$ and $y$*. $xy$, i.e. obtained by appending $y$ to the end of $x$, i.e.

    $$x_1\dots x_m y_1\dots y_n$$

    * *Multiple concatenation*. To concatenate a string with itself many times, we use superscript notation, i.e. $x^k$

**Lexicographic ordering of strings**. The same as dictionary ordering, except that shorter strings precede longer strings

**Language**. A set of strings

## Boolean logic
**Boolean logic**. A mathematical system built around two values $\text{TRUE}$ and $\text{FALSE}$, i.e. Boolean values
* *Boolean operations*. Negation, conjunction (AND), and disjunction (OR), exclusive OR (XOR), equality, and implication

**Distributive law for AND and OR**. Come in two forms
* $P\land (Q\lor R) = (P\land Q)\lor (P\land R)$, and its dual
* $P\lor (Q\land R) = (P\lor Q)\land (P\lor R)$
