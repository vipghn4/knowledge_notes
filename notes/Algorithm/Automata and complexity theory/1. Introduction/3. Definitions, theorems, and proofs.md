## Definitions, theorems, and proofs
**Brief**. Theorems and proofs are the heart and soul of mathematics, and definitions are its spirit

**Definitions**. Describe the objects and notions to use
* *Precision of definitions*. Essential to any mathematical definition, i.e when defining some object

    $\to$ We must make clear what constitutes that object, and what does not

**Mathematical statements**. After defining objects and notions, we make mathematical statements about them
* *Mathematical statements*. Typically express that some object has a certain property
* *Precision of statements*. The statement may or may not be true, however, it must be precise

    $\to$ There must not be any ambiguity about its meaning

**Proof**. A convincing logical argument that a statement is true
* *Airtight proofs*. Mathematical proofs must be airtight, i.e. convincing in an absolute sense
  
    $\to$ In everyday life, or in the law, the standard of proof is lower

**Theorem**. A mathematical statement proved true
* *Lemmas*. Proven statements assisting in the proof of another statement
* *Corollaries*. Another related proven statement concluded from a theorm and its proof

## Finding proofs
**General strategies**.
1. Carefully read the statement we want to prove
2. Understand the notation, rewrite the statement in our own words
3. Break the statement down and consider each part separately
4. Try to get an intuitive, gut feeling of why it shoulud be true
5. Experimenting with examples is especially helpful
6. After experimenting, try to find a counterexample, i.e. an object failing to have the property

    $\to$ Seeing where we run into difficulty when we attempt to find a counterexample can help understanding why the statement is true
7. When the proof is believed to be found, write it up properly
    * *Well-written proof*. A sequence of statements, wherein each one follows by simple reasoning from previous statements in the sequence
    
    >**NOTE**. Carefully writing a proof is important to enable readers to understand it, and for us to be sure that it is free from errors

**Tips for producing a proof**.
* *Be patient*. Finding proofs takes time, i.e. researchers sometimes work for weeks or years to find a single proof
* *Come back to it*. Look over the statement we want to prove, think about it a bit, leave it, then return a few minutes or hours later

    $\to$ Let the unconscious, intuitive part of our mind have a chance to work
* *Be neat*. When building our intuition for the statement of interest, use simple, clear pictures, and/or text
    * *Explain*. 
        * We are trying to develop an insight into the statement, and sloppiness gets in the way of insight
        * When writing a solution for another person to read, neatness will help that person understand it
* *Be concise*. Brevity helps expressing high-level ideas without getting lost in details
    
    $\to$ Good mathematical notation is useful for expressing ideas concisely

    >**NOTE**. Make sure to include enough of our reasoning when writing up a proof for the reader to easily understand it
