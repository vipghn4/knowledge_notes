# Introduction
**Blockchan framework**. A collection of tools and libraries for building a runnable, secure, feature-complete blockchain

$\to$ A blockchain framework takes care of
* Consensus
* P2P networking
* Account management
* Basic blockchain logic, e.g. blocks, transactions etc.
* A client to interact with the blockchain

**Substrate**. A blockchain framework for building customized blockchains

$\to$ These blockchains can be run entirely autonomously, i.e. they do not depend on any external technology to run

**Polkadot**. A decentralized, protocol-based blockchain platform for enabling secure cross-blockchain communication
* *Explain*. Polkadot can be used as a kind of bridge between blockchains, i.e.
    * Polkadot takes care of the communication layer between chains
    * Polkadot makes it possible to interact between different blockchains, even systems such as Ethereum and Bitcoin
* *Conclusion*. This represents significant progress toward making the vision of Web3 a reality
    * *Vision of Web3*. A decentralized, blockchain-based version of the internet

## High-level overview of Substrate
**Node**. The basic unit when dealing with a decentralized peer-to-peer system

$\to$ This is where our blockchain runs
* *Description*. A node is run inside a client and provides all the basic components the system needs to function, e.g. 
    * P2P networking
    * Storage of the blockchain
    * The logic for block processing and consensus
    * The ability to interact with the blockchain from the outside

**Levels of details for a Substrate project**. When starting a Substrate project, we have three options to
* Substrate Node
* Substrate FRAME
* Substrate Core

### Substrate Node
**Substrate Node**. Use the pre-designed Substrate Node, i.e. the highest level we can start at

$\to$ Substrate Node provides the most prebuilt functionality and the least technical freedom
* *Key features*.
    * Substrate Node is fully runnable and includes default implementations for all basic components, e.g.
        * Account management
        * Privileged access
        * Consensus, etc. 
    * We can customize the genesis block, i.e., initial state, of the chain to start out
* *Using Substrate Node*. Only a JSON file is needed to launch our blockchain
    * *Explain*. The JSON file allows we to configure the genesis state of the modules composing the Substrate Node's runtime, e.g. 
        * Balances
        * Staking
        * Sudo
* *Consequence*. Once we are ready to really build our own blockchain
    
    $\to$ We should use use Substrate FRAME

### Subtrate FRAME
**Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities (FRAME)**. A framework for building a Substrate runtime from existing libraries and with a high degree of freedom to determine our blockchain’s logic
* *Using Substrate FRAME*. Start from Substrate’s prebuilt node template and can add pallets to customize and extend our chain
    * *Pallets*. Substrate’s name for library modules
* *Key features*. At this level of abstraction, we can fully customize our blockchain’s logic, state and data types
* *Conclusion*. This level leverages the best of both ease of development and technical freedom
    * *Explain*. We have to invest minimal time in setting up our blockchain and can focus fully on our own customizations

>**NOTE**. The Substrate Developer Hub node template is a helpful starting point for such projects

### Substrate Core
**Substrate Core**. The entire FRAME system can be ignored, and the runtime can be designed and implemented from scratch

$\to$ we can use this runtime and run it within the Substrate node

>**NOTE**. This could be done in any language that can target WebAssembly

* *Technical difficulties*.
    * If the runtime can be made to be compatible with the abstract block authoring logic of the Substrate node
        
        $\to$ We can simply construct a new genesis block from our Wasm blob and launch our chain with the existing Rust-based Substrate client
    * Otherwise, we will need to alter the client's block authoring logic, and potentially even alter the header and block serialization formats
        
        $\to$ In terms of development effort, this is the most difficult way to use Substrate
* *Conclusion*. 
    * This approach certainly requires the most work and the highest level of difficulty
    * This approach comes with the highest degree of technical freedom while still being able to work seamlessly within the Substrate ecosystem

## Substrate core concepts
**Substrate node structure**

</div>

* *Runtime*. Each Substrate node contains a runtime, which contains the business logic of the chain
    * *Explain*.
        * The runtime defines what transactions are valid and invalid
        * The runtime determines how the chain's state changes in response to transactions
* *Outer part*. Everything other than the runtime
    
    >**NOTE**. This part does not compile to Wasm, only to native
    
    * *Explain*. The outer node is responsible for
        * Handling peer discovery
        * Transaction pooling
        * Block and transaction gossiping
        * Consensus
        * Answering RPC calls from the outside world
        * Query the runtime for information
        * Provide information to the runtime
* *Runtime API*. Facilitate the communication between the outer node and the runtime

### Runtime
**Blockchain runtime**. The business logic defining the blockchain's behavior
* *State transition function*. The runtime in Substrate-based chains
    * *Explain*. It is where Substrate developers define
        * The storage items used to represent the blockchain's state
        * The functions allowing blockchain users to make changes to this state
* *Conclusion*. The runtime of the Substrate-based application is the heart and soul of the project
    * *Consequence*. The runtime is central, where we will spend a majority of time when implementing our custom Substrate blockchain

**Customized runtimes**. Substrate itself adheres to the principle of trying to be as open as possible when it comes to custom runtimes
* *Support for customized runtimes*. There are some interfaces with which any runtime has to be compatible
    
    $\to$ Beyond that, we have full technical and creative freedom to implement the blockchain
* *FRAME*. Used to compose existing modules, i.e. pallets
    
    >**NOTE**. There are 50+ pallets shipped with Substrate and the ones provided by third-party developers to build our runtime

**Examples**. Some examples for functionality regarding runtime include
* Building a new block
* Integrating data from outside the chain
* Handling accounts down to actual cryptographic primitives to use

### Consensus and accounts
**Brief**. Because blockchain systems are peer-to-peer with multiple nodes without any hierarchy between them

$\to$ There is the inherent problem of agreeing on the correct state

**Consensus problem**. If multiple participants in the network attempt to make changes to the state

$\to$ The validity and order of these transactions might be different depending on when each node was notified of the changes
* *Consequence*. Conflicts between different parts of the network, which need to be resolved quickly and safely, for smooth functioning

**Consensus engines**. Used by blockchain systems to handle consensus problem
* *Brief*. These engines implement rules defining 
    * How state-transition needs to happen, i.e. guaranteeing that it’s deterministic
    * How to resolve conflicts
* *Effects on the functioning of a blockchain*. This touches on 
    * Block creation, finality, i.e. knowing when a transaction is completed, and
    * Fork choice/conflict resolution between competing states

* *Consensus options provided by Substrate*. 
    * Substrate provides a handful of consensus options already
    * It is also possible to roll out your own, depending on your exact needs, or to mix, match, and extend existing solutions

**Accounts**. The notion of a participant in the network
* *Account structure*. Consist of one or a set of public/private key pairs
* *Substrate's supports for accounts*. Substrate also provides, besides very basic account handling, the possibility for accounts with different use cases

**Stash key and controller key**. 
* *Stash key (or key pair)*. Define a stash account, where we might keep a large number of funds
    
    $\to$ The security of the key is very important and should be kept offline
    
    >**NOTE**. We should almost never directly interact with the chain using a stash account

* *Controller accounts*. Used when our use case requires frequent interaction with the chain
    
    $\to$ They can be designated by stash keys as proxies
    * *Characteristics*. These accounts are used for direct interaction and only need enough funds to cover transaction fees
        
        $\to$ The keys still need to be secured, but since they control fewer funds, the stakes are not that high

### Extrinsics and transactions
**Extrinsics and intrinsics**. In a blockchain, there are extrinsics and intrinsics
* *Extrinsics*. A piece of information from outside the chain, which is included in a block
* *Intrinsics*. Things happening inside the chain

**Extrinsics**. Necessary for interacting with the state of the blockchain from the outside
* *Block struture in a Substrate blockchain*. Contain 
    * A header, i.e. block height, parent hash, extrinsics root, state root, and digest
    * An array of extrinsics, i.e. information from outside the chain

# Appendix
## Concepts
**Fork**. 
* *Fork*. Happen whenever a community makes a change to the blockchain’s protocol, or basic set of rules

    $\to $When this happens, the chain splits
    * *Consequence*. A second blockchain is produced, which shares all of its history with the original but is headed off in a new direction
* *Purposes*. Make a cryptocurrency more secure or add other features
* *Types of fork*.
    * *Soft fork*. Similar to a software upgrade for the blockchain
        
        $\to$ As long as it is adopted by all users, it becomes a currency’s new set of standards
        * *Purposes*. Used to bring new features or functions, typically at the programming level
        * *Backward compatibility*. Since the end result is a single blockchain
            
            $\to$ The changes are backward-compatible with the pre-fork blocks. 
    * *Hard fork*. A hard fork happens when the code changes so much the new version is no longer backward-compatible with earlier blocks, i.e. 
        * The blockchain splits in two
            * The original blockchain
            * The new version following the new set of rules
        * This creates an entirely new cryptocurrency
            
            $\to$ This is the source of many well-known coins
* *Fork choice*. A function, evaluated by the client
    * *Inputs*. The set of blocks and other messages that have been produced
    * *Outputs*. What the “canonical chain” is
