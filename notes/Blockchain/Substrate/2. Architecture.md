# Architecture
**Substrate client**. An application running a Substrate-based blockchain node with the following components

* *Storage*. Used to persist the evolving state of a Substrate blockchain
    
    $\to$ The blockchain network allows participants to reach trustless consensus about the state of storage
    * *Supports from Substrate*. Substrate ships with a simple and highly efficient key-value storage mechanism
* *Runtime*. The logic defining how blocks are processed, including state transition logic
    * *Runtime code in Substrate*. Compiled to Wasm and become part of the blockchain's storage state
        
        $\to$ This enables forkless runtime upgrades
        
    * *Native runtime*. Substrate clients may also include a native runtime, which is compiled for the same platform as the client itself, as opposed to Wasm
    * *Executor*. The component of the client that dispatches calls to the runtime
        
        $\to$ Its main role is to select between the native code and interpreted Wasm
        
        >**NOTE**. Although the native runtime may offer a performance advantage
        >
        >$\to$ The executor will select to interpret the Wasm runtime if it implements a newer version

* *Peer-to-peer network*. The capabilities allowing the client to communicate with other network participants
    * *P2P network in Substrate*. Use the Rust implementation of the libp2p network stack
* *Consensus*. The logic allowing network participants to agree on the state of the blockchain
    * *Supports by Substrate*. 
        * Substrate allows supplying custom consensus engines
        * Substrate ships with several consensus mechanisms, which have been built on top of Web3 Foundation research
* *RPC (remote procedure call)*. The capabilities allowing blockchain users to interact with the network
    * *Supports by Substrate*. Substrate provides HTTP and WebSocket RPC servers
* *Telemetry*. Client metrics exposed by the embedded Prometheus server

## Concepts
**Forkless runtime upgrades**.
* *Traditional state transition function update*. Traditional blockchains require a hard fork when upgrading the state transition function of their chain
    
    $\to$ Node operators must stop their nodes and manually upgrade to the latest executable
    * *Consequence*. For distributed production networks, coordination of a hard fork upgrades can be a complex process
* *Forkless runtime upgrades*. The upgrade of the runtime logic can happen in real time without causing a fork in the network
* *Idea*. 
    1. Substrate uses existing runtime logic to update the Wasm runtime stored on the blockchain to a new consensus-breaking version with new logic
        
        $\to$ This upgrade gets pushed out to all syncing nodes on the network as a part of the consensus process
    2. Once the Wasm runtime is upgraded, the executor will see that the native runtime `spec_name`, `spec_version`, or `authoring_version` no longer matches this new Wasm runtime
    3. The executor executes the canonical Wasm runtime, instead of using the native runtime in any of the execution processes
* *Consequence*. In order to provide its defining forkless runtime upgrade capabilities
    
    $\to$ Substrate runtimes are built as WebAssembly (Wasm) bytecode
