# Quartz clocks
## Fundamental concepts
**Resonance**. The phenomenon of increased amplitude occuring when the frequency of a periodically applied force, or a Fourier component of it, is equal or close to a natural frequency of a system, on which it acts
* *Explain*. When an oscillating force is applied at a resonant frequency of a dynamic system

    $\to$ The system will oscillate at a higher amplitude than when the same force is applied at other, non-resonant frequencies

**Resonator**. A device or system that exhibits resonance or resonant behavior
* *Explain*. It naturally oscillates with greater amplitude at some frequencies, i.e. resonant frequencies, than at other frequencies
* *Usage* Generate waves of specific frequencies, or to select specific frequencies from a signal
* *Example*. Quartz crystals used in electronic devices, e.g. radio transmitter, and quartz watches to produce oscillation of very precise frequency

**Transducer**. A device converting energy from one form to another, e.g. a signal in one form of energy to a signal in another

## Piezoelectricity
### Introduction
**Piezoelectricity**. The process of using crystals to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, or vice versa

* *Crystal structure*. 
    * *Unit cell*. Regular crystals are defined by their organized and repeating structure of atoms that are held together by bonds, this is called a unit cell
    * *Symmetry of unit cell*. Most crystals, such as iron have a symmetrical unit cell, which makes them useless for piezoelectric purposes

        </div>
        
    * *Piezoelectric materials*. The structure in these crystals aren’t symmetrical but they still exist in an electrically neutral balance

        * *Consequence*. 
            * If we apply mechanical pressure to a piezoelectric crystal

                $\to$ The structure deforms, atoms get pushed around, and suddenly you have a crystal that can conduct an electrical current
            * If we take the same piezoelectric crystal and apply an electric current to it
                
                $\to$ The crystal will expand and contract, converting electrical energy into mechanical energy
* *Definition from Wikipedia*. The electric charge accumulating in certain solid materials, in response to applied mechanical stress
    * *Meaning of "piezoelectricity"*. Electricity resulting from pressure and latent heat

        $\to$ It is derived from the Greek word "piezein", i.e. squeeze or press, and "elektron", i.e. "amber"
    * *Origins of piezoelectric effect*. The linear electromechanical interaction between mechanical and electrical states in crystalline materials with no inversion symmetry

**Nature of piezoelectric effect and electric dipole moments in solids**. Closely related to the occurrence of electric dipole moments in solids
* *Electric dipole moments in solids*. 
    * Either be induced for ions on crystal lattice sites with asymmetric charge surroundings, or

        </div>

        * *Crystal lattice (Bravais lattice)*. An infinite array of discrete points generated by a set of discrete translation operations given as

            $$\mathbf{R}=n_1 + \mathbf{a}_1 + n_2 \mathbf{a}_2 + n_3 \mathbf{a}_3$$

            where $n_i$ are integers and $\mathbf{a}_i$ are primitive translation vectors
    * Directly be carried by molecular groups
* *Dipole density (polarization)*. Can be calculated for crystals by summing up the dipole moments per volume of the crystallographic unit cell
    * *Dipole field*. Since every dipole is a vector, the dipole density $\mathbf{P}$ is a vector field
    * *Dipole orientation*. Dipoles near each other tend to be aligned in regions called Weiss domains

        <div style="text-align:center">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NuyIWab.png">
            <figcaption>Weiss domains</figcaption>
        </div>

        * *Poling*. The domains are usually randomly oriented, but can be aligned using the process of poling, i.e. a strong electric field is applied across the material, usually at elevated temperatures

**Importance of piezoelectric effect**. The change of polarization $\mathbf{P}$ when applying a mechanical stress
* *Explain*. This may be caused 
    * By a reconfiguration of the dipole-inducing surrounding, or 
    * By re-orientation of molecular dipole moments under the influence of the external stress
* *Consequence*. Piezoelectricity may then manifest in a variation of the polarization strength, its direction or both, with the details depending on
    * The orientation of $\mathbf{P}$ within the crystal
    * Crystal symmetry
    * The applied mechanical stress
* *Generation of electricity*. The change in $\mathbf{P}$ appears as a variation of surface charge density upon the crystal faces, as a variation of electric field extending between the faces caused by a change in dipole density in the bulk

**Converse piezoelectric effect**. Piezoelectric materials also show the opposite effect, where the application of electrical field creates mechanical deformation in the crystal

**Direct piezoelectric effect**. Applying mechanical energy to a crystal

* A piezoelectric crystal is placed between two metal plates
    
    $\to$ At this point the material is in perfect balance and does not conduct an electric current
* Mechanical pressure is then applied to the material by the metal plates, which forces the electric charges within the crystal out of balance
    
    $\to$ Excess negative and positive charges appear on opposite sides of the crystal face.
* The metal plate collects these charges, which can be used to produce a voltage and send an electrical current through a circuit

**Inverse piezoelectric effect**. Applying an electrical signal to a material

<div style="text-align:center">

* In the same situation as the example above, we have a piezoelectric crystal placed between two metal plates
    
    $\to$ The crystal’s structure is in perfect balance.
* Electrical energy is then applied to the crystal, which shrinks and expands the crystal’s structure
* As the crystal’s structure expands and contracts, converting the received electrical energy and releases mechanical energy in the form of a sound wave

**Applications of piezoelectricity**. Actuators, speakers and buzzers, drivers, sensors, power, motors, etc.

## Introduction to quartz clock
**Quartz clock (quartz watches)**. Timepieces which use an electronic oscillator regulated by a quartz crystal to keep time

* *Advantage over mechanical clocks*. The crystal oscillator creates a signal with very precise frequency

    $\to$ Quartz clocks and watches are at least order of magnitude more accurate than mechanical clocks

**Properties of quartz**.
* *Piezoelectric material*. 
    * *Description*.
        * When a quartz crystal is subject to mechanical stress, e.g. bending

            $\to$ It accumulates electrical charge across some planes
        * If charges are placed across the crystal plane, quartz crystals will bend
    * *Consequence*. 
        * *Quartz crystal in resonator*. Since quartz can be directly driven to flex by an electric signal, no additional transducer is required to use it in a resonator
        * *Quartz crystal in phonograph catridges*. The movement of the stylus, i.e. needle, flexes a quartz crystal , producing a small voltage

            $\to$ This voltage is amplified and played through speakers
* *Change of size due to temperature*. Quartz crystal's size does not change much as temperature fluctuates
    * *Consequence*. A quartz plate's resonance frequency, based on its size, will not significantly rise or fall
        
        $\to$ Since its resonator does not change the shape, a quartz clock will remain relatively accurate as the temperature changes

**History of quartz resonator**.
* In the early 20th century, radio engineers sought a precise, stable source of radio frequencies and started with steel resonator
* When Walter Guyton Cady found that quartz can resonate with less equipment and better temperature stability

    $\to$ Steel resonators disappeared within a few years
* Later, scientists at NIST discovered that a crystal oscillator could be more accurate than a pendulum clock

## Quartz clock sturcture and mechanism
**Quartz clock structure**. A feedback oscillator circuit in the form of a crystal oscillator circuit

    <figcaption>A feedback linear oscillator; an amplifier A with its output v_0 fed back to its input v_f through a filter beta(j \omega)</figcaption>
</div>

* *Filter*. A piezoelectric crystal, e.g. a quartz crystal
    * *Idea*. The crystal mechanically vibrates as a resonator, and its frequency of vibration determines the oscillation frequency
    * *Benefits of crystal resonator*. Very high Q-factor and better temperature stability

        $\to$ These lead to better frequency stability
* *Q-factor*. 
    * *Definitions*.
        * *Bandwidth definition*. $Q=\frac{f_r}{\Delta f}$ where $f_r$ is the resonant frequency, and $\Delta f$ is the resonant width
        * *Stored energy definition*. $Q=2\pi \times \frac{\text{energy\_stored}}{energy\_dissipated\_per\_cycle}$
    * *Resonant width*. The bandwidth, over which the power of vibration is greater than half the power at the resonant frequency
    * *Interpretation*. Higher Q-factor implies less power loss after each cycle of oscillation, i.e.
        * *Option 1*. How underdamped an oscillator or resonator is
            * *Underdamped*. An oscillating mass commonly tends to overshoot its starting position, then return, overshooting again

                $\to$ With each overshoot, some energy in the system is dissipated, and the oscillation die towards zero
        * *Option 2*. Approximately the ratio of the initial energy stored in the resonator to the energy lost in one radian of the oscillation cycle

**Quartz resonator**.

    <figcaption>Quartz crystal resonator used as the time keeping component in quartz watches and clocks, with the case removed. It is formed in the shape of a tuning fork</figcaption>
</div>

* *Mechanisms*.
    1. The electronic circuit acts as an oscillator, i.e. an amplifier whose output passes through the quartz resonator
    2. The resonator acts as an electronic filter, eliminating but the single frequency of interest
    3. The output of this module feeds back to the input of the amplifier
        
        $\to$ The resonator assures that the oscillator howls with the exact frequency of interest
    4. When the circuit is powered up, a single burst of shot noice, which always present in electronic circuits, can cascade to bringing the oscillator into oscillation at the desired frequency

        >**NOTE**. If the amplifier were perfectly noise-free, the oscillator would not start

        * *Burst noise*. Burst noise plagues semiconductors, and is usually caused by the imperfection of the semiconductor materials
            * *Interpretation*. Burst noise represents abrupt voltage or current transations, which can even be heard by amplifying a contaminated signal
            * *Example*. When transferred to a speaker, this signal sounds like popcorn popping

                $\to$ This type of noise is sometimes referred as "popcorn noise"
* *Oscillation frequency of the crystal*. Depend on its shape, size, and the crystal plane, on which the quartz is cut
    * *Typical shape*. The crystal is cut in a small tuning fork shape on a particular crystal plane
    * *Typical resulting frequency*. In nearly all quartz watches, the frequency is $32768=2^{15}$
        * *Desired properties*.
            * The frequency is high enough to exceed the human hearing range
            * The frequency is low enough to keep electric energy consumption at a modest level, and to permit inexpensive counters to derive a 1-second pulse

        >**NOTE**. It is possible for quartz clocks and watches to have their quartz crystal oscillate at a higher frequency than 32768 Hz, or generate a digital pulse more than once per second
        >* *Purpose*. Drive an analog second hand at a higher power of 2 than once every second
        >* *Trade-off*. The energy consumption goes up accordingly, since higher oscillation frequencies and any activation of stepping motore costs energy

**One-second counter implementation**. 
1. The data line output from such a quartz resonator goes high and low 32768 times a second
2. The data line output is fed into a flipflop, which changes from low to high, or vice versa, whenever the line from the crystal goes from high to low
    * *Flip-flop*. Essentially two transistors with a bit of cross-connection
3. The output of the first flip-flop is fed into a second flip-flop, and so on
4. Through a chain of 15 flip-flops, each of which acts as an effective power of 2 frequency divider

    $\to$ The result is a 15-bit binary digital counter driven by the frequency, which will overlow once per second
    * *Frequency divider*. Divide the frequency of the input signal by 2
    * *Consequence*. A digital pulse is created once per second
