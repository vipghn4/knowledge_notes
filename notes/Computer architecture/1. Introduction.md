# Introduction
## Organization and architecture
**Computer architecture**. Attributes of a system visible to a programmer, or attributes having direct impact on the logical execution of a program
* *Example*. Instruction set, the number of bits used to represent various data types, I/O mechanisms, and techniques for addressing memory

**Computer organization**. The operational units and their interconnections realizing the architectural specifications
* *Example*. Hardware details transparent to the programmer, e.g. control signals, interfaces between the computer and peripherals, and the memory technology used

**Distinction between architecture and organization**.
* Many computer manufacturers offer a family of computer models, all with the same architecture but differences in organization

    $\to$ Different models in the family have different price and performance statistics
* A particular architecture may span many yeasr and encompass a number of different computer models, while its organization changing with changing technology

**Architecture and organization of microcomputers**. The relationship between architecture and organization is very close
* *Explain*. Changes in technology not only influence organization but also result in the introduction of more powerful and more complex architectures

    $\to$ There is less of a requirement for generation-to-generation compatibility for smaller machines

## Structure and function
**Hierachical system**. A set of interrelated subsystems, each of which hierarchical in structure until we reach some lowest level of elementary subsystem

>**NOTE**. The hierarchical nature of complex systems is essential to both their design and their description

* *Benefits*.
    * The designer need only deal with a particular level of the system at a time
    * At each level, the system consists of a set of components and their interrelationships

        $\to$ The behavior at each level depends only on a simplified, abstracted characterization of the system at the next lower level

**Structure and function**.
* *Structure*. The way in which the components are interrelated
* *Function*. The operation of each individual component as part of the structure

**Building system description**. Use top-down or bottom-up approaches

>**NOTE**. Evidence from a number of fields suggests that the top-down approach is the clearest and most effective

### Function
**General functions**. Data processing, data storage, data movement, and control

**Data processing**. There are only a few fundamental methods or types of data processing, despite of variety forms and requirement range of data processing

**Data storage**. There is at least a short-term data storage function, and a long-term data storage function

**Data movement**. The computer's operating environment consists of devices serving as sources or destinations of data
* *Input/output process*. When data are received from or delivered to a device directly connected to the computer
    * *Peripheral*. A device directly connected to the computer
* *Data communication*. When data is moved over longer distances, to or from a remote device

**Data control**. Control the computer's resources and orchastrates the performance of its functional parts in response to those instructions

**Interaction between the computer and external environment**. All of the computer's linkages to the external environment can be classified as
* Peripheral devices
* Communication lines

**Internal structure of the computer**. Consist of four main structural components
* *Central processing unit (CPU)*. Also called *processor*. Control the operation of the computer, and performs its data processing functions
* *Main memory*. Store data
* *I/O*. Move data between the computer and its external environment
* *System interconnection*. Provide for communication among CPU, main memory, and I/O
    * *Example*. System bus, i.e. a number of conducting wires, to which all the other components attach

**CPU structural components**.
* *Control unit (CU)*. Control the operation of the CPU and hence the computer
* *Arithmetic and logic unit (ALU)*. Perform the computer's data processing functions
* *Registers*. Provide storage internal to the CPU
* *CPU interconnection*. Provide for communication among CU, ALU, and registers

**Microprogrammed implementation**. An approach to implement the control unit
* *Idea*. CU operates by executing micro-instructions defining the functionality of the control uni
