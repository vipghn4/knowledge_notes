# Internal memory
**Semiconductor main memory subsystems**. Include ROM, DRAM, and SRAM memories

## Semiconductor main memory
**Most common form of random-access storage for computer main memory**. Emply an array of doughnut-shaped ferromagnetic loops, referred to as *cores*

$\to$ Main memory was often referred to as *core*, a tern which persists to this day

### Organization
**Memory cell**. The basic element of a semiconductor memory
* *Common properties of memory cell across semiconductor memory technologies*.

        <figcaption>Memory cell operation</figcaption>
    </div>

    * Memory cells exhibit two stable, or semistable, states representing binary 0 and 1
    * Memory cells are capable of being written into (at least once), to set the state
    * Memory cells are capable of being read to sense the state
* *Functional terminals of a memory cell*. Capable of carrying an electrical signal
    * *Select terminal*. Select a memory cell for a read or write operation
    * *Control terminal*. Indicate read or write
    * *Writing*. The other terminal provides an electrical signal which sets the state of the cell to 1 or 0
    * *Reading*. The terminal (in writing) is used for output of the cell's state
* *Consequence*. Individual cells can be selected for reading and writing operations

### DRAM and SRAM
>**NOTE**. All of the memory types we explore in this chapter are random access, i.e. individual words of memory are directly accessed through wired-in addressing logic

**Types of semiconductor memory**.

    <figcaption>Semiconductor memory types</figcaption>
</div>

* *Most common type*. Random-access memory (RAM)
    * *Characteristics*.
        * It is possible both to read data from the memory and to write new data into the memory easily and rapidly
            * *Read and write implementation*. Use electrical signals
        * It is volatile, i.e. it must be provided with a constant power supply

            $\to$ If the power is interrupted, then the data are lost
            * *Consequence*. RAM can be used only as temporary storage
    * *Types of RAM*. DRAM and SRAM

    <figcaption>Typical memory cell structures</figcaption>
</div>

**Dynamic RAM (DRAM)**. Made with cells which store data as charge on capacitors, i.e. the presence or absence of charge in a capacitor is interpreted as a binary 1 or 0
* *Periodic charge*. Since capacitors have a natural tendency to dischange

    $\to$ DRAMs require periodic charge refreshing to maintain data storage
    * *"Dynamic" term*. Refer to the tendency of the stored charge to leak away, even with power continuously applied
* *Typical DRAM structure for an individual cell storing 1 bit*.
    * *Address line*. Activated when the bit value from this cell is to be read or written
    * *Transistor*. Act as a switch, which is
        * Closed, i.e. allowing current to flow, if a voltage is applied to the address line
        * Open, i.e. no current flows, if no voltage is present on the address line
* *Operations*.
    * *Writing procedure*.
        1. A voltage signal is applied to the bit line, with high voltage representing 1 and low voltage representing 0
        2. A signal is then applied to the address line, allowing a charge to be transferred to the capacitor
    * *Reading procedure*.
        1. When the address line is selected, the transistor turns on

            $\to$ The charge stored on the capacitor is fed out onto a bit line, and to a sense amplifier
        2. The sense amplifier compares the capacitor voltage to a reference value and determines if the cell contains a logic 1 or a logic 0
        3. The readout from the cell discharges the capacitor, i.e. the charge is gone

            $\to$ Data must be rewritten to the cell at the end of the read
* *Bit value determination*. The DRAM cell is essentially an analog device, thus the capacitor can store any charge value within a range

    $\to$ A threshold value determines whether the charge is interpreted as 1 or 0

**Static RAM (SRAM)**. A digital device using the same logic elements used in the processor
* *Idea*. Binary values are stored using traditional flip-flop logic-gate configurations

    >**NOTE**. A static RAM will hold its data as long as power is supplied to it

* *Typical SRAM structure for an individual cell*.
    * *Transistors*. Four transistors, i.e. $T_1,T_2,T_3,T_4$, are cross connected in an arrangement producing a stable logic state
        * *Logic state 1*. Point $C_1$ is high and $C_2$ is low
            * *Transistor state*. $T_1,T_4$ are off, and $T_2,T_3$ are on
        * *Logic state 0*. Point $C_1$ is low and $C_2$ is high
            * *Transistor state*. $T_1,T_4$ are on, and $T_2,T_3$ are off
        * *Stability of states*. Both states are stable, as long as the direct current (DC) voltage is applied

            $\to$ No refresh is required to retain data
    * *Address line*. Used to open or close a switch
        * *Idea*. The address line controls two transistors $T_5,T_6$

            $\to$ When a signal is applied to this line, two transistors are switched on, allowing a read or write operation
* *Operations*.
    * *Writing procedure*. The desired bit value is applied to line $B$, while its complement is applied to $\bar{B}$

        $\to$ This forces $T_1,T_2,T_3,T_4$ into the proper state
    * *Reading procedure*. The bit value is read from line $B$

**SRAM and DRAM**.
* *Volatility*. Both static and dynamic RAMs are volatile, i.e. power must be continuously supplied to the memory to preserve the bit values
* *Cell size*. DRAM cell is simpler and smaller than SRAM cell, thus a DRAM is more dense and less expensive than a corresponding SRAM
* *Power supply*. DRAM requires the supporting refresh circuity
* *Speed*. SRAMs are faster than DRAMs
* *Usage*.
    * DRAMs tend to be favored for large memory requirements, thus tend to be used for main memory
        * *Explain*. For larger memories, the fixed cost of the refresh circuitry is more than compensated for by the smaller variable cost of DRAM cells
    * SRAMs is used for cache memory, both on- and off-chip

### Types of ROM
**Read-only memory (ROM)**. Contain a permanent pattern of data which cannot be changed
* *Volatility*. A ROM is nonvolatile, i.e. no power source is required to maintain the bit values in memory
* *Usage*. 
    * Microprogramming, i.e. write microcode, i.e. low-level code defining how a microprocessor should function when it executes machine-language instructions, for a microprocessor
        * *Example*. IBM used capacitor read-only storage (CROS) and transformer read-only storage (TROS) to store microcode for the smaller System/360 models, the 360/85, and the initial two System/370 models
    * Library subroutines for frequently wanted functions
    * System programs
    * Function tables, i.e. a table describing a function by displaying inputs and corresponding outputs in tabular form
* *Advantages*. The data or program is permanently in main memory, and need never be loaded from a secondary storage device

**ROM fabrication process**. A ROM is created like any other integrated circuit chip, with the data actually wired into the chip as part of the fabrication process
* *Problems*.
    * The data insertion step includes a relatively large fixed cost, whether one or thousands of copies of a particular ROM are fabricated
    * There is no room for error, i.e. if one bit is wrong, the whole batch of ROMs must be thrown out

**Programmable ROM (PROM)**. When only a small number of ROMs with a particular memory content is required

$\to$ PROM is a less expensive alternative
* *Idea*. Allow users to program ROM contents exactly once by physically altering its structure with the application of high-voltage pulses

    $\to$ The writing process is performed electrically and may be performed by a supplier or customer at a time later than the original chip fabrication

    >**NOTE**. Special equipment is required for the wiring or programming process

* *Nonvolatility*. PROM is nonvolatile and may be written into only once
* *Pros*. A company can simply order a large batch of fresh PROM chips and program them with the desired contents as its designers' convenience

    $\to$ PROMs provide flexibility and convenience

**Read-mostly memory**. Useful for applications, in which read operations are far more frequent than write operations, but for which nonvolatile storage is required
* *Erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM)*. 
    * *Idea*.
        * Read and write are done electrically, as with PROM
        * Before a write operation, all the storage cells must be erased to the same initial state by exposure of the packged chip to ultraviolet radiation
    * *Erasure*. Performed by shining an intense ultraviolet light through a window, which is designed into the memory chip
        * *Repeat*. This erasure process can be performed repeatedly, with each erasure taking as much as 20 minutes to perform
    * *Pros*. EPROM can be altered multiple times, and hold its data virtually indefinitely
    * *Cons*. For comparable amounts of storage, EPROM is more expensive than PROM
* *Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM)*. A read-mostly memory which can be written into at any time without erasing prior contents, i.e. only the bytes addressed are updated
    * *Write operation*. Take considerably longer than the read operation, on the order of several hundred microseconds per byte
    * *Pros*. Combine the advantage of nonvolatility with the flexibility of being updatable in place, using ordinary bus control, address, and data lines
    * *Cons*. More expensive than EPROM, and also is less dense, thus support fewer bits per chip
* *Flash memory*. The term "flash" is due to the speed with which the memory can be reprogrammed
    * *Erasure*. Flash memory uses an electrical erasing technology, like EEPROM

        $\to$ An entire flash memory can be erased in one or a few seconds, which is much faster than EPROM

        >**NOTE**. It is possible to erase just blocks of memory, rather than an entire chip

    * *"Flash"*. The microchip is organized so that a section of memory cells are erased in a single action, or "flash"
    * *Pros*. 
        * Intermediate between EPROM and EEPROM in both cost and functionality
        * Use only one transistor per bit, thus achieve the high density of ERPOM, compared with EEPROM
    * *Cons*. Does not provide byte-level erasure

### Chip logic
**Semiconductor memory chip**. Semiconductor memory comes in packaged chips, each of which contains an array of memory cells
* *Trade-off between levels of the memory hierarchy*. Exist when we consider the organization of memory cells and functional logic on a chip
* *Key design issues*. The number of bits of data which may be read or written at a time
    * *Extreme case 1*. An organization, in which the physical arrangement of cells in the array is the same as the logical arrangement, as percevied by the processor, of words of memory

        $\to$ The array is organized into $W$ words of $B$ bits each
    * *Extreme case 2*. Data are read or written 1 bit at a time

**Typical organization of a 16Mbit DRAM**.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/WbhznKS.png">
    <figcaption>Typical 16Mb DRAM (4Mb x 4)</figcaption>
</div>

* *Read and write size*.  4 bits are read or written at a time

    $\to$ There must be multiple DRAM connected to the memory controller to read or write a word of data to the bus
* *Logical structure*. The memory array is organized as four square arrays of $2048\times 2048$ elements
* *Physical structure*. Various physical arrangements are possible
    * *Array element connection*. In any case, the elements of the array are connected by both horizontal (row) and vertical (column) lines
        * Each horizontal line connects to the Select terminal of each cell in its row
        * Each vertical line connects to the Data-In/Sense terminal of each cell in its column
* *Address lines*. Supply the address of the word to be selected
    * *Number of address lines*. $\log_2 W$,
    * *Example*. 
        * 11 address lines are required to select one of 2048 rows

            $\to$ These $\log_2 W$ are fed into a row decoder, which has $\log_2 W$ lines of input, and $W$ lines for output
        * Additional 11 address lines select one of 2048 columns of 4 bits per column

            $\to$ Four data lines are used for the input and output of 4 bits to and from a data buffer
    * *Input (write) to data buffer*. The bit driver of each bit line is activated for a 1 or 0 according to the value of the corresponding data line
    * *Output (read) to data buffer*. The value of each bit line is passed through a sense amplifier and presented to the data lines
* *Row line*. Select which row of cells is used for reading or writing
* *Multiplexer*. In the figure above, there are only 11 address lines, i.e.A0 to A10, which is half the number we expect for a $2048\times 2048$ array

    $\to$ This is done to save on the number of pins
    * *Explain*. The 22 required address lines are passed through the select logic eternal to the chip, and multiplexed onto the 11 address lines
    * *Addressing procedure*.
        1. 11 address signals are passed to the chip to define the row address of the array
        2. The other 11 signals are presented for the column address
    * *Addressing implementation*. Use row-address-select (RAS) and column-address-select (CAS) to provide timing to the chip
    * *Consequence*. One more pin devoted to addressing doubles the number of rows and columns, thus increase the size of the memory chip by a factor of 4
* *Read and writer pins*. The write-enable (WE) and output enable (OE) pins determine whether a write or read operation is performed
* *Other pins*. Ground, i.e. $V_\text{ss}$, and voltage source, i.e. $V_\text{cc}$
* *Refresh circuitry*. All DRAMs require a refresh operation, i.e. due to the discharge of capacitors in memory cells
    * *Simplest technique*. Disable the DRAM chip wil all data cells are refreshed
        1. The refresh counter steps through all of the row values
        2. For each row, the output lines from the refresh counter are supplied to the row decoder and the RAS line is activated
        3. The data are read out and written back into the same location, causing each cell in the row to be refreshed

### Chip packaging
**Idea**. An integrated circuit is mounted on a package containing pins for connection to the outside world

**An example EPROM package**. Consider an 8 Mbit chip organized as 1M x 8

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Xk1tRsL.png">
    <figcaption>Typical memory package pins and signals</figcaption>
</div>

* *Organization*. The organization is treated as a one-word-per-chip package
* *Number of pins*. 32
* *Supported signal lines by pins*.
    * The address of the word being accessed, i.e. 20 pins for 1M words, i.e. A0 to A19
    * The data to be read out, consisting of 8 lines, i.e. D0 to D7
    * The power supply to the chip, i.e. $V_\text{cc}$
    * A ground pin $V_\text{ss}$
    * A chip enable (CE) pin
        * *Explain*. There may be more than one memory chip, each of which is connected to the same address bus

            $\to$ The CE pin is used to indicate whether or not the address is valid for this chip
        * *CE pin activation*. The CE pin is activated by logic connected to the higher-order bits of the address bus, i.e. address bits above A19
    * A program voltage $V_\text{pp}$ which is supplied during programming (write operations)

**Example of DRAM pin configuration**. Consider a 16Mbit chip organized as 4M x 4

>**NOTE**. There are several differences from a ROM chip, since a RAM can be updated, thus data pins are input and output

* *Write-enable (WE) and output-enable (OE) pins*. Indicate whether this is a write or a read operation
* *Address pines*. only 11 address pines are required to specify 4M row/column combinations
    * *Explain*. the DRAM is accessed by row and column, and th address is multiplexed
* *Row-address-select (RAS) and column-address-select (CAS) pins*. Discussed previously

### Module organization
**Number of RAM chips**. If a RAM chip contains only 1 bit per word

$\to$ We will need at least a number of chips equal to the number of bits per word

**Example of memory organization**. Consider a memory module of 256K 8-bit words

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/1odKW0l.png">
    <figcaption>256-KByte memory organization</figcaption>
</div>

* *Addressing*. An 18-bit address is required and is supplied to the memory module from some external source, e.g. the address line of a bus to which the module is attached

    $\to$ The address is presented to eight 256K x 1-bit chips, each of which provides the input / output of 1 bit

**Example of memory organization for larger memory**. Consider a memory of 1M word by 8 bits per word

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/LjPvGrE.png">
    <figcaption>1-Mbyte memory organization</figcaption>
</div>

* *Organization*. Have 4 columns of chips, each column containing 256K words arranged as in the figure above
* *Addressing*. 20 address lines are used, with 18 least significant bits routed to all 32 modules

    $\to$ The higher-order 2 bits are input to a group select logic module which sends a chip enable signal to one of the four columns of modules

### Interleaved memory
**Main memory**. Composed of a collection of DRAM memory chips

**Memory bank**. A number of chips can be grouped together to form a memory bank

**Interleaved memory**. It is possible to organize the memory banks, in a way known as interleaved memory

$\to$ Each bank is independently able to service a memory read or write request
* *Consequence*. A system with $K$ banks can service $K$ requests simultaneously, increasing memory read or write rates by a factor of $K$

    $\to$ If consecutive words of memory are stored in different banks, then the transfer of a block of memory is speeded up


## Error correction
**Types of errors**. A semiconductor memory system is subject to errors
* *Hard failure*. A permanent physical defact so that the memory cell or cells affected cannot reliably store data but become stuck at 0 or 1 or switch erratically between 0 and 1
    * *Causes*. Caused by harsh environment abuse, manufacturing defects, and wear
* *Soft error*. A random, non-destructive event which alters the content of one or more memory cells without damaging the memory
    * *Causes*. Caused by power supply problems or alpha particles, which result from radioactive decay and are distressingly common, since radioactive nuclei are found in small quantities in nearly all materials

**Handling errors**. Both hard and soft errors are undesirable, and most modern main memory systems include logic for both detecting and correcting errors

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/IpavRxf.png">
    <figcaption>Error-correcting code function</figcaption>
</div>
 
* *Writing operation*. When data are to be written into memory, a calculation, i.e. a function $f$, is performed on the data to produce a code

    $\to$ Both the code and the data are stored
    * *Actual stored word size*. If an $M$-bit word of data is to be stored and the code length is $K$
        
        $\to$ The actual size of the stored word is $M+K$ bits
* *Reading operation*. The code above is used to detect and possibly correct errors
    * *Idea*. A new set of $K$ code bits is generated from the $M$ data bits and compared with the fetched code bits
    * *Possible cases*.
        * *No errors are detected*. The fetched data are sent out
        * *An error is detected, and it is possible to correct it*. The data bits plus error correction bits are fed into a corrector, which produces a corrected set of $M$ bits to be sent out
        * *An error is detected, and it is not possible to correct it*. This condition is reported
* *Error-correcting codes*. The $K$-bit code generated as given above
    * *Code characteristics*. Characterized by the number of bit errors in a word which can be detected and corrected

**Hamming code**. The simplest of the error-correcting codes

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/785SRcs.png">
    <figcaption>Hamming error-correcting code</figcaption>
</div>

* *Idea (example)*.
    * Assign the 4 data bits to the inner compartments, i.e. as figure (a)
    * The remaining compartments are filled with parity bits, each of which is chosen so that the total number of 1s in its circle is even, i.e. as figure (b)
* *Error detection*. If an error changes one of the data bits, i.e. as figure (c)

    $\to$ It is easily found, by checking the parity bits, discrepancies are found in circle A and circle C, but not circle B
    * *Procedure*. The comparison logic receives as input two $K$-bit values, which are then compared by XOR operator

        $\to$ The result is referred as *syndrome word* 
* *Error correction*. Change the value of the detected error bit
* *Number of error-correcting bits*. The smallest number $K$ satisfying $2^K-1\geq M+K$
    * *Explain*. $K$ must be enough to detect any error in a word of $M+K$ bits

## Advanced DRAM organization
**One of most critical bottlenecks with HPC**. The interface to main internal memory

>**NOTE**. This interface is the most important pathway in the entire computer system

**History**.
* The basic building block of main memory remains the DRAM chip, as it has for decades
* Recently, there had been no significant changes in DRAM architecture since the early 1970s
    * *Explain*. The traditional DRAM chip is constrained both by its internal architecture and its interface to the processor's memory bus
* There is one attack on the performance problem of DRAM main memory, which inserts one or more levels of high-speed SRAM cache between DRAM main memory and the processor
    * *Cons*. SRAM is much costlier than DRAM, and expanding cache size beyond a certain point yields disminishing returns
* In recent years, a number of enhancements to the basic DRAM architecture  have been explored, and some of these are now on the market
    * *Recently dominant schemes*. SDRAM, DDR-DRAM, and RDRAM

**Performance comparison of some DRAM alternatives**.

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/81DhDUY.png">
    <figcaption>Performance comparison of some DRAM alternatives</figcaption>
</div>

### Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM)
**Idea**. Unlike the traditional DRAM, which is asynchronous
* The SDRAM exchanges data with the processor synchronized to an external clock signal
* The SDRAM runs at the full speed of the processor/memory bus without imposing wait states

**Reading and writing procedure compared to typical DRAM**.
* *Typical DRAM*. 
    1. The processor presents addresses and control levels to the memory, indicating that a set of data at some location in memory should be read from or written into the DRAM
    2. After a delay, the access time, the DRAM writes or reads the data
        * *Access time*. During this time delay, the DRAM performs various internal functions, e.g. 
            * Activate the high capacitance of the row and column lines
            * Sense the data
            * Rout the data out through the output buffers
        * *Consequence*. The processor must wait through this delay, slowing the system performance
* *SDRAM*. With synchronous access, the DRAM moves data in and out under control of the system clock, i.e.
    1. The processor or other master issues the instruction and address information, which is latched by the DRAM
    2. The DRAM then responds after a set number of clock cycles

        $\to$ Meanwhile, the master can safely do other tasks while the SDRAM is processing the request

**The internal logic of IBM 64-Mb SDRAM**.

<div style="text-align:center">

    <figcaption>SDRAM</figcaption>

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gS2P8YY.png">
    <figcaption>SDRAM pin assignments</figcaption>
</div>

* *Burst mode*. The SDRAM employs a burst mode to eliminate the address setup time and row and colum line precharge time after the first access
    * *Idea*. A series of data bits can be clocked out rapidly after the first bit has been accessed
    * *Usage*. Useful when all the bits to be accessed are in sequence, and in the same row of the array as the initial access
* *Memory bank*. The SDRAM has a multiple-bank internal architecture which improves opportunities for on-chip parallelism

**Mode register and associated control logic**. Another key feature differentiating SDRAMs from conventional DRAMs
* *Idea*. Provide a mechanism to customize the SDRAM to suit specific system needs
* *Mode register*. 
    * Specify the burst length, i.e. the number of seperate units of data synchronously fed onto the bus
    * Allow the programmer to adjust the latency between receipt of a read request and the beginning of data transfer

**Usage**. SDRAMs perform best when they are transferring large blocks of data serially, e.g. word processing, spreadsheets, and multimedia

**Example of read operation**. Consider the read operation of a SDRAM with burst length 4 and latency 2

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/eqycklw.png">
    <figcaption>SDRAM read timing with burst length 4 and CAS latency 2</figcaption>
</div>

1. A burst read command is initiated by having CS and CAS low while holding RAS and WE high at the rising edge of the clock
2. The address inputs determine the starting colum address for the burst, and the mode register sets the following information, i.e.
    * *Type of burst*. Sequential or interleave
    * *Burst length*. 1, 2, 4, 8, or full page
3. The delay from the start of the command, to when the data from the first cell appears on the outputs, is equal to the value of the CAS latency, which is set in the mode register

**Double-data-rate SDRAM (DDR_SDRAM)**. Overcome the one-per-cycle limitation by sending data to the processor twice per clock cycle, i.e. at the rising and the falling of clock signals

### Rambus DRAM (RDRAM) - Developed by Rambus
**RDRAM structure**. RDRAM chips are vertical packages, with all pins on one side
* *Data exchange*. The chip exchanges data with the processor over 28 wires of no more than 12 centimeters long
* *Number of RDRAM chips*. The bus can address up to 320 RDRAM chips
* *Data rate*. Up to 1.6GBps

**RDRAM bus**. Deliver address and control information using a asynchronous block-oriented protocol

$\to$ After an initial 480 ns access time, this produces 1.6GBps data rate

### DDR SDRAM (DDR SDRAM)
**Motivation**. SDRAM can only send data to the processor once per bus clock cycle

$\to$ Double-data-rate (DDR) SDRAM can send data twice per clock cycle, on the rising and falling edges of the clock pulse

**Basic timing for a DDR read**. The data transfer is synchronized to both the rising and falling edge of the clock, to a bidirectional data strobe (DQS) signal

* *DQS signal*. Provided by the memory controller during a read, and by the DRAM during a write

**Theoretical data transfer rate**. 
* *DDR*. 200 to 600 MHz
* *DDR2*. 400 to 1066 MHz
* *DDR3*. 800 to 1600 MHz

**Improvements to DDR**.
* *DDR2*. Increase the data transfer rate by 
    * Increasing the operational frequency of the RAM chip
    * Increasing the prefetch buffer from 2 bits to 4 bits per chip
        * *Prefetch buffer*. A memory cache located on the RAM chip
            * *Usage*. Enable the RAM chip to preposition bits to be placed on the data bus as rapidly as possible
* *DDR3 (2017)*. Increase the prefetch buffer size to 8 bits

### Cache DRAM (CDRAM)
**Idea**. Integrate a small SDRAM cache, e.g. 16KB, onto a generic DRAM chip

**Usage of SDRAM cache**.
* Used as a true cache consisting of a number of 64-bit lines

    $\to$ The cache mode of the CDRAM is effective for ordinary random access to memory
* Used as a buffer to support the serial access of a block of data
    * *Example*. A refresh bit-mapped screen, the CDRAM can prefetch the data from the DRAM into the SRAM buffer

        $\to$ Subsequent accesses to the chip result in accesses solely to the SRAM

## Concepts
**Burst mode**. 
* *In computing*. A generic electronics term referring to any situation, in which a device is transmitting data repeatedly without going through all the steps required to transmit each piece of data in a separate transaction
    * *Timing formula*. $t_\text{total} = t_\text{initial} + t_\text{sequential}$
* *In photography*. A shooting mode in still cameras, where the photographer captures several photos in a quick succession by either pressing the shutter button, or holding it down

**Column address strobe (CAS)**. A signal sent to a DRAM telling it that an associated address is a column address

**CAS latency (CL)**. The delay, in clock cycles, between the READ command and the moment data is available

$\to$ This is what makes SDRAM synchronous and enables pipelining for SDRAMs
