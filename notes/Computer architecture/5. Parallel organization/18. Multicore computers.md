# Multicore computers
**Multicore computer (or a chip multiprocessor)**. Combine two or more processors, i.e. cores, on a single piece of silicon, i.e. die 
* *Core architecture*. Typically consist of all of the components of an independent processor, e.g. 
    * Registers
    * ALU
    * Pipeline hardware
    * Control unit
    * L1 instruction and data caches
    * L2 cache and, increasingly, L3 cache

## Hardware performance issues
**Brief**. The steady, exponential increase in execution performance of microprocessor systems is due partly to
* Refinements in the organization of the processor on the chip, and
* The increase in clock frequency

### Increase in parallelism and complexity
**Increase in parallelism**. The organizational changes in processor design have primarily been focused on increasing instruction-level parallelism

$\to$ More work could be done in each clock cycle

* *Pipelining*. Individual instructions are executed through a pipeline of stages
  
    $\to$ While one instruction is executing in one stage of the pipeline, another instruction is executing in another stage of the pipeline
* *Superscalar*. Multiple pipelines are constructed by replicating execution resources
  
    $\to$ This enables parallel execution of instructions in parallel pipelines, so long as hazards are avoided
* *Simultaneous multithreading (SMT)*. Register banks are replicated so that multiple threads can share the use of pipeline resources

**Increase in complexity**. For each of these innovations, designers have over the years attempted to increase the performance of the system by adding complexity
* *Pipelining complexity*. Consider pipelining, simple three-stage pipelines were replaced by pipelines with five stages
    
    $\to$ Then there are many more stages, with some implementations having over a dozen stages
    * *Drawback*. There is a practical limit to how far this trend can be taken, i.e. with more stages
        
        $\to$ There is the need for more logic, more interconnections, and more control signals
* *Superscalar complexity*. Increased performance can be achieved by increasing the number of parallel pipelines
    * *Drawback*. There are diminishing returns as the number of pipelines increases
        * *Explain*. More logic is required to manage hazards and to stage instruction resources
        * *Consequence*. A single thread of execution reaches the point, where hazards and resource dependencies prevent the full use of the multiple pipelines available
* *SMT*. The same point of diminishing returns, i.e. as in superscalar, is reached with SMT
    * *Explain*. The complexity of managing multiple threads over a set of pipelines limits the number of threads and number of pipelines that can be effectively utilized

**Related problems dealing with the design and fabrication of the computer chip**. The increase in complexity to deal with all of the logical issues related to very long pipelines, multiple superscalar pipelines, and multiple SMT register banks

$\to$ This results in an increasing amounts of the chip area are occupied with coordinating and signal transfer logics
* *Consequence*. This increases the difficulty of designing, fabricating, and debugging the chips
    
    $\to$ An increasing fraction of the processor chip is devoted to the simpler memory logic
