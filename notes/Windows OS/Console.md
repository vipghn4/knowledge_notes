# Console
## Introduction
**Types of consoles for Windows**.
* *Command prompt (CMD)*. The older shell or batch language going back in some form to the original DOS OS

    >**NOTE**. There is no point learning CMD, since it is effectively deprecated at this point

* *PowerShell*. The new and vastly improved shell and programming language first available as an add-on and now included in the Windows OS

    $\to$ We can think of CMD as a subset of PowerShell

    >**NOTE**. Many system administration tasks, e.g. registry management, can be done using PowerShell but not CMD

* *Bash*. Similar to PowerShell, and they are both equally useful

    $\to$ We learn bash when we wish to switch to Linux effectively

## Command prompt
**Windows - Ubuntu correspondences**.

| Ubuntu | Windows |
