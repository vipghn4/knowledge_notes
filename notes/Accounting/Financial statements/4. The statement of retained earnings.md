# The statement of retained earnings
**The statement of retained earnings**. A very brief financial statement
* *Purpose*. Detail the changes in a company's retailed earnings over a period of time
* *Example*.

**Bridge between financial statements**. The statement of retained earnings functions much like a bridge between the income statement and the balance sheet
* *Explain*. It takes information from the income statement, and provides information to the balance sheet, i.e.
    1. The final step of preparing an income statement is the calculation of the company's net income
    2. The net income is used in the statement of retained earnings to calculate the end-of-year balance in retained earnings
    3. The ending retained earnings balance is then used to prepare the company's end-of-year balance sheet

**Dividends - Not an expense**. Dividends are cash payments made from the company to another party

$\to$ Dividends are a distribution of profits, as opposed to expenses, which reduce profits

**Retained earnings is not the same as cash**. A company has not distributed its profits to its owner does not mean it has not already used them for something else
* *Example*. Profits are frequently reinvested in growing the company by purchasing more inventory for sale, or more equipment for production

    $\to$ The retailed earnings may not be sitting around somewhere as cash in a checking or saving account
